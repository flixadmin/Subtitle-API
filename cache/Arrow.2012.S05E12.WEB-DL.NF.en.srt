MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,462
AFTER 5 YEARS IN HELL,

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,255
I RETURNED HOME
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL...

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,924
TO SAVE MY CITY.

5
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,301
TODAY, I FIGHT THAT WAR
ON TWO FRONTS.

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,679
BY DAY, I LEAD STAR CITY
AS ITS MAYOR,

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,806
BUT BY NIGHT,
I AM SOMEONE ELSE.

8
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,099
I AM...SOMETHING ELSE.

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,977
I AM THE GREEN ARROW.

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,104
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

11
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,857
REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, SERGEANT.

12
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,608
YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO SECURE THE TRIGGER.
YOU'RE STEALING IT.

13

WANT TO READ
YOUR CONFESSION
BEFORE YOU SIGN IT?

14
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,444
YOU DID THIS!

15
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,989
NO ONE WILL EVER
BELIEVE YOUR STORY.

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,699

GIVING ME THE FILE
FOR JOHN.

EXONERATE JOHN.

IT WORKS FOR ME.

YOU NEED TO GIVE
THE MONSTER AN IDENTITY.

30

IT'S ONLY WHEN
THE MONSTER BECOMES
SOMEONE ELSE,

SOME...THING ELSE
THAT YOU'RE FREE TO
BE OLIVER QUEEN.

UNDERSTAND WHAT?

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,786
THAT THE MAN WHO
EMBRACES THE DARK

42
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,704
IS NEVER WITHOUT SIGHT.

AHEM. OK. SO IS THIS
THE ORCHARD BAY FACILITY

HOW LONG UNTIL
THE...ANNOUNCEMENT?

INTO A FEW JOINT INITIATIVES

IN HUB CITY LAST WEEK.

OH, THAT'S REALLY
TOO BAD.

52
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,558

OF DEATH.

SHE'S JUST...

55
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,688
IT'S OK, OLIVER.
SHE'S NOT THE QUEEN
I'M SEEING.

56
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,232
THAT'S SORT OF
AN OLD-FASHIONED WAY
TO SAY IT, DON'T YOU THINK?

57
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,110
WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
SURE HOW ELSE TO PUT IT

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,278
GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T
PROGRESSED.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,530
THAT'S A FUNNY WAY
OF SAYING WE HAVEN'T
SLEPT TOGETHER.

I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU TODAY.

63
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,124
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT REHAB.

64
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,334
IT'S A LONG PROCESS,
AND THEN IT AIN'T,

65
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,877
AND BY THE LOOKS
OF THAT ASSISTANT
OUT THERE,

66
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,169
YOU NEED ME BACK
BAD.

67

HOW ABOUT I GIVE
YOU GUYS A MOMENT?

IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MS. WILLIAMS.

69

I WASN'T PLANNING ON
KEEPING MY PROBLEMS
A SECRET.

70
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,762
IN FACT, I WANTED
TO TALK WITH YOU

-YOU KNOW, I'M BETTER

THANKS.

79

THAT'S FANTASTIC
TO HEAR,

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,658
BUT LOOK, MAYBE
WE SHOULDN'T...

81

BY SITTING DOWN WITH
YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

82

WELL, NO. JUST...JUST
WAIT A LITTLE BIT.

ANY MORE DRY,

MOVE FORWARD,

SAY YOU'RE LATE

THE NSA's CASE
AGAINST WALKER.

CONGRATULATIONS,

I WAS WONDERING IF
THE D.A. MIGHT HAVE
A SECOND TO CHAT.

100

A STORY ON THE DEATH
OF DETECTIVE MALONE.

102

I HAVE NO COMMENT
FOR YOU.

I SPOKE TO YOU SAID

104
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,377
YOU WERE THE MAN
TO SPEAK TO.

105
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,337
IT'S A LITTLE ODD
FOR A D.A. TO BE SO INVOLVED

106
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,463
IN A POLICE MATTER.

A MEMBER OF THE ACU.

BY CITY HALL,

109

NOT BY THE SCPD.

-OH, MY GOD.
-NOT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR?

JUST TOOK GENERAL WALKER
INTO CUSTODY.

112
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,309
WALKER AND HIS MEN JUST
SHOT THEIR WAY OFF
OF FORT ZERILLO.

113

30 DEAD,

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,878
BETWEEN WALKER AND A GROUP
OF MARKOVIAN SEPARATISTS.

121

HE'S LOOKING TO
SELL THE NUKE.

122

WE CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

123

00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,517
OFF THE GRID RIGHT NOW,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

129
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,311

TO A PRIVATE PLANE.

-I'M COMING, TOO.
-FELICITY.

FOR ME, AS WELL.

NEVER LET ANOTHER
HAVENROCK HAPPEN

WHOLE UNIT WITH HIM,

00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,985
OLIVER SAID I'M SUPPOSED
TO HELP YOU PREP

155
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,528
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW
WITH SUSAN WILLIAMS

156
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,198
AND IT WAS SAFER
FOR ME TO BE HERE

157
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,406
THAN OVER THERE STARTING

158
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
AN INTERNATIONAL
INCIDENT.

159
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,827
ALSO, YOU NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR RECEPTIONIST.

160
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,369
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE
I WAS HERE FOR YOU.

161
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,997
I HAD TO SNEAK PAST HER
JUST TO GET IN.

162
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,665
WOW! I WONDER HOW SHE COULD
HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE!

163
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,501
HEH HEH.

164
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,337
LISTEN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO
US BOTH A FAVOR, ALL RIGHT?

165
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,297
JUST GO HOME, POLISH YOUR
HOCKEY MASK OR SOMETHING,

166
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,923
AND I'LL JUST TELL
OLIVER YOU WERE HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

167
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,342
THAT'S COOL, RIGHT? I'M...

168
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,886
SURE, EXCEPT YOU'RE
FRESH OUT OF REHAB,

169
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,513
NOT A POLITICIAN,
ABOUT TO FACE THE MEDIA,

170
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,932
SO WHAT'S IT HURT TO
HAVE A LITTLE HELP?

171
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,187
OH, JUST MY WAKING SANITY.
HA HA HA!

172
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,856
AHEM.

173
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,607
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, PULL UP A CHAIR.

174
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,527
ALL RIGHTIE.

175
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,321
-COFFEE?
-SURE.

176
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,368
OK. THIS WHOLE FLYING
PRIVATE THING

177
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,827
IS SOMETHING I COULD
REALLY GET USED TO.

178
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,204
BEING MAYOR HAS
ITS PERKS.

179
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,830
YOU'RE LUCKY THAT
STAR CITY'S SISTER CITY

180
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,040
IS IN RUSSIA.

181
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,499
AS OF 12 HOURS AGO
AT LEAST.

182
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,751
ARE YOU READY
FOR THIS?

183
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,002
WHEN I SIGNED ON,
I DIDN'T THINK

184
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,419
I'D BE STOPPING
A NUCLEAR ARMS DEAL

185
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,755
IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY.

186
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,173
YEAH. WHEN I SIGNED ON,
I DIDN'T THINK

187
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,591
I'D BE DEALING
WITH ALIENS.

188
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,009
-ALIENS?
-YEAH.

189
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,344
CURTIS: JOHN SAID
YOU HAD FRIENDS
IN RUSSIA.

190
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,679
ONE FRIEND. REACHED OUT,
DIDN'T HEAR BACK.

191
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,723
-OLIVER QUEEN.
-ANATOLY.

192
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,351
UNH! OHH.

193
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,145
YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
COME BACK TO RUSSIA.

194
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,901
-ANATOLY?
-ALEXI LEONOV...

195
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,694
YOU REMEMBER HIM, YES?

196
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,154
HE WAS ONE
OF YOUR BROTHERS.

197
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,157
-I CAN EXPLAIN.
-YOU ASKED FAVOR OF HIM.

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,786
HE ASKED FAVOR IN RETURN,
AND YOU PULL GUN ON HIM INSTEAD?

199
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,248
YOU KNOW WHY I CAN'T
BE SOME BRATVA THUG.

200
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,916
YOU MADE PROMISE.

201
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,085
YOU SWORE OATH,

202
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,463
AND NOW ONE OF YOUR
BROTHERS IS DEAD,

203
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,259
SO WHY SHOULD I WELCOME
YOU AS BROTHER?

204
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,927
GO HOME, OLIVER.

205
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,138
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU HERE.

206
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,983
FELICITY: OHH.
FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY

207
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,525
DIED OF TUBERCULOSIS
IN HERE.

208
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,694
RORY: WHAT'S THE RUSSIAN
WORD FOR CREEPY?

209
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,863
CURTIS: ZHUTKO.

210
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,407
I WAS STUDYING
ON THE PLANE.

211
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,867
WHERE DID YOU FIND
THIS PLACE?

212
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,704
JOHN: LYLA. THIS USED
TO BE AN ARGUS SAFE HOUSE,

213
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,207
AND AS YOU CAN TELL
FROM AMERO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS,

214
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,667
IT HASN'T BEEN USED
MUCH LATELY.

215
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,960
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

216
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,962
AND WHY AREN'T WE
WORKING WITH ARGUS?

217
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,089
I ASSUME PREVENTING
BLACK MARKET NUCLEAR DEALS

218
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,590
WOULD BE PRETTY HIGH
ON THEIR TO-DO LIST.

219
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,967
JOHN'S RIGHT
ABOUT RUSSIA.

220
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,469
ARGUS CAN'T OPERATE
HERE WITHOUT CAUSING

221
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,053
A DIPLOMATIC CRISIS.

222
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,472
FELICITY: OH, YEAH. SPEAKING
OF DIPLOMATIC CRISES,

223
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,639
WHY DID YOUR FRIEND
PUNCH YOU?

224
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,016
3 YEARS AGO, I USED
A BRATVA CONTACT

225
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,268
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO
TRACK SLADE WILSON.

226
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,811
HE ASKED ME
FOR SOMETHING
IN EXCHANGE.

227
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,688
I REFUSED.

228
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,023
SLADE KILLED HIM.

229
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,152
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK UNTIL WE'RE
UP AND RUNNING?

230
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,528
I'M NOT SURE.
I'M PRETTY MUCH STARTING

231
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,821
FROM SCRATCH HERE,
AND I HAVE TO HACK

232
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,281
THE RUSSIAN SERVER TO SEE
IF WE CAN FIND

233
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,367
ANY CHATTER ON WALKER,
AND THAT MIGHT TAKE NO TIME,

234
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,243
OR IT MIGHT TAKE
A...A LOT OF TIME.

235
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,204
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
BRATVA FRIEND WITH
THE GOOD RIGHT HOOK?

236
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,413
YOU COULD TRY
MAKING NICE.

237
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,956
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

238
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,416
YEAH? WELL, SIMPLE
OR NOT, OLIVER,

239
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,335
WE HAVE TO USE
EVERY ASSET WE'VE GOT.

240
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,730
I MADE A MISTAKE
WITH LEONOV.

241
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,150
IT WAS A CHALLENGING TIME,

242
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,445
BUT YOU STILL OWE ME
FOR GREGOR.

243
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,915
LUCKY FOR YOU,
I NEVER LIKED LEONOV.

244
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,252
SIT. JOHN DIGGLE,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

245
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,295
NOW YOU'RE
MY FAVORITE AMERICAN.

246
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,796
THANKS.

247
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,007
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO RUSSIA?

248
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,468
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A U.S. GENERAL THAT
HAS GONE ROGUE.

249
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,053
WE HAVE REASON TO
BELIEVE HE'S TRYING

250
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,514
TO SELL A NUKE
TO MARKOVIAN
TERRORISTS.

251
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,099
WHAT CONCERN IS THAT
OF YOURS?

252
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,894
ARE YOU GONNA HELP
ME FIND THIS MAN
OR NOT?

253
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,772
AFTER BUSINESS
WITH LEONOV,

254
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:10,569
JUST ME SITTING
WITH YOU SQUARES US
WITH GREGOR, YES?

255
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,448
-FINE.
-THEN WE ARE EVEN

256
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,533
AND BACK TO HOW THINGS
WORK IN BRATVA.

257
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,951
I HELP YOU,
YOU HELP ME.

258
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,203
AN ARRANGEMENT
YOU REFUSED WITH LEONOV

259
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,662
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

260
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,832
AN ARRANGEMENT I'M
GOING TO REFUSE AGAIN.

261
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,336
THAT PART OF MY LIFE
IS OVER.

262
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,380
WELL, THEN I CANNOT
HELP YOU,

263
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,091
BUT I CAN OFFER YOU
SOME FREE ADVICE.

264
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,385
ACT QUICKLY, OLIVER.

265
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,721
THE MARKOVIANS DO NOT,
AS YOU AMERICANS SAY,

266
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,681
SIT ON THEIR HANDS.

267
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,315
YOU DID WELL.

268
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,942
YOU'VE PROVEN TO BE
A MOST ADEPT STUDENT.

269
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,736
I KNOW A FEW TEACHERS
WHO WOULD DISAGREE
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT.

270
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,700
HIDEO YAMANE...HIS NAME'S
IN MY FATHER'S NOTEBOOK.

271
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,787
FOR GOOD REASON.
MR. YAMANE'S
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE

272
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,872
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH
OF THE DESIGNER DRUG TRADE

273
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,291
IN STARLING CITY.

274
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,376
I THINK YOU'LL RECOGNIZE
HIS CHIEF PRODUCT.

275
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,718
MY SISTER WAS
USING THIS,

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,514
SO I KILLED HER DEALER,

277
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,349
BUT I DIDN'T CONSIDER
THE SUPPLY.

278
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,477
I LEFT HER,
I LEFT THE CITY VULNERABLE.

279
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,270
THIS IS WHY I FOUND
YOU, OLIVER,

280
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,814
SO YOU CAN CORRECT
YOUR MISTAKES.

281
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,193
NOW MR. YIMANE IS
IN TOWN TONIGHT,

282
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,069
MEETING WITH HIS
RUSSIAN CONTACTS.

283
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,032
HE'S A CAREFUL MAN.
HE'LL BE HEAVILY
GUARDED.

284
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,200
AM I READY?

285
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,076
THAT'S WHAT WE
FIND OUT TONIGHT.

286
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,623
[CANARY CRY]

287
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,676
SORRY. I DON'T REALLY
HAVE MUCH CONTROL
BEYOND ON AND OFF.

288
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,135
YEAH, PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU JUST PRODUCED THE SOUND

289
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,845
OF A THOUSAND BEYONCÉS.

290
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,805
I MEAN, POLYPHONICS
DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN

291
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,265
TO EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

292
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,143
FELICITY: CAN YOU GUYS
PLEASE...KEEP IT DOWN?

293
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,727
OK. WALKER HAS GONE
COMPLETELY DARK.

294
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,813
THERE IS NO WAY OF PINPOINTING
HIS IP OR HIS GPS

295
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,275
FROM HIS PHONE,
WHICH IS PROBABLY
JUST A BURNER ANYWAY.

296
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,527
THAT'S GOOD.

297
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,070
HOW IS THAT GOOD?

298
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,821
MILITARY MEN TEND
TO BE CREATURES
OF HABIT.

299
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,615
IF WALKER'S USING
A BURNER,

300
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,450
ODDS ARE IT'S
THE SAME MODEL HE
USED IN THE STATES.

301
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,994
AND THE ONLY ONE MAKING
CALLS TO THE MARKOVIANS.

302
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,715
WALKER'S FLIP PHONE
OF CHOICE IS AN OLD MODEL.

303
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,467
THE ONLY NETWORK HERE
THAT SUPPORTS IT IS
DETRALINK DST.

304
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,094
CURTIS: CAN YOU HACK IT?

305
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,721
I MEAN, I COULD,
BUT IT WOULD TAKE
