1
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,177
<i>Hi, I'm Scott Derrickson,</i>

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,218
<i>the director of</i> Doctor Strange.

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:11,012
<i>We're looking here
at the new Marvel logo.</i>

4
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:16,309
<i>It was introduced on</i> Doctor Strange
<i>when it first hit theaters.</i>

5
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:19,187
<i>I'm in a very interesting situation
doing this commentary track</i>

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,189
<i>because the movie's not come out yet.</i>

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,943
<i>It's the day before the premiere
here in LA.</i>

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:30,281
<i>So, I'm doing this commentary track,
for better or for worse,</i>

9
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:36,204
<i>without knowing audience reactions
or critical reactions</i>

10
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,332
<i>or box office performance.</i>

11
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,543
<i>Which is good in a way, I think,</i>

12
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:47,006
<i>because my approach to filmmaking,
and this wasn't always the case,</i>

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,050
<i>but my approach to filmmaking now,</i>

14
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,429
<i>and I think what I've grown
and matured into,</i>

15
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:58,059
<i>is a philosophical perspective
about making a movie,</i>

16
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:01,146
<i>about filmmaking in general.</i>

17
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,234
<i>And that perspective is that,
as an artist, as a director,</i>

18
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:12,365
<i>my goal, my intention, is to pick
a good target for a movie,</i>

19
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:15,744
<i>that I believe people will want to see
and will get their money's worth out of.</i>

20
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:21,082
<i>And that's meaningful to me as
a creative person, and to hit that target.</i>

21
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,918
<i>And if I've done that,
if I've picked a good target</i>

22
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,172
<i>and I've hit that target,
that's the reward.</i>

23
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:30,925
<i>That's really the only reward
that you get as a filmmaker.</i>

24
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>It's a huge reward.
It's the ultimate reward.</i>

25
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,305
<i>But it's the only one you can count on,</i>

26
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:39,976
<i>because I've experienced
both good and bad,</i>

27
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,646
<i>that movies surprise you in the way
that audiences sometimes respond,</i>

28
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>the way that critics
sometimes respond,</i>

29
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,109
<i>the way the box office performs.</i>

30
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:51,446
<i>Sometimes it's a good surprise.
Sometimes it's a bad surprise.</i>

31
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,864
<i>Sometimes it's a mixture of both.</i>

32
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,908
<i>It's never quite what you expect.</i>

33
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:59,496
<i>And so, you can't really rely upon</i>

34
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:04,292
<i>critical reactions or box office</i>

35
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,797
<i>to tell you whether or not
you did a good job on a movie,</i>

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,007
<i>whether or not making a movie
was worthwhile.</i>

37
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,220
<i>You have to depend upon whether or
not you hit the target you aimed at.</i>

38
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,765
<i>And I think the one opinion
that does matter</i>

39
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,642
<i>is the audience
that pays to see the movie.</i>

40
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:24,646
<i>I think that they're the ones
that any movie is made for.</i>

41
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,274
<i>And I take that responsibility seriously.
I do want them to like it.</i>

42
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,945
<i>And in this case, we'll find out.</i>

43
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,406
<i>But I have not watched it
with an audience yet.</i>

44
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,784
<i>I'll do that for the first time
tomorrow night.</i>

45
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,205
<i>So, everything that you're gonna hear
from me is a blind perspective</i>

46
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:46,501
<i>in terms of critical, audience
and box office response.</i>

47
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:52,173
<i>We'll start by talking about London,
which we're in right here.</i>

48
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:53,633
<i>Shooting in London.</i>

49
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,261
<i>It was the primary place
that we shot Kathmandu.</i>

50
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:02,725
<i>I wanted Kamar-Taj,
the hub of sorcery,</i>

51
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:08,106
<i>to be global, and to have
a placement all over the world.</i>

52
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,611
<i>And so, Strange travels
in the movie all the way to Nepal,</i>

53
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,321
<i>and that's where the movie opened.</i>

54
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,283
<i>And go through a doorway
and now you're in London.</i>

55
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,703
<i>So, Kamar-Taj
as a compound, technically,</i>

56
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,288
<i>is set in four different cities.</i>

57
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,291
<i>It's in two cities in the east
and two cities in the west.</i>

58
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,293
<i>New York and London in the west,</i>

59
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,421
<i>and Hong Kong and Kathmandu
in the east.</i>

60
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,092
<i>That was important to me
just because of the mythology.</i>

61
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,887
<i>Not for really any other reason
than that.</i>

62
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,975
<i>It was not wanting to make
the obvious mistake</i>

63
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,186
<i>of having it be too American-centric</i>

64
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,315
<i>when sorcerers
are protecting the Earth,</i>

65
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:54,235
<i>not just the western world
and certainly not just America.</i>

66
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,988
<i>This visual effects sequence</i>

67
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,075
<i>is the first big visual effects sequence
in the movie.</i>

68
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,747
<i>The term that we use for
the fractal work that you see in terms...</i>

69
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,708
<i>That's the technical
mathematical formula</i>

70
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,836
<i>of the metal and stone
manipulations here.</i>

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,591
<i>We call it Mandelbrotting,
which I think is a correct term.</i>

72
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,968
<i>But it was a visual effect that I'd seen</i>

73
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:22,347
<i>on various YouTube videos
and GIFs and stuff like that online.</i>

74
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,641
<i>And I was always mesmerized by it
when I saw it.</i>

75
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,184
<i>And as we started to work</i>

76
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,812
<i>with this fractal patterning
and spatial manipulation,</i>

77
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,942
<i>it became an increasingly important
storytelling device.</i>

78
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,778
<i>And that's what that opening scene
was meant to do,</i>

79
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,447
<i>is to introduce a visual language</i>

80
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,786
<i>of weirdness and magic
that we haven't seen before.</i>

81
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:50,416
<i>I like stories about magic very much
and I love the idea of a magical world.</i>

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,710
<i>But I do feel like, in cinema,</i>

83
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:57,924
<i>magic has grown
a little tired and familiar.</i>

84
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,801
<i>And we rely so much on tropes.</i>

85
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,388
<i>But I'll get back to that
when we get back to Kamar-Taj.</i>

86
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>This sequence here is pretty detailed</i>

87
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:13,648
<i>in its accuracy of people in position
for a surgery like this.</i>

88
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,316
<i>For a brain surgery.</i>

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,819
<i>For a doctor doing
what a neurosurgeon does.</i>

90
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,697
<i>We had a specialist with us at all times.</i>

91
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>We rehearsed with all of the actors</i>

92
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,453
<i>to make sure that everything that they
were doing was real and proper.</i>

93
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,206
<i>And no one's gonna know
that except for brain surgeons.</i>

94
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,000
<i>Literally, brain surgeons.</i>

95
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,253
<i>No one else will know,
so why do it?</i>

96
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:42,051
<i>I feel that accuracy in professions
is something that audiences can feel.</i>

97
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>That when you're cheating
something technical in a profession,</i>

98
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,433
<i>they may not know it,
but somehow they feel it.</i>

99
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:53,521
<i>And somehow it does not come across
as accurate.</i>

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,524
<i>And my wife is a nurse also.</i>

101
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,486
<i>So, I get a lot of flak if ever I do
anything improper, medically.</i>

102
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,866
<i>So, I suppose that's probably
the greater of the two reasons</i>

103
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,035
<i>for so much medical accuracy.</i>

104
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,786
<i>But it's also rooted in the character.</i>

105
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,790
<i>The title is</i> Doctor Strange, <i>here he is.
He's a doctor.</i>

106
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:17,670
<i>And even though he ends the movie
by becoming a sorcerer</i>

107
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:21,674
<i>and he loses the use of his hands
and can no longer be a neurosurgeon,</i>

108
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,343
<i>he never stops being a doctor.</i>

109
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,638
<i>And I think that that's a critical
aspect of his character</i>

110
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,309
<i>that we're setting up here,
that he is very good at his profession.</i>

111
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,854
<i>And doctors take a Hippocratic oath.</i>

112
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:39,484
<i>They are required,
and make a literal oath,</i>

113
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,568
<i>to do no harm.</i>

114
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>And so, when you've got a superhero
engaging in combat and fighting,</i>

115
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,744
<i>and as we find out later,
kills somebody,</i>

116
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,162
<i>it doesn't set well with him.</i>

117
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,332
<i>And he's gonna have
a different moral code.</i>

118
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,585
<i>By nature, even though
he's a selfish egotistical guy,</i>

119
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,254
<i>he still takes
his Hippocratic oath seriously</i>

120
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:04,008
<i>and still cares very much
about being a doctor.</i>

121
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,219
<i>This is another scene
where we went out of our way</i>

122
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,638
<i>to keep everything
as accurate as possible.</i>

123
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,182
<i>This initial phase of the surgery</i>

124
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,811
<i>would have taken place
without surgical masks,</i>

125
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:19,148
<i>and then when they get
the MRI machine into place,</i>

126
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,566
<i>they would put the masks on.</i>

127
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,861
<i>So, if you're wondering why there's no
masks, and then they have masks,</i>

128
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,866
<i>it's because of the urgency of getting
into the position to remove the bullet,</i>

129
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,618
<i>and then they bring this in.</i>

130
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,120
<i>Again, small things,</i>

131
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,498
<i>but they make a difference
in the way something feels.</i>

132
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:44,048
<i>As far as adapting the comic book</i>
Doctor Strange <i>into a movie,</i>

133
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:46,467
<i>I had a very definite approach</i>

134
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,387
<i>coming into Marvel
when I met with them.</i>

135
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:54,225
<i>I had to go through
eight different meetings to get the job.</i>

136
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,768
<i>I remember counting them.</i>

137
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:59,814
<i>And there were a lot of people
vying for the job.</i>

138
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>And there were a lot of people
who were trying</i>

139
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>to become the director
of</i> Doctor Strange.

140
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:10,658
<i>And I'll say, to start with,
that to Kevin Feige's great credit,</i>

141
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:16,038
<i>he hires, oftentimes, unlikely people
to do big movies for them.</i>

142
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,332
<i>I don't think another studio</i>

143
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,376
<i>would have hired James Gunn</i>

144
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,212
<i>to do a movie the size of</i>
Guardians of the Galaxy.

145
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:28,551
<i>Certainly no studio was ever
considering hiring the Russo brothers,</i>

146
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,931
<i>who'd worked mostly in television,
to direct a massive tentpole movie.</i>

147
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:43,024
<i>And nobody would've considered me
to do a movie of this scale.</i>

148
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:47,028
<i>Especially when the only time
I ever made a big budget movie</i>

149
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,654
<i>was</i> The Day the Earth Stood Still.

150
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,531
<i>That was a movie that was,
I don't know,</i>

151
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,658
<i>a third of the budget of this, I guess.</i>

152
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:56,454
<i>Certainly, half or greater.</i>

153
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,085
<i>They respect passion,
experience, and talent.</i>

154
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>And I had, I think,
proven my filmmaking skill</i>

155
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,968
<i>in the horror genre
and success in that genre,</i>

156
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,094
<i>and they knew my movies.</i>

157
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:17,266
<i>And so, I was one of many people
that was invited to meet initially.</i>

158
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,686
<i>And I knew the comics,
and I loved the comics.</i>

159
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,396
<i>I grew up reading Marvel comics,</i>

160
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,276
<i>and</i> Doctor Strange
<i>is my favorite comic book,</i>

161
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,029
<i>and feels uniquely
suited to my sensibility,</i>

162
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,156
<i>which is why
I always connected with it.</i>

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,741
<i>When I met with Marvel,</i>

164
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,662
<i>I had a very strong point of view
about</i> Doctor Strange.

165
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,914
<i>What made the comic book great,</i>

166
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,876
<i>what made Doctor Strange
an interesting character,</i>

167
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,924
<i>what made the visual nature
of every iteration of</i> Doctor Strange

168
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,759
<i>unique and important.</i>

169
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,636
<i>And to my surprise,</i>

170
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,930
<i>my thoughts lined up
quite nicely with their thoughts.</i>

171
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>And when I knew
that that was the case,</i>

172
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,436
<i>it was almost like
a switch went off in my brain</i>

173
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,730
<i>and I just decided,
"I'm gonna get this job.</i>

174
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:09,235
<i>"I'm gonna outwork everyone.
I'm gonna show them the movie.</i>

175
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,946
<i>"I'm gonna spend
a lot of my own money," which I did.</i>

176
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,699
<i>"And I'm gonna write scenes,"
which I did,</i>

177
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,079
<i>"and really present to them what</i>
Doctor Strange <i>is gonna be like."</i>

178
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,791
<i>And it all goes back
to those '60s comics.</i>

179
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,876
<i>And speaking of the '60s,</i>

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,381
<i>I love the fact that Pink Floyd's</i>
Interstellar Overdrive <i>is here.</i>

181
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,341
<i>One of the first great
psychedelic albums.</i>

182
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,344
<i>1968, I believe.</i>

183
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:42,685
<i>In the '60s, in this psychedelic era,</i>

184
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,647
<i>in the cultural revolution
that was happening at the time,</i>

185
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:51,444
<i>Stan Lee's comic books were already
very popular coming out of the '50s.</i>

186
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:55,406
Spider-Man, Iron Man,
Captain America, The Incredible Hulk.

187
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,076
<i>These were very popular comic books.</i>

188
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,705
<i>And here comes
Doctor Strange in the '60s,</i>

189
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,916
<i>first in a volume called</i> Strange Tales

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,545
<i>and then in his own
self-titled comic books.</i>

191
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:14,258
<i>A character who is not like
the rest of the MCU,</i>

192
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,803
<i>primarily because he deals with magic</i>

193
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,891
<i>and the supernatural and sorcery
and other dimensions.</i>

194
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:25,811
<i>And I think that at the time,</i>

195
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:30,149
<i>Stan Lee and Steve Ditko were feeling
what was happening in the world,</i>

196
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,026
<i>that people were opening their minds,</i>

197
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,029
<i>people were finding new ways
of looking at things.</i>

198
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,992
<i>The psychedelia of art</i>

199
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:43,079
<i>that was beginning to explode
at that time,</i>

200
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,207
<i>in the mid-'60s into the late '60s.</i>

201
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,666
<i>They were a part of that.</i>

202
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,545
<i>And the images that Steve Ditko drew</i>

203
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:55,132
<i>are still progressive
and still psychedelic and amazing.</i>

204
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,969
<i>And the origin story
always comes down to</i>

205
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,180
<i>what we've seen on the screen so far.</i>

206
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:05,851
<i>And this is true for every new
generation of</i> Doctor Strange <i>comics.</i>

207
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:08,229
<i>A neurosurgeon who's arrogant,</i>

208
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:14,026
<i>full of himself, not the nicest guy.</i>

209
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,447
<i>He's charming,
but not Tony Stark charming.</i>

210
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:24,120
<i>He's more materialistic,
he's more career-driven.</i>

211
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:30,626
<i>He's really in need of moral
and spiritual enlightenment.</i>

212
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,545
<i>And then he gets into a car crash,</i>

213
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,342
<i>and even though he thinks
his life is awesome,</i>

214
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,675
<i>he thinks his life is amazing,
he has everything he wants,</i>

215
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:43,806
<i>little does he know
he's actually quite vacant and shallow.</i>

216
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:49,562
<i>And even though he might be happy
or satisfied with his life,</i>

217
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,772
<i>his life is in fact empty.</i>

218
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:55,484
<i>And this is the event
that changes everything.</i>

219
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:58,696
<i>This car accident
that crushes his hands.</i>

220
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,576
<i>And it's obviously not the loss
of his hands that's so significant.</i>

221
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,995
<i>It's the loss of his identity as a doctor.</i>

222
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,248
<i>It's the loss of what made him
Stephen Strange,</i>

223
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,708
<i>what made him Doctor Strange.</i>

224
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,293
<i>It was the source of his income</i>

225
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,838
<i>and it was the source
of his inflated ego.</i>

226
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,174
<i>And it was taken away from him.</i>

227
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:23,137
<i>And I think that part
of what always appealed to me</i>

228
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,306
<i>about the comics of</i> Doctor Strange

229
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:31,479
<i>was this very idea
of a character who is defined</i>

230
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,565
<i>by a certain kind of egocentrism,</i>

231
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:40,988
<i>and defined by expertise
and money and success,</i>

232
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,740
<i>but then encounters</i>

233
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,619
<i>what by any definition
is a real tragedy.</i>

234
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,079
<i>It's certainly a real trauma.</i>

235
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:56,045
<i>And I really believe
that tragedy and trauma are just that.</i>

236
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,608
<i>They're tragedies and traumas,
and I don't wish them on anyone.</i>

237
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,636
<i>But I think
that they also are, oftentimes,</i>

238
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:08,682
<i>the very things that are necessary in
our lives to dislodge us from ourselves</i>

239
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,851
<i>and to reckon with who we really are.</i>

240
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,436
<i>To assess our own lives,</i>

241
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,149
<i>and to reconsider
the life that we're living</i>

242
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,776
<i>and who we're meant to be.</i>

243
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,488
<i>And that's what happens
to Stephen Strange.</i>

244
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,909
<i>He doesn't become reflective
about his life quickly,</i>

245
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,704
<i>because he's so entrenched
in his own egocentrism</i>

246
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,082
<i>and in his own drive
and his own career success.</i>

247
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,878
<i>And yet, this trauma is gonna force him
into that reckoning.</i>

248
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,923
<i>It's gonna force him
to deal with himself.</i>

249
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:45,761
<i>And he's fortunate because he doesn't
give up on his quest for healing.</i>

250
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,848
<i>He doesn't start to look inside
or look for a different way of life.</i>

251
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,561
<i>He doesn't look for a way of becoming
a better person or moving on.</i>

252
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,730
<i>He only is driven
to return to his old life.</i>

253
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,483
<i>And yet,
his old life is completely over.</i>

254
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,360
<i>It will never be the same.</i>

255
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,280
<i>It has been taken from him,
and it won't be returned.</i>

256
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:09,743
<i>And the comic books repeatedly told
that origin story over generations.</i>

257
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,121
<i>Every time they rebooted</i>
Doctor Strange,

258
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,874
<i>that would always be the story,
because it's such a good one.</i>

259
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,751
<i>It's such an interesting story.</i>

260
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:22,506
<i>And I felt like that was probably
the most critical thing</i>

261
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,760
<i>that had to be preserved
in making a</i> Doctor Strange <i>movie.</i>

262
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,762
<i>That basic setup.</i>

263
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:33,767
<i>Then the meeting of the Ancient One,
and an introduction to sorcery.</i>

264
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,022
<i>And other than that,
there were a lot of different things</i>

265
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:43,193
<i>that could be taken or left
from the comics, in terms of story.</i>

266
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,654
<i>But the one other thing, fundamentally,</i>

267
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:49,450
<i>that I felt had to remain
in a movie adaptation</i>

268
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:54,580
<i>was the visual ambition
of Steve Ditko's artwork.</i>

269
00:15:54,663 --> 00:16:00,210
<i>He was an artist
who drew things back in the '60s</i>

270
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,964
<i>that are still progressive,
and still unique.</i>

271
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:07,551
<i>I think some of the greatest
comic book panels ever drawn</i>

272
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:11,221
<i>were in</i> Doctor Strange
<i>in those early Lee/Ditko comics.</i>

273
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:16,060
<i>And the movie is based very uniquely
on those comics,</i>

274
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:20,356
<i>and a lot of the visuals
are drawn heavily from the comics.</i>

275
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,318
<i>There are other comic book
influences that we'll talk about later.</i>

276
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:29,281
<i>But it's proper and good to say,
first and foremost,</i>

277
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,537
<i>this movie was made out of respect
for those Lee/Ditko comics.</i>

278
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,583
<i>Now, this scene is one of
my favorite scenes in the movie.</i>

279
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,670
<i>Partly because it's surprising</i>

280
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:46,507
<i>as a scene within
a comic book movie to me.</i>

281
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,512
<i>Every time I would watch the scene
cut together in the editing room,</i>

282
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:57,226
<i>I felt like I was looking
at some indie film</i>

283
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,021
<i>that we shot in an apartment
in New York.</i>

284
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:04,316
<i>And it just has a quality
of performance and drama</i>

285
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,197
<i>that's not typical for comic book movies
and event movies.</i>

286
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,449
<i>But again, I think this gets to the heart</i>

287
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,869
<i>of why Kevin Feige
picked me to do this movie.</i>

288
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:20,207
<i>He looked at
my background in horror,</i>

289
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,669
<i>and saw a tendency I think that I have,</i>

290
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,047
<i>a creative tendency,
and a creative instinct,</i>

291
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,717
<i>which is, number one,
I'm drawn to stories</i>

292
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,052
<i>about the fantastical
and the supernatural,</i>

293
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:36,014
<i>and the metaphysical,
the paranormal, the magical.</i>

294
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,600
<i>Those are the stories
I'm equipped to tell,</i>

295
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,018
<i>and I tell by nature.</i>

296
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,311
<i>I'm drawn to them.</i>

297
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,063
<i>Those are the stories that are in me.</i>

298
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>But specifically,
I tell those stories through,</i>

299
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,444
<i>to the best of my ability,</i>

300
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:53,157
<i>grounded characters and realistic
characters played by good actors.</i>

301
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,202
<i>I had Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson
in an exorcism movie.</i>

302
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,497
<i>And Ethan Hawke, in</i> Sinister.

303
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>Eric Bana and Edgar Ramírez
in</i> Deliver Us from Evil.

304
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,339
<i>These are all characters
who are very realistic</i>

305
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,885
<i>and have heavy dramatic scenes
within the movie.</i>

306
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,595
<i>And in this case,</i>

307
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:18,932
<i>you've got Rachel McAdams
and Benedict Cumberbatch,</i>

308
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:24,688
<i>very serious actors who've been
nominated or won Academy Awards.</i>

309
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:30,861
<i>Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor,
Mads Mikkelsen, they're all so good.</i>

310
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,449
<i>And they're not the kind of actors
you would immediately associate</i>

311
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:39,286
<i>with a supernatural movie,
or a superhero movie.</i>

312
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,750
<i>And it's the reason I liked getting
actors like that into films like this,</i>

313
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:50,881
<i>because my philosophy of it,
my directorial perspective,</i>

314
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,133
<i>my directorial approach is that</i>

315
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:58,222
<i>the more realistic and the more
grounded and the more relatable</i>

316
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,809
<i>in terms of real human drama
a character is,</i>

317
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,814
<i>the more powerful and realistic
and effective the fantastical is</i>

318
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,649
<i>when it enters into the movie.</i>

319
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:13,654
<i>And so, by this point in the film,
other than the opening teaser,</i>

320
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,074
<i>nothing magical or fantastical or weird</i>

321
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,828
<i>has happened to Stephen Strange,</i>

322
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,413
<i>and it's not going to
until he meets the Ancient One.</i>

323
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:29,545
<i>But what we're doing here is not just
setting up the deflation of his ego</i>

324
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,338
<i>through this traumatic accident.</i>

325
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,924
<i>But we're also setting up
the realism of the world.</i>

326
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,177
<i>We're setting up a guy
in the real world.</i>

327
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,346
<i>In this case,
you really feel like this is a...</i>

328
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,935
<i>I think, at least to me,
it feels like a guy who's on the outs,</i>

329
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:49,731
<i>and is tumbling down the landslide
of his own ego</i>

330
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,026
<i>and he's in this gritty
New York environment,</i>

331
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,279
<i>so desperate,
he's reaching out to this stranger</i>

332
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,990
<i>who he knows was healed from</i>

333
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,118
<i>what he considers to be
an inoperable injury.</i>

334
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:06,832
<i>And I think all of this done
as realistically as it is,</i>

335
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:12,713
<i>as opposed to with more, 
pop sensibility or...</i>

336
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,591
<i>There's just a tone
that a lot of event movies have,</i>

337
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,260
<i>where things aren't taken so seriously.</i>

338
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,596
<i>I think that would've been a mistake
for</i> Doctor Strange

339
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,101
<i>because we're going to push
the unreality of the movie so far.</i>

340
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,730
<i>And we're gonna get into
such weirdness later on,</i>

341
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,773
<i>that the more we ground it here,</i>

342
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,569
<i>the more that weirdness
will be believable and effective.</i>

343
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:40,949
<i>And I think that the more the audience
feels that fantastical being real,</i>

344
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,412
<i>the more it reflects on the characters,</i>

345
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,912
<i>and it becomes
a synergistic relationship</i>

346
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:49,249
<i>between drama and the metaphysical,</i>

347
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,337
<i>magical, and mystical nature
of the movie.</i>

348
00:20:54,671 --> 00:21:01,303
<i>It is a movie about magic,
and I didn't want magic to feel familiar.</i>

349
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,639
<i>And I wanted it to be
encountered in a way</i>

350
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,099
<i>that we haven't encountered it before.</i>

351
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,770
<i>And all of this is a setup for that.</i>

352
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,230
<i>Now, this is a big break point
in the movie,</i>

353
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,359
<i>when we go to Nepal.</i>

354
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,693
<i>Now, why Nepal?</i>

355
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,780
<i>This is a question
I've been asked before.</i>

356
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,949
<i>A variety of reasons.</i>

357
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,325
<i>One, I hinted at earlier,</i>

358
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:27,663
<i>which is I really wanted two cities
in the east representing Kamar-Taj,</i>

359
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:33,085
<i>and I knew Hong Kong was gonna be
the final one mostly for visual reasons,</i>

360
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,671
<i>just because of the look of that city
and what we do with it,</i>

361
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,090
<i>this putting back together of the city.</i>

362
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,469
<i>But I wanted one
that was another eastern city</i>

363
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:47,265
<i>that was less familiar,
that wasn't East Asian.</i>

364
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,977
<i>And we scouted a bunch of places.</i>

365
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,148
<i>But when I went to Kathmandu,
I felt like Strange looks here.</i>

366
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,236
<i>This overwhelmed disorientation</i>

367
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,655
<i>at the stimulus of the place,</i>

368
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,784
<i>and the visual power of the place,
and the uniqueness of it.</i>

369
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:11,957
<i>And Kathmandu is a really astonishing
place to visit as a white westerner</i>

370
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,670
<i>because of its incredible energy
to start with.</i>

371
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:21,466
<i>Hordes of people walking all the time.
Just people everywhere.</i>

372
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:25,012
<i>It's much more crowded
than New York City.</i>

373
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,515
<i>It's just wall-to-wall people
and bikes and mopeds.</i>

374
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,685
<i>And yet unlike any American city
I've been to,</i>

375
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,813
<i>there is an odd,
ineffable peace about it.</i>

376
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:38,191
<i>And people don't honk their horns.
People are patient.</i>

377
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:44,364
<i>And the visual texture of the city
is extraordinarily unique.</i>

378
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,033
<i>And having visited there,</i>

379
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,535
<i>I was surprised that more films
haven't been done there</i>

380
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:52,247
<i>because it is so visually fantastic.</i>

381
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:57,586
<i>Now, we scouted there
and made the decision to shoot there,</i>

382
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,047
<i>but then the earthquake
in Nepal happened</i>

383
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,967
<i>between our scout
and the beginning of pre-production.</i>

384
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,218
<i>And there were discussions</i>

385
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,555
<i>about whether or not we were gonna
go there to shoot because, is it safe?</i>

386
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,198
<i>Is there gonna be another one?
That was a devastating earthquake.</i>

387
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,979
<i>It also destroyed a lot of
the locations we wanted to shoot in.</i>

388
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,149
<i>There were places
that were reduced to rubble.</i>

389
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,319
<i>And when we were shooting there,
there were piles of rubble everywhere</i>

390
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,906
<i>because they were still cleaning it out
and clearing it out,</i>

391
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,509
<i>and they didn't really have
anywhere to take all of this rubble.</i>

392
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,912
<i>Well, Benedict and I
had a conversation about it</i>

393
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,414
<i>and we both agreed
that the earthquake</i>

394
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,625
<i>was all the more reason to shoot there.</i>

395
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,420
<i>That tourism is such an important</i>

396
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:44,091
<i>source of income for Kathmandu.</i>

397
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,551
<i>Their economy really depends upon it.</i>

398
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,847
<i>And so, we knew
that they had taken a huge hit,</i>

399
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,974
<i>and that people
were afraid to go there.</i>

400
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,142
<i>And so, we said,</i>

401
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:59,481
<i>"Hey, let's go there and shoot it
the way that we experienced it"</i>

402
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>"when I first visited,"</i>

403
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:06,113
<i>"and possibly, help put it
back on the map a bit."</i>

404
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,074
<i>And we gave a lot
of the Nepalese jobs,</i>

405
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,785
<i>people who were out of work
because of the earthquake.</i>

406
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:18,333
<i>And a lot of extras, crew members,
all kinds of positions.</i>

407
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,709
<i>And it was fantastic.</i>

408
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,253
<i>I really loved being there.</i>

409
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:25,507
<i>I loved the way it smelled,
I loved the people that I met,</i>

410
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,097
<i>I think a western film
approaching the east</i>

411
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,100
<i>can be guilty
of what's called "exoticism."</i>

412
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,893
The tendency to take

413
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,646
<i>a western view of the east,</i>

414
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,441
<i>and commercialize it for consumption.</i>

415
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,486
<i>I tried very hard to stay away
from that tendency</i>

416
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:53,493
<i>and tried very hard to see it clearly
through the perspective of a visitor.</i>

417
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:58,665
<i>Benedict had been there before
in the past, but I shot it in such a way</i>

418
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:03,170
<i>that it felt the way that it felt to me
when I first visited,</i>

419
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:07,591
<i>which was beautiful
and overwhelming and unique.</i>

420
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,178
<i>This is obviously
a set built in London</i>

421
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,346
<i>by our production designer,
Charlie Wood.</i>

422
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>The detail in here is extraordinary.</i>

423
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:19,728
<i>He is in a league of his own
in terms of production design.</i>

424
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:24,191
<i>And here we have the introduction
of Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One.</i>

425
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:30,989
<i>Probably the most
controversial casting choice</i>

426
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,034
<i>I've ever been involved with in a movie.</i>

427
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,245
<i>A bit unfortunate, I think.</i>

428
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,833
<i>A bit of it is due
to the timing of our movie.</i>

429
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,919
<i>Our first trailer came out,</i>

430
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:47,797
<i>and there was no problem
anybody had</i>

431
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,968
<i>with the Ancient One
being played by Tilda Swinton.</i>

432
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:56,097
<i>There is a lot of talk
about the term "whitewashing,"</i>

433
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,726
<i>which I don't know really applies here
for two reasons.</i>

434
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:06,024
<i>One, the Ancient One
is not always Asian in the comics.</i>

435
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,277
<i>The Sorcerer Supreme is
a title that is handed down,</i>

436
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,738
<i>and there were different iterations
of it in the comics.</i>

437
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,782
<i>But more significantly,</i>

438
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:19,120
<i>that's a term that strongly implies
or declares a racist intention.</i>

439
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,081
<i>And I certainly didn't have that.</i>

440
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,168
<i>I felt really tortured</i>

441
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:29,631
<i>by the decision of who to cast
in this role.</i>

442
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:35,637
<i>Because I was up against,
what felt like and still feels like,</i>

443
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,806
<i>a bit of a no-win situation.</i>

444
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,268
<i>I had two characters in the comics.</i>

445
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:45,772
<i>Wong and the Ancient One, who were
both pretty bad racial stereotypes.</i>

446
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:51,820
<i>And I thought Wong was
the more offensive one,</i>

447
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:55,115
<i>being a sidekick, kung fu manservant.</i>

448
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,826
<i>I didn't really know
what to do with that character.</i>

449
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,287
<i>I was thinking maybe we just
wouldn't have him in the movie.</i>

450
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,624
<i>He wasn't instrumental to
the origin story of Doctor Strange,</i>

451
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,294
<i>and we could leave him out
like we left Clea out,</i>

452
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,212
<i>and some of
the other major characters.</i>

453
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,506
<i>But the Ancient One,</i>

454
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,303
<i>it was not an option
to leave the Ancient One out</i>

455
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,095
<i>because there's no story
without him meeting her here,</i>

456
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,805
<i>or meeting the Ancient One here.</i>

457
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,474
<i>And I knew that I had to get away</i>

458
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,604
<i>from the stereotypical
western view of Asians</i>

459
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,315
<i>that was a stereotype perpetrated</i>

460
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,484
<i>by the Fu Manchu-wearing
magical Asian on the hill,</i>

461
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:35,155
<i>who becomes a magical,
mystical mentor to the white hero.</i>

462
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,366
<i>And so, my first decision
was to cast a woman.</i>

463
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,494
<i>And I wanted a woman,
not just any woman.</i>

464
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,496
<i>I wanted a woman Tilda's age.</i>

465
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:51,212
<i>A woman who wasn't a 26-year-old,
leather-clad, fanboy dream girl,</i>

466
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:54,716
<i>but had some maturity
and interest and intrigue.</i>

467
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,801
<i>And we talked about Asian actresses.</i>

468
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,138
<i>But as I worked on the scripts,</i>

469
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:04,684
<i>I will confess,
I simply could not find a way</i>

470
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:08,605
<i>to avoid having this character
be what she is.</i>

471
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:13,276
<i>A magical, mystical, martial arts mentor</i>

472
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,363
<i>with some hidden motives and secrets,</i>

473
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,864
<i>and domineering.</i>

474
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,533
<i>And everything I just described
in a woman,</i>

475
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:23,078
<i>if that woman is Asian,
it's a dragon lady.</i>

476
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:27,832
<i>And I spoke with numerous
Asian-American friends,</i>

477
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,667
<i>Asian-American film critics,</i>

478
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:34,005
<i>and they agreed
that I was probably best off</i>

479
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:37,050
<i>not perpetrating
that dragon lady stereotype</i>

480
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:42,180
<i>that we saw in past movies
going back to Anna May Wong</i>

481
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,183
<i>and a stereotype perpetrated</i>

482
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,352
<i>throughout movie
and television history.</i>

483
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,354
<i>And so, I looked for an actress</i>

484
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,690
<i>who could embody what was great
about the Ancient One,</i>

485
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,360
<i>this intrigue
and this mysterious quality.</i>

486
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,904
<i>And Tilda seemed perfect,
and when I thought of her,</i>

487
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:01,616
<i>I was able to write the role
in a unique and fresh way.</i>

488
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,411
<i>And I think she did an amazing job.</i>

489
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:10,792
<i>Now, here is the beginning
of the psychedelia of the movie.</i>

490
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:15,088
<i>And I loved the idea of Doctor Strange</i>

491
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:20,760
<i>really being thrown into
the world of mystery,</i>

492
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:27,100
<i>mysticism, magic, and psychedelia
in a most mind-bending fashion,</i>

493
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,728
<i>and a shock to the system
because he is so narcissistic,</i>

494
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,522
<i>and so self-absorbed,</i>

495
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,442
<i>that the only way
he's gonna be reached</i>

496
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:40,113
<i>is for his skeptical, materialistic,</i>

497
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:43,324
<i>materialist, narrow-minded
view of the world</i>

498
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:47,120
<i>was gonna have to be
snapped like a spell.</i>

499
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:51,124
<i>And the Ancient One understands that,
so she sends him on this mind trip.</i>

500
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:56,921
<i>And this is at the heart
of</i> Doctor Strange, <i>the comic, I think.</i>

501
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,798
<i>These kind of mind-bending visuals</i>

502
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:02,135
<i>and this kind of psychedelic aesthetic,</i>

503
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,596
<i>where you've got characters
in environments</i>

504
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,473
<i>that you haven't seen before.</i>

505
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,142
<i>This, so far, right here,
this little section,</i>

506
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,228
<i>is probably the one
that's been most commented on</i>

507
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,439
<i>by people I do know
have seen the movie.</i>

508
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,942
<i>That this is a little bit
of the horror director coming out,</i>

509
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,028
<i>this bit with the hands.</i>

510
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:24,449
<i>For people who don't watch horror,
it's pretty horrific, I guess.</i>

511
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,826
<i>So, I got a touch of it in here.</i>

512
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,831
<i>This image here, obviously, is a nod
to</i> Ant-Man <i>and the Quantum Realm,</i>

513
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:38,046
<i>acknowledging that as one of
the mysterious realms of existence.</i>

514
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,131
<i>And this is straight
Steve Ditko right here.</i>

515
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,258
<i>That's like right out of the comic books.</i>

516
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:47,263
<i>That's right off
of my 1971 black light poster,</i>

517
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,099
<i>which I think was Jack Kirby,
if I'm not mistaken.</i>

518
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,687
<i>And the first hint of Dormammu,
our villain.</i>

519
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:59,859
<i>Now, this next line is one of the most
important lines in the movie.</i>

520
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:03,530
<i>"Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?"</i>

521
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,699
<i>And here's a guy
who's been stripped of his identity,</i>

522
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:11,788
<i>has nothing in his heart but anger</i>

523
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,290
<i>that his identity
has been taken from him,</i>

524
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:19,045
<i>and his money,
and his ego is so bruised.</i>

525
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:22,048
<i>And she breaks him down
and asks him that question,</i>

526
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:25,927
<i>and he is humbled by it.</i>

527
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,762
<i>Which I think is very realistic.</i>

528
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,098
<i>I think if you actually
had that experience,</i>

529
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:33,393
<i>and knew that you had just
encountered something that was real,</i>

530
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,522
<i>you would want to be taught
by this person.</i>

531
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,316
<i>You would want to know
what she knows.</i>

532
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,988
<i>And she throws him out,
which I think is great.</i>

533
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:50,451
<i>And we come to find out that
she's nervous about Kaecilius.</i>

534
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,956
<i>She's nervous that this guy hasn't...</i>

535
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,539
<i>She can sense that he's adept,</i>

536
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,083
<i>that he could probably
become a great sorcerer,</i>

537
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:02,672
<i>that he has what it takes
and has a mindset that is unique.</i>

538
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,593
<i>Which is why Mordo
brought him into Kamar-Taj,</i>

539
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,344
<i>because he sensed the same thing.</i>

540
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,932
<i>But she does not want to make
the same mistake</i>

541
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,685
<i>that she made with Kaecilius.</i>

542
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:20,106
<i>And here begins
the kind of family drama of the movie.</i>

543
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,317
<i>I always thought of the movie...</i>

544
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,402
<i>Not always.
It was really more of a discovery.</i>

545
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:29,949
<i>But I came to think of the movie as this
mother figure and her three sons.</i>

546
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,535
<i>She's got the good son in Mordo,</i>

547
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,289
<i>she's got the bad, wayward son
in Kaecilius,</i>

548
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,375
<i>and then she's got this new son
in Strange.</i>

549
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,795
<i>And that part of her motive
in letting him in,</i>

550
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:47,300
<i>and I think part of Mordo's motive
in bringing Strange in,</i>

551
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,845
<i>is a search for redemption
on their own part</i>

552
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,972
<i>of wanting to find somebody
who they know</i>

553
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,433
<i>has the capacity that Strange has,</i>

554
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,353
<i>as Kaecilius did, and to do it right,</i>

555
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,856
<i>and to make up for that mistake.</i>

556
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:05,485
<i>And Mordo and his sense of justice,
and his sense of balance,</i>

557
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:09,822
<i>and his sense of things
being made right,</i>

558
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,199
<i>and the rules being kept,</i>

559
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:15,536
<i>I think he feels that there's an absence
in Kamar-Taj that needs to be filled.</i>

560
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,916
<i>And it's one of the reasons he
advocates Strange being brought in.</i>

561
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,712
<i>This next bit leads up
to the Wi-Fi password joke,</i>

562
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,006
<i>which is probably
the biggest laugh in the movie,</i>

563
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,010
<i>at least at the screenings
that I attended and the test screenings.</i>

564
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:35,348
<i>And it's because
we're taking the piss out of it,</i>

565
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,517
<i>as we say here, occasionally.</i>

566
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:43,147
<i>We're setting up this very magical
place and it all feels very serious,</i>

567
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:46,484
<i>and "shamballa"
looks like a serious word.</i>

568
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>And then he's like,
"It's a Wi-Fi password."</i>

569
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,366
<i>We're not beyond technology here.
We're not below technology, either.</i>

570
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:57,286
<i>This is still a real place
in the real modern world.</i>

571
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,207
<i>I want to talk a little bit
about Benedict</i>

572
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,919
<i>as we move into
this training sequence.</i>

573
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,590
<i>I've said it in a lot of interviews,</i>

574
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:13,136
<i>but those of you listening
may not have ever heard about this.</i>

575
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,473
<i>He was absolutely
my first choice for the movie,</i>

576
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,062
<i>and Marvel's first choice for the movie.</i>

577
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,563
<i>We talked about who should play him.</i>

578
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,104
<i>We concluded that it should be
Benedict Cumberbatch,</i>

579
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:30,236
<i>and we decided to meet with him
and offer him the movie.</i>

580
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,072
<i>I flew to London.
Talked him through the whole movie.</i>

581
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,410
<i>We didn't even have a script
at that point.</i>

582
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,617
<i>And he wanted to do it.
He was game for doing it.</i>

583
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,036
<i>He understood
what we were trying to make.</i>

584
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,499
<i>But he was unavailable because
he was doing</i> Hamlet <i>in the summer.</i>

585
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,085
<i>And we were not gonna be
able to finish the movie</i>

586
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,004
<i>in time for our summer release date.</i>

587
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:51,424
<i>So, I went and met with a lot of
other actors, and good actors,</i>

588
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:58,139
<i>and I just did not feel that anyone was
the right actor for Stephen Strange,</i>

589
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:02,477
<i>and so, I went back to Kevin and said,
"It's gotta be Benedict," and he agreed.</i>

590
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,147
<i>And to his credit, he pushed
the release date for an actor,</i>

591
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,358
<i>which is an expensive thing to do</i>

592
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,486
<i>'cause we were already
in pre-production,</i>

593
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,116
<i>but it was certainly the right thing to do</i>

594
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:18,868
<i>because he does have qualities
that are so uniquely Doctor Strange.</i>

595
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,621
<i>I certainly can't picture
anybody else doing it at this point.</i>

596
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:29,003
<i>And I think that the qualities
specifically are high intelligence,</i>

597
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:33,132
<i>high education, enough
to believe him as a neurosurgeon.</i>

598
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,968
<i>He certainly carries himself</i>

599
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:40,807
<i>with enough sophistication
and experience</i>

600
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,479
<i>to believe that he's part
of New York elite high society,</i>

601
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:50,274
<i>and an expert at something
as difficult as brain surgery.</i>

602
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,403
<i>But he's also got incredible depth
of emotional range</i>

603
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,244
<i>and tremendous depth of emotion
and incredible range of emotion</i>

604
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,498
<i>that he can access at any time.</i>

605
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,789
<i>And Doctor Strange
goes through so much in this movie.</i>

606
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>He goes through so many
emotional iterations,</i>

607
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:11,045
<i>that I just needed Benedict
to be able to play all of them.</i>

608
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,882
<i>Like this scene right here,
I love this scene,</i>

609
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,802
<i>and it's another scene
that usually gets a good laugh.</i>

610
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,679
<i>And I think it gets a laugh because...</i>

611
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,682
<i>Well, it is funny
and it's Benedict's comedic timing,</i>

612
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:23,808
<i>but he's humble.</i>

613
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:27,186
<i>We see a humility here
and in the previous scene</i>

614
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,106
<i>that is the result of him being broken
by the Ancient One.</i>

615
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,191
<i>And I really love that because, again,</i>

616
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,945
<i>that's what trauma and pain
and suffering do.</i>

617
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,531
<i>They humble you
and they break you down.</i>

618
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,201
<i>And eventually,
they force you to reckon with things</i>

619
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,203
<i>you otherwise
would never reckon with.</i>

620
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:47,123
<i>And all of us have it.</i>

621
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:52,879
<i>All of us in this life endure trauma
at some point and to some degree.</i>

622
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:57,300
<i>All of us have to deal with our own
kinds of pain and suffering.</i>

623
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,718
<i>No one is without it.</i>

624
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:03,139
<i>Some people have much worse trauma
and pain and suffering than others.</i>

625
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:08,394
<i>But every one of us has to learn
how we're going to respond to it.</i>

626
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:14,483
<i>And I've just become
a big believer that</i>

627
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,194
<i>you don't want it,
you don't wish it on anybody,</i>

628
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:21,574
<i>but when it's in your life, when you
experience something traumatic,</i>

629
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:25,620
<i>or any kind of personal pain
or suffering, don't waste it, you know?</i>

630
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:29,415
<i>Let it transform you
into something better than you are.</i>

631
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:31,751
<i>Because it will force you
to reckon with yourself</i>

632
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,252
<i>in ways you otherwise wouldn't.</i>

633
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:37,340
<i>And it's one of
the deeper explorations of this movie.</i>

634
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:41,469
<i>I didn't set out to try to say that.</i>

635
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:44,931
<i>I didn't really set out to try
to say anything with this movie.</i>

636
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,600
<i>I took a very different approach
to this movie</i>

637
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,394
<i>than any film I've done before.</i>

638
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:56,275
<i>I set out to explore things and to listen
to what the movie had to teach me.</i>

639
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:01,489
<i>And I read a lot of books,
and listened to a lot of people,</i>

640
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,450
<i>and thought a lot about different things.</i>

641
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,952
<i>And some of the themes,</i>

642
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:09,538
<i>and some of the mysticism,
some of the ideas,</i>

643
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,794
<i>some of the basic truths about
human life that come out in this movie</i>

644
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:19,882
<i>weren't necessarily things
that I thought about much</i>

645
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,300
<i>prior to making this movie.</i>

646
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:24,887
<i>They were the result of relationships
I was in while I was making it,</i>

647
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,556
<i>people I knew while I was making it,</i>

648
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,558
<i>books I was reading
while I was making it.</i>

649
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:33,688
<i>All a deliberate search for more truth
and meaning in my own life,</i>

650
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:38,985
<i>and trying to translate that into
some kind of good creative story</i>

651
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,404
<i>that's a Marvel movie.</i>

652
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:46,367
<i>And here we have Mads Mikkelsen,
the great Mads Mikkelsen.</i>

653
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,202
<i>What can I say about Mads?</i>

654
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:52,707
<i>He is one of the most positive actors
I've ever worked with.</i>

655
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,043
<i>Just constantly, perpetually positive
in the best way.</i>

656
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,546
<i>So fun to work with and very focused.</i>

657
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,256
<i>Always focused on the work.</i>

658
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,009
<i>He's usually not standing around,
talking about this or that.</i>

659
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,886
<i>He's usually pacing,
thinking about the scene.</i>

660
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,806
<i>And he was like a kid in a candy shop
on this movie</i>

661
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:12,018
<i>because he always wanted to be
in a kung fu movie.</i>

662
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,438
<i>When I first talked to him
about the role,</i>

663
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:21,318
<i>I was telling him about his motivation,
and he's this disenfranchised sorcerer,</i>

664
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:27,533
<i>and he's obsessed with eternal life
and death and betrayal</i>

665
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,953
<i>and the hypocrisy of the Ancient One,
and he was very interested in all that.</i>

666
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:34,498
<i>But then when I told him he was gonna
have to train for the fight scenes,</i>

667
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,126
<i>he said, "You mean I get to fight
like a kung fu movie?"</i>

668
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,382
<i>I said, "Well, yeah. A lot of it.
There's a lot of fighting."</i>

669
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,592
<i>He said, "Oh, that's all you had to say.
I'm in. I'll do it."</i>

670
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,386
<i>Like,
he said that right on the phone,</i>

671
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,051
<i>and I thought that was so fantastic.</i>

672
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,374
<i>I told him, I said,
"I think I should hang up right now."</i>

673
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,641
<i>More of the kind of fractal,
weird,</i>

674
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,643
<i>matter manipulation
in the church there.</i>

675
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:58,481
<i>That was one of the first images
that we experimented with</i>

676
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,900
<i>in our visual effects design,</i>

677
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,943
<i>how to move matter around.</i>

678
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:06,781
<i>And it worked so well,
we built more of the story around it</i>

679
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:12,119
<i>and made that a really special power
that Strange had.</i>

680
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:15,247
<i>Now, this section of the movie,
this training section,</i>

681
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,084
<i>is longer than I expected it to be.</i>

682
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>I didn't think
that I was gonna make a long movie</i>

683
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:31,097
<i>because I tend to gravitate toward
simple plots with complex characters,</i>

684
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,681
<i>because I think most bad movies</i>

685
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,434
<i>are complex plots
with simple characters.</i>

686
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,936
<i>And we've all seen those,</i>

687
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,105
<i>and we all know how long
they can feel.</i>

688
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,149
<i>But a relatively simple story,
which this is,</i>

689
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,027
<i>with complicated characters,
is very engaging.</i>

690
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:51,659
<i>And so, I was relying
on the characters and that drama</i>

691
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:55,704
<i>and Strange's growth and origin
to make the movie interesting,</i>

692
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:57,623
<i>and the visual effects sequences,</i>

693
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,042
<i>the big event sequences
as well, of course.</i>

694
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,546
<i>But the audience, when we tested
the movie, just wanted more training.</i>

695
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:06,632
<i>They just wanted more
than I had initially shot.</i>

696
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:07,803
<i>So, we shot some more of this</i>

697
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,302
<i>and added it to the movie
because they just loved it.</i>

698
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,805
<i>I love that
Hamir character, by the way.</i>

699
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,057
<i>We set him up deliberately
at the beginning</i>

700
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,935
<i>as kind of a nod to the stereotype</i>

701
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:21,564
<i>or the cliché
that we were trying to avoid,</i>

702
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,233
<i>and that Strange himself falls prey to.</i>

703
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:28,028
<i>He walks in and sees
the old Asian man with the beard,</i>

704
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,489
<i>and assumes,
"Oh, that's the Ancient One."</i>

705
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,575
<i>And it's not,
it's actually this bald woman.</i>

706
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:37,663
<i>And then when he does have
a moment in the movie,</i>

707
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,373
<i>we know that he's a master sorcerer,</i>

708
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,836
<i>and when we have a moment
in the movie,</i>

709
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,460
<i>we find out that he has a disability.</i>

710
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:48,632
<i>And I'm not talking about
how progressive my movie is.</i>

711
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:52,553
<i>But I am saying that diversity
is the responsibility of directors.</i>

712
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:57,349
<i>And directors gotta take
responsibility for diversity,</i>

713
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,351
<i>and do the best that they can.</i>

714
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:06,150
<i>I don't know that I could've done
a better job on this movie with diversity.</i>

715
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,568
<i>But I'll say one more thing,</i>

716
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:10,863
<i>just going back to seeing Tilda there,
and addressing this subject.</i>

717
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,825
<i>I will say that the movie, I'm sure,
even after its release,</i>

718
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:15,951
<i>will still have critics</i>

719
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:20,915
<i>for whitewashing the role
of the Ancient One and casting Tilda.</i>

720
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:24,210
<i>And I don't fault anybody
for being critical of that.</i>

721
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,755
<i>I think it's really important
that activists,</i>

722
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:31,467
<i>Asian-American activists,
continue to be loud and angry</i>

723
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,844
<i>about the subject of whitewashing,</i>

724
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,640
<i>about the subject of the erasure
of Asian roles, about stereotyping.</i>

725
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:45,564
<i>And they have to be loud and angry
and dogged and relentless</i>

726
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,858
<i>because otherwise
no one will listen to them.</i>

727
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:51,278
<i>And representation
of Asian-Americans</i>

728
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:54,406
<i>throughout Hollywood cinema
is abysmal.</i>

729
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,159
<i>It's so bad
and always has been bad.</i>

730
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,744
<i>At least if you're African-American,</i>

731
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:03,666
<i>you've had some movie stars
over the last 30 years to relate to.</i>

732
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:07,002
<i>Will Smith and Denzel
and Eddie Murphy in the '80s.</i>

733
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,588
<i>And if you're Asian-American,</i>

734
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,341
<i>you're as American as me
if you grew up here.</i>

735
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:16,011
<i>And you're racially 5%
of the US population,</i>

736
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,516
<i>but you sure don't get 5%
of the movie stars.</i>

737
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:24,353
<i>So, it's something
that's gonna have to change,</i>

738
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,773
<i>and it was an issue
I took very seriously in this movie.</i>

739
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:33,028
<i>Which is why after making
the decision to cast Tilda,</i>

740
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:36,615
<i>because I really felt
that was best for the movie</i>

741
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:39,118
<i>and for the issue of diversity,</i>

742
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,830
<i>it was my best shot at making
the right choice there.</i>

743
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,748
<i>Whether you agree with it or not,</i>

744
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,626
<i>I certainly did it
with the best possible motives.</i>

745
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,212
<i>But because I was losing
what could've been</i>

746
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,672
<i>an Asian role in the movie,</i>

747
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,467
<i>I made this character, Wong,
a major character.</i>

748
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,845
<i>I didn't just bring him
into the movie,</i>

749
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,681
<i>but I made sure
that he was substantial.</i>

750
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:06,103
<i>And the trick was to,
essentially, invert him from the comics.</i>

751
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,356
<i>Instead of a man servant,
he's a librarian.</i>

752
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,319
<i>Instead of a sidekick,
he's Strange's intellectual mentor.</i>

753
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:18,824
<i>Instead of him being somebody</i>

754
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:23,162
<i>who takes care of Strange
inside of Kamar-Taj,</i>

755
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,997
<i>he's a master of the Mystic Arts.</i>

756
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,251
<i>And Strange and he
have this great relationship</i>

757
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:30,753
<i>that develops through the movie</i>

758
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:36,342
<i>because Wong is as hard on him
or harder than even the Ancient One,</i>

759
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,094
<i>and is instrumental to his growth.</i>

760
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:44,099
<i>And I love that at the end of the movie,
it's the two of them together.</i>

761
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:49,563
<i>They're the two survivors
of this whole drama within Kamar-Taj.</i>

762
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:52,524
<i>Kaecilius is taken
into the Dark Dimension,</i>

763
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:57,404
<i>the Ancient One has been killed,
and Mordo has left.</i>

764
00:44:57,488 --> 00:44:59,031
<i>And by the end tag of the movie,</i>

765
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:02,785
<i>we know that he is heading off
to the dark side in a bad way,</i>

766
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,162
<i>and it's just Wong and Strange left.</i>

767
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,663
<i>And Wong is still his master.</i>

768
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,541
<i>Wong is still schooling him</i>

769
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:14,254
<i>about how little he really knows.</i>

770
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,633
<i>This Mirror Dimension idea</i>

771
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:23,389
<i>was an idea based on a desire</i>

772
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:29,019
<i>to create a kind of magic
that the audience hadn't seen before.</i>

773
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:31,021
<i>The manipulation of matter</i>

774
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:34,608
<i>in a dimension
that's ever-present but invisible.</i>

775
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,610
<i>A mirrored reflection of our reality.</i>

776
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,737
<i>I like this idea quite a bit</i>

777
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:43,409
<i>and I like how it's visually represented
with these shards,</i>

778
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:47,746
<i>and this manipulation of matter,
which we see</i>

779
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,667
<i>all through what we call the Mirror
Dimension chase that comes later on.</i>

780
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:58,215
<i>This was a starting point for me
in making</i> Doctor Strange.

781
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:03,429
<i>Wanting to have visual set-pieces
that were brand new</i>

782
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:06,432
<i>and not like
other things we've seen before.</i>

783
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:09,685
<i>I remember saying to Kevin,
when I was meeting with him,</i>

784
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:15,357
<i>that every major visual effects
sequence in</i> Doctor Strange

785
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:20,737
<i>should feel like the weirdest scene
in any other movie.</i>

786
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:24,700
<i>And if all of our scenes would be
the weirdest scene in any other movie,</i>

787
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:28,454
<i>then we have something worthy
of the comic book title</i> Doctor Strange.

788
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:33,417
<i>And the Mirror Dimension was set up.</i>

789
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,169
<i>We just showed the astral plane</i>

790
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:38,714
<i>that was set up by seeing
Strange studying there</i>

791
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:40,674
<i>and what we call the astral push,</i>

792
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,010
<i>when she knocked him out of his body.</i>

793
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,804
<i>Here, we're getting backstory
on Kaecilius,</i>

794
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:50,601
<i>and how he stole the ritual in
the opening scene, and why he stole it.</i>

795
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:56,148
<i>All of these, including
the upcoming scene with the apple,</i>

796
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,067
<i>are serving two purposes.</i>

797
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:00,194
<i>Well, three purposes.</i>

798
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,446
<i>Number one,
they're entertaining in their own right,</i>

799
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,907
<i>because this is
a new world we're introducing,</i>

800
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,200
<i>this world of magic.</i>

801
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:09,077
<i>Number two,
they're showing Strange's growth.</i>

802
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:12,789
<i>His arrogance is starting
to return a little bit</i>

803
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,334
<i>and his confidence is starting to return</i>

804
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:18,587
<i>as he becomes better
at the Mystic Arts.</i>

805
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,298
<i>But probably more than anything,</i>

806
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,634
<i>we're setting up
the second half of the movie.</i>

807
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:25,093
<i>Because in a movie about magic,</i>

808
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:28,305
<i>you've got to understand
a little bit of how it works.</i>

809
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:31,225
<i>I'm a big believer
in not explaining away magic,</i>

810
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:34,686
<i>not giving magic
too much of a scientific explanation,</i>

811
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,022
<i>because if it has too much
of a scientific explanation,</i>

812
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,732
<i>it's not magic anymore.</i>

813
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:44,279
<i>Magic, by definition, is ineffable
and beyond our understanding.</i>

814
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,949
<i>It's channeling something mysterious,</i>

815
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,245
<i>something bigger than ourselves,</i>

816
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,993
<i>something more powerful
than ourselves.</i>

817
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:51,662
<i>And that's what makes it fun.</i>

818
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:56,416
<i>The whole idea of spells,
incantations, and all of that</i>

819
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,380
<i>is about the use of power
bigger than ourselves.</i>

820
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,258
<i>And this whole section of the movie,</i>

821
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:07,970
<i>this training section,
is both showing Strange growing,</i>

822
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,472
<i>and we learn how he became able</i>

823
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:12,186
<i>to do the things he does
in the second half.</i>

824
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:15,269
<i>But we're also setting up
the world of magic.</i>

825
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,397
<i>Mordo's Vaulting Boots.
We just set those up.</i>

826
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,233
<i>We just set up Strange's whip,</i>

827
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:24,403
<i>and where it came from
and how he uses it,</i>

828
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,905
<i>and why he uses it
the way that he uses it.</i>

829
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:30,200
<i>And the trick is to do all of that</i>

830
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:33,161
<i>in a way that feels fluid and seamless
and keeps you engaged.</i>

831
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,247
<i>And that, hopefully, is the case here</i>

832
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,583
<i>because we're with Strange
as a character.</i>

833
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,226
<i>We're watching him transform
and change.</i>

834
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:40,711
<i>We're watching him grow.</i>

835
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:46,425
<i>Even though we're not even
halfway through the movie,</i>

836
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,387
<i>he's already a different guy
than he used to be.</i>

837
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,600
<i>Tagging the word "time" there
after he looks at the watch,</i>

838
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:57,311
<i>obviously a major theme
throughout the movie.</i>

839
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:58,645
<i>Time.</i>

840
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:05,360
<i>And I think trauma and time, healing,</i>

841
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:09,364
<i>these are all thematic things
that are dealt with</i>

842
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,450
<i>recurrently throughout the movie.</i>

843
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,039
<i>But again, I don't believe in reducing
a movie to a simple theme</i>

844
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:21,335
<i>or a simple idea or a series of ideas,</i>

845
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:23,545
<i>because if you could just say
what the movie's about,</i>

846
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:27,633
<i>and if you could just say all of
what makes it significant,</i>

847
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:29,426
<i>you wouldn't need to make the movie.</i>

848
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,513
<i>Flannery O'Connor said, "If you can
easily state the theme of a movie..."</i>

849
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:36,391
<i>I'm sorry. "If you can easily state
the theme of a story,</i>

850
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:38,143
<i>"you can be sure it's not a good one."</i>

851
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:41,772
<i>So, at least on this movie,</i>

852
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:45,400
<i>I've resisted trying to hit
any particular theme hard.</i>

853
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,944
<i>I just let themes and ideas emerge</i>

854
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:51,406
<i>in the storytelling while I was writing.</i>

855
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:57,621
<i>And it certainly deals in subjects
that matter to me</i>

856
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:01,249
<i>and I think are integral to the character.</i>

857
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,338
<i>This scene turned out pretty good,
I think.</i>

858
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,674
<i>I really love this moment of the apple</i>

859
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,593
<i>moving because it's such a small thing.</i>

860
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:14,680
<i>I needed to have an example of magic</i>

861
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:18,517
<i>to help usher the audience
into real experiences</i>

862
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,811
<i>in real time of how magic works.</i>

863
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:23,647
<i>And my first idea
was to do it with gestures</i>

864
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,607
<i>rather than spoken spells.</i>

865
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,235
<i>And in this case,
it's the manipulation of time</i>

866
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,280
<i>using the Infinity Stone
around his neck,</i>

867
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,991
<i>what we'll find out is an Infinity Stone.</i>

868
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,618
<i>But I like this manipulation,</i>

869
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:39,663
<i>just the cinematic quality
of this camera move,</i>

870
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,207
<i>moving with Strange's gesture.</i>

871
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,876
<i>And it goes from left to right,</i>

872
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,837
<i>and then from right to left
like a timeline.</i>

873
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:49,426
<i>If you ever drew
a timeline on a board,</i>

874
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:53,176
<i>it moves forward, from left to right,
and backwards from right to left.</i>

875
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,555
<i>And so, I think, intuitively,
with a single shot,</i>

876
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,933
<i>the feeling of that apple moving
through time feels effortless.</i>

877
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:04,062
<i>And those kind of things
are surprisingly hard to achieve.</i>

878
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:08,400
<i>They look simple when they're done,
but getting that right was not easy.</i>

879
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:13,155
<i>I'll say a word here
about our visual effects vendors.</i>

880
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:16,575
<i>Looking at some of these shots,
that was a particularly tricky one.</i>

881
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:20,328
<i>Sometimes the shots that you think
are gonna be really hard are very easy.</i>

882
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,652
<i>And some shots you think
will be very easy are very hard.</i>

883
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:31,506
<i>But ILM, I think, was
the biggest vendor on this movie.</i>

884
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:35,427
<i>Luma did the Dark Dimension.</i>

885
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:40,015
<i>Framestore did
a big section of the movie.</i>

886
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,143
<i>Method did
a big section of the movie.</i>

887
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,773
<i>And there's other vendors
that I'm leaving out.</i>

888
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:46,646
<i>And lots of smaller vendors.</i>

889
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,857
<i>And we have so many vendors
on the movie,</i>

890
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,442
<i>not just because the movie's so big,</i>

891
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,278
<i>but because we had
a short post-production schedule.</i>

892
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,781
<i>And because we moved the movie
for Benedict,</i>

893
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:58,867
<i>we didn't have as much time for post
as we needed.</i>

894
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>And so, we had a lot more
visual effects people</i>

895
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:02,874
<i>working on this movie than normal,</i>

896
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:04,915
<i>because we had to get it done
so quickly.</i>

897
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:08,460
<i>And I think that all of the vendors
did a really good job.</i>

898
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,921
<i>I'm quite satisfied
with the visual effects in this movie.</i>

899
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:13,089
<i>I think that they worked pretty well.</i>

900
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:19,054
<i>Visual effects are
obviously critical to this movie,</i>

901
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:22,140
<i>and they're critical
to any big budget movie of this size.</i>

902
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:24,810
<i>But as George Lucas once said,</i>

903
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,645
<i>"The best visual effect in the world,"</i>

904
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:30,065
<i>"if it doesn't contribute to the story
or to the character, is boring."</i>

905
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,192
<i>And I've always remembered him
saying that.</i>

906
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:34,569
<i>I ascribe to the exact same philosophy.</i>

907
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:36,571
<i>And in this movie,</i>

908
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:41,743
<i>as much of a unique attempt
as we were making,</i>

909
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:44,830
<i>trying to create some spellbinding
images and some new things,</i>

910
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,249
<i>I was also trying to
write those sequences</i>

911
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,502
<i>in a way that was
connected to the story</i>

912
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:53,088
<i>and more specifically,
connected to the character.</i>

913
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:59,845
<i>This scene here
is surprisingly watchable for me.</i>

914
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:03,014
<i>Again, I can't speak
for an audience at this point,</i>

915
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:06,601
<i>but it's surprisingly watchable,
even though it's straight exposition.</i>

916
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:09,813
<i>And it's exposition that's interesting</i>

917
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,190
<i>because it's unique
and it is storytelling.</i>

918
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,234
<i>We're getting a backstory of a place.</i>

919
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:18,864
<i>Kamar-Taj and these Sanctums
and Agamotto,</i>

920
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:21,867
<i>and where the Eye of Agamotto
came from,</i>

921
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,285
<i>where that name came from.</i>

922
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,079
<i>And most significantly,</i>

923
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:28,290
<i>it's watchable because of
Benedict Wong.</i>

924
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:31,376
<i>I think that guy could read
the phone book,</i>

925
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:35,338
<i>and I would be compelled.</i>

926
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,552
<i>Boy, I just dated myself
by referencing the phone book.</i>

927
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,009
<i>Do they even have those anymore?</i>

928
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,970
<i>But he is an actor who</i>

929
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,849
<i>consistently makes things interesting.</i>

930
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:47,893
<i>He can take any bit of dialogue</i>

931
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:51,313
<i>and give it gravity and weight
and make it compelling.</i>

932
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,689
<i>He's so good.</i>

933
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:56,776
<i>And I was just unbelievably fortunate</i>

934
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:01,281
<i>to have the caliber of actors
in this movie that I do.</i>

935
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,116
<i>And not only the caliber of actors,</i>

936
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,160
<i>but the caliber of human beings
that they were.</i>

937
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:10,415
<i>Benedict, Tilda, Rachel,
Benedict Wong, Chiwetel,</i>

938
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:14,419
<i>all of them are spectacular actors.</i>

939
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,380
<i>Like, five-star actors.
As good as they get.</i>

940
00:54:17,464 --> 00:54:18,802
<i>They loved working with each other.</i>

941
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,675
<i>They all worked really well together,</i>

942
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,802
<i>and they are all
tremendous human beings.</i>

943
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:26,640
<i>And I'm not just saying that.
We all really loved working together.</i>

944
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:30,602
<i>And they're all really unique, too.</i>

945
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:37,525
<i>Chiwetel is probably the person
I spoke to the most on set.</i>

946
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,904
<i>Mads is great, too,
but I already gave him some props.</i>

947
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,698
<i>But Chiwetel was probably the person
I spoke to the most on set,</i>

948
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:46,326
<i>just because he knows everything.</i>

949
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:51,539
<i>He is one of the most educated people
you will ever meet.</i>

950
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:54,292
<i>And, when it comes to history,</i>

951
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:59,547
<i>he might be the most educated person
I know when it comes to history.</i>

952
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:02,425
<i>He knows history so incredibly well.</i>

953
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:06,137
<i>He was a history student in school.</i>

954
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:09,975
<i>I think he has a master's
in some kind of historical study.</i>

955
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,184
<i>But you can bring up</i>

956
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:15,730
<i>almost any socioeconomic,
political, historical subject,</i>

957
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:19,526
<i>and he will have
incredible insights into it.</i>

958
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,653
<i>And he speaks perfect paragraphs.</i>

959
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:22,821
<i>He's very eloquent.</i>

960
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:28,284
<i>And I learned a lot from him
just by general conversation.</i>

961
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:32,789
<i>Because he was always surprising me
with his knowledge of things.</i>

962
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:38,336
<i>And it's so odd that a guy
that is that intellectually driven...</i>

963
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,256
<i>I mean,
he still reads history voraciously.</i>

964
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:46,761
<i>That a guy like that
is so emotional on camera.</i>

965
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:51,558
<i>That he is so brainy and so emotional
at the same time,</i>

966
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:56,521
<i>and he can get so much
depth of nuance</i>

967
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:58,857
<i>out of any moment.</i>

968
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,026
<i>He's a very specific actor.</i>

969
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:07,365
<i>I made the mistake of watching</i>
12 Years a Slave <i>the day I met him.</i>

970
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,533
<i>I hadn't seen it.</i>

971
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,372
<i>It had won the Academy Award
for Best Picture.</i>

972
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,162
<i>And I still hadn't seen it,</i>

973
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,040
<i>mainly because I was working
on this movie.</i>

974
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:18,960
<i>And stupidly, I watched it the morning
that I was meeting with him,</i>

975
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:22,130
<i>and I knew how much I loved him
as an actor from previous work.</i>

976
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:25,675
<i>I wanted to hire him based on
things I had seen him do before.</i>

977
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:28,553
<i>I'd been a fan of his
since</i> Dirty Pretty Things.

978
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,890
<i>But I watched that movie and...</i>

979
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:35,852
<i>And he came in
and I just couldn't speak.</i>

980
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:39,022
<i>I couldn't speak without talking about</i>
12 Years A Slave.

981
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:42,317
<i>I felt like it was one of the most
important movies I'd ever seen,</i>

982
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,694
<i>and I was so emotionally affected by it,</i>

983
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:48,823
<i>and I kept apologizing to him
because I was shaken by that movie</i>

984
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:50,867
<i>and I was so overwhelmed by it,</i>

985
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,328
<i>and I think he was appreciative
that I was being honest.</i>

986
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,582
<i>But I really didn't have any choice</i>

987
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:59,125
<i>because it's one of those movies
that rattles you to your core.</i>

988
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:04,547
<i>And he deserves all the accolades
he's gotten for it.</i>

989
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:08,676
<i>This is really the moment where</i>

990
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,181
<i>the unrelenting action of the movie
kicks in.</i>

991
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:16,351
<i>Basically, from this point forward,
it's a straight-up action film,</i>

992
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:20,855
<i>and we only break for
moments of dramatic tension.</i>

993
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:26,194
<i>There is no stopping from here
to the end of the movie.</i>

994
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,780
<i>And I like the structure of this movie.</i>

995
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,949
<i>And it's something that
a lot of Marvel movies do.</i>

996
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:34,327
<i>I find myself, oftentimes,
watching their movies,</i>

997
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:36,204
<i>thinking at the beginning,</i>

998
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:38,998
<i>"Boy, this is taking its time
to get going."</i>

999
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,500
<i>But the fact of the matter is</i>

1000
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:43,503
<i>Marvel movies take their time
to get to know the characters.</i>

1001
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,964
<i>I felt that way in</i> Captain America,

1002
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:48,258
<i>I felt that way in</i> Civil War <i>this summer.</i>

1003
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,760
<i>I remember feeling that way
when I saw</i> Ant-Man.

1004
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,638
<i>And yet, if you do that,</i>

1005
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:56,474
<i>then when the action starts,
you're so invested in the character,</i>

1006
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:58,351
<i>the action is so much better.</i>

1007
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:04,482
<i>This sequence was shot
mostly practically.</i>

1008
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:07,277
<i>There's obviously visual effects
in the space shards,</i>

1009
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,865
<i>which is what we call the weapons
that Mads and the Zealots carry,</i>

1010
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:14,409
<i>and in the whip,</i>

1011
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,828
<i>the light whip and the shields,</i>

1012
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:20,290
<i>the mandala shields,
that Strange conjures here.</i>

1013
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:21,541
<i>But otherwise,</i>

1014
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:24,002
<i>most of the surrounding
environment here is physical.</i>

1015
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:26,421
<i>This was a real set that we built.
A real hallway.</i>

1016
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:29,966
<i>That was a real wire stunt
that Mads did right there.</i>

1017
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,676
<i>He sure loved the wire work, Mads.</i>

1018
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,970
<i>And he was good at it.</i>

1019
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:37,432
<i>Fifty years old,
and he did almost all of his own stunts</i>

1020
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,767
<i>during this extended fight sequence.</i>

1021
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:46,065
<i>Katrina, our stunt gal,
and the great Scott Adkins</i>

1022
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:49,110
<i>did their own stunts.</i>

1023
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:51,194
<i>They were cast because
they are great stunt people.</i>

1024
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,866
<i>Katrina's the blonde Zealot
in the back.</i>

1025
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,701
<i>And Scott Adkins,
if you don't know him,</i>

1026
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,287
<i>is a movie star in his own right.</i>

1027
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:03,208
<i>Starred in a lot of martial arts movies
in a leading role</i>

1028
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,710
<i>and was gracious enough</i>

1029
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:10,298
<i>to be in this movie as the Zealot.</i>

1030
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:13,092
<i>And I don't know
how we could have done the movie</i>

1031
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:16,930
<i>without an actor as good as him
doing these on-camera stunts.</i>

1032
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,686
<i>If you watch this right here,</i>

1033
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:22,018
<i>he's about to do a kick, Scott Adkins,
that only he does.</i>

1034
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,686
<i>That one right there.</i>

1035
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:27,440
<i>That's his signature kick that,</i>

1036
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:32,320
<i>I believe, you won't see other martial
artists do, because they can't.</i>

1037
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:33,571
<i>It's unique to him.</i>

1038
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,448
<i>I think he may have
made that move up.</i>

1039
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:39,994
<i>This was a part of</i>

1040
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,625
<i>the idea of these kind of
mind-bending action sequences,</i>

1041
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,711
<i>infusing fight scenes with magic.</i>

1042
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,838
<i>We've got these gateway portals
through these doors.</i>

1043
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,091
<i>Look at this stunt right here,
Mads really did that.</i>

1044
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,551
<i>He was pulled up on a wire.
That was him kicking.</i>

1045
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,263
<i>He's just so agile.</i>

1046
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:02,350
<i>And that's why he was so glad to do
a movie where he got to fight.</i>

1047
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:05,395
<i>Maybe it's because he can
and he's good at it.</i>

1048
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,356
<i>But Benedict and Mads</i>

1049
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:12,610
<i>did a lot of their own stunts,
most of their own stunts in here,</i>

1050
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:15,989
<i>so this is mostly, almost all them.</i>

1051
01:00:16,072 --> 01:00:18,157
<i>Not face replacement.
Not stunt doubles.</i>

1052
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:20,410
<i>And as a result,</i>

1053
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:23,955
<i>this was a very
physically demanding scene,</i>

1054
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,665
<i>especially on Benedict.</i>

1055
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:31,879
<i>He got kicked, punched,
thrown against things.</i>

1056
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,214
<i>But he kept going.</i>

1057
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,633
<i>This is a big surprise,</i>

1058
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,927
<i>was a big surprise
for our test audience.</i>

1059
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:41,139
<i>The personality of the cloak
emerging here.</i>

1060
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:44,851
<i>And it was a real unexpected delight
for fans of the comics</i>

1061
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:48,980
<i>because the cloak had some character
in the comics,</i>

1062
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,732
<i>a little bit like a magic carpet.</i>

1063
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,071
<i>But I don't think as extensive
as what you see here,</i>

1064
01:00:57,155 --> 01:01:00,158
<i>where it really becomes
Strange's sidekick.</i>

1065
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:03,036
<i>And it has a sentience
and a personality.</i>

1066
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,662
<i>And it chooses Strange,</i>

1067
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,414
<i>chooses to help him out and save him,</i>

1068
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:10,209
<i>and even seems to have
a sense of humor</i>

1069
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>as we'll see later on.</i>

1070
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,089
<i>But this scene is, in my opinion,</i>

1071
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:18,176
<i>really made to work by this cloak.</i>

1072
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:21,512
<i>It's great fighting,</i>

1073
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:24,766
<i>and great stunt choreography
and stunt design</i>

1074
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,978
<i>by our stunt directors</i>

1075
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:32,440
<i>and some great second unit stuff
shot here by Jeff Habberstad.</i>

1076
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:33,524
<i>But for the most part,</i>

1077
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:37,653
<i>this is watching Strange
in over his head,</i>

1078
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,197
<i>barely surviving,</i>

1079
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,951
<i>getting beaten up mostly,
and the cloak saving him.</i>

1080
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:48,664
<i>And then these, which are
the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak</i>

1081
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:49,874
<i>in the movie, by the way.</i>

1082
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,794
<i>We just took the name out
as we edited the scene down.</i>

1083
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:57,256
<i>This begins the primary villain scene.</i>

1084
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,841
<i>This begins the scene</i>

1085
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:04,389
<i>which will define Kaecilius
in the movie,</i>

1086
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,724
<i>define Mads Mikkelsen's character.</i>

1087
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:11,062
<i>One of the challenges that you have
in making an origin story</i>

1088
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,648
<i>superhero movie
is a problem of real estate.</i>

1089
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:16,317
<i>And again, I didn't feel like
the origin story of Doctor Strange</i>

1090
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,655
<i>merited a two-and-a-half hour
or three-hour movie.</i>

1091
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:24,325
<i>Some movies do.
Some Marvel movies do.</i>

1092
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:27,328
<i>This wasn't one of them,
I didn't think.</i>

1093
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:29,580
<i>And the main reason being that
I don't think,</i>

1094
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:33,751
<i>given the mind trip nature
of the visuals,</i>

1095
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:35,211
<i>I don't think you could bear it.</i>

1096
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:40,341
<i>I think that the sequences are
shorter than most Marvel movies,</i>

1097
01:02:41,134 --> 01:02:43,386
<i>because the audience kept telling us
they were too long,</i>

1098
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:46,180
<i>even though length-wise,
they were shorter</i>

1099
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:49,225
<i>than most action movies
in most Marvel pictures.</i>

1100
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,147
<i>The audience kept saying
they were great,</i>

1101
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:53,438
<i>but they were too long
when we would test the movie,</i>

1102
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:56,023
<i>because it was demanding
to see some of this stuff.</i>

1103
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:59,068
<i>It was something that was taxing.</i>

1104
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:02,280
<i>They loved it, but it was
taking something out of them,</i>

1105
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:05,616
<i>and as we shortened it down
to its fighting weight,</i>

1106
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,368
<i>they began to love it even more.</i>

1107
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:14,000
<i>But one of the problems you have
in making an origin story like this</i>

1108
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:18,212
<i>is the problem of real estate
for the various characters.</i>

1109
01:03:18,296 --> 01:03:20,047
<i>That's why I left Clea out of the movie.</i>

1110
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:21,799
<i>A critical character in the comic books.</i>

1111
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,552
<i>We didn't have time to introduce her.</i>

1112
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:29,599
<i>I thought about using Nightmare
as the primary villain.</i>

1113
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:32,935
<i>But it would've taken too much time
to develop him.</i>

1114
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:38,816
<i>And so, Kaecilius becomes this kind of
Saruman to Dormammu's Sauron.</i>

1115
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,486
<i>This avatar for Dormammu's ideas.</i>

1116
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,529
<i>And I love this scene so much.</i>

1117
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:45,406
<i>And I love Mads' performance here</i>

1118
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:48,659
<i>because everything that he says here
actually makes sense.</i>

1119
01:03:48,743 --> 01:03:51,162
<i>His point of view is very cogent.</i>

1120
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:54,790
<i>He is basically saying</i>

1121
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:59,462
<i>if we can put an end to time itself
and therefore end death,</i>

1122
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,632
<i>that is a victory not just for me,
but for everyone.</i>

1123
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,510
<i>And the Ancient One can do it.
She's proven it.</i>

1124
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:07,470
<i>And the secret is let out</i>

1125
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:11,349
<i>that she's been siphoning off power
from the Dark Dimension</i>

1126
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:13,518
<i>to keep herself alive for centuries.</i>

1127
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:17,355
<i>And that makes her duplicitous.
That makes her a hypocrite.</i>

1128
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:20,441
<i>That makes her a fraud in his mind.</i>

1129
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:23,653
<i>And not only does it discredit her
and her teachings,</i>

1130
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:26,822
<i>not only does it discredit Kamar-Taj
and everything it stands for,</i>

1131
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:30,159
<i>but it sent him into a downward spiral</i>

1132
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:32,745
<i>and into an investigation,
just like Strange,</i>

1133
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:35,706
<i>into the nature of time
and time manipulation,</i>

1134
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,875
<i>and what he found was,</i>

1135
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,545
<i>"Hey, this Dormammu guy,
he's not the Devil."</i>

1136
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:41,712
<i>"He's God."</i>

1137
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:45,091
<i>He's the "intent of all evolution,"
as he says.</i>

1138
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:48,469
<i>Dormammu is gonna take this world
into its Dark Dimension,</i>

1139
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:50,137
<i>and none of us will die.</i>

1140
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:54,141
<i>He's like a cult leader
who's a true believer</i>

1141
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:01,357
<i>in his crazy Zealot point of view.</i>

1142
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,026
<i>So, there was something
about religious zealotry</i>

1143
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:06,946
<i>going on in this movie with Kaecilius.</i>

1144
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,575
<i>His point of view
is a legitimate one,</i>

1145
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,868
<i>and yet, even if he is right,</i>

1146
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,912
<i>even if what he says is true,</i>

1147
01:05:14,996 --> 01:05:17,081
<i>can it ever be a good thing,
as Strange says,</i>

1148
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:21,335
<i>for that passion and that intention
to drive you to kill people.</i>

1149
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:22,545
<i>You know?</i>

1150
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:26,007
<i>And a lot of religious people
over the centuries</i>

1151
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,718
<i>have taken the perspective
of collateral damage</i>

1152
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,803
<i>in the name of religion.</i>

1153
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,514
<i>Some people have to die
to further the cause.</i>

1154
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:37,727
<i>And that's obviously
so inherently problematic.</i>

1155
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,563
<i>This beat always makes me laugh.</i>

1156
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,774
<i>I hope audiences laugh at it,
because I think it's hysterical</i>

1157
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:45,610
<i>that this cloak grabs him by the head</i>

1158
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:49,363
<i>and just starts tossing him around
and banging him so relentlessly</i>

1159
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:53,576
<i>against this big guy, Scott Adkins,
this awesome fighter</i>

1160
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:58,706
<i>just getting completely hammered
by this piece of cloth behind him.</i>

1161
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:05,921
<i>So, I want to go back
to the comic books for a moment</i>

1162
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:10,718
<i>as we venture back into the hospital
with Christine Palmer.</i>

1163
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,846
<i>This upcoming sequence here,</i>

1164
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,224
<i>we always called this the astral battle.</i>

1165
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:20,144
<i>And this sequence was drawn heavily</i>

1166
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:23,147
<i>from a graphic novel of</i> Doctor Strange
<i>called</i> The Oath.

1167
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,816
<i>I don't remember
what year it was published.</i>

1168
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,777
<i>But it was a standalone graphic novel,</i>

1169
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,821
<i>and they had a sequence in that comic,</i>

1170
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:33,449
<i>in that graphic novel,
that was a lot like this,</i>

1171
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:36,410
<i>of Christine Palmer,
who becomes the Night Nurse,</i>

1172
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:41,332
<i>saving Strange's life
while he is in the astral plane.</i>

1173
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,001
<i>I don't believe
there was fighting in that scene.</i>

1174
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:46,962
<i>I don't think there was conflict
between him and another character.</i>

1175
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:50,591
<i>I think it was just that his astral form</i>

1176
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,010
<i>came out
and was observing his own surgery.</i>

1177
01:06:53,094 --> 01:06:55,554
<i>It was so long ago now,
I don't even remember.</i>

1178
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:59,183
<i>But this sequence was the sequence</i>

1179
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:02,937
<i>that I wrote to get the job
directing</i> Doctor Strange.

1180
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:06,023
<i>As I said earlier,
I did a massive presentation,</i>

1181
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:09,151
<i>it was like a 90-minute presentation,
to get the movie.</i>

1182
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,736
<i>And I wrote a 12-page scene,</i>

1183
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,947
<i>which was this scene
from the beginning to the end.</i>

1184
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,032
<i>It was, in some ways, very different,</i>

1185
01:07:15,116 --> 01:07:17,038
<i>and some ways exactly the same
as what you see now.</i>

1186
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:20,413
<i>But it became this set-piece,
and it stayed.</i>

1187
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,331
<i>Her reaction always makes me laugh.</i>

1188
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:25,835
<i>And it's stayed in the movie
ever since then.</i>

1189
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:28,129
<i>Her reaction there,</i>

1190
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,631
<i>and her reaction all through this scene</i>

1191
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:34,969
<i>is why I wanted Rachel McAdams
in this movie.</i>

1192
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,971
No, Christine. But I am dying.

1193
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:38,392
<i>She's a big movie star.</i>

1194
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:42,601
<i>And last year
was in the Oscar-winning film.</i>

1195
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:44,729
<i>And she was nominated for an Oscar.</i>

1196
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:48,190
<i>Let me tell you exactly
why it needs to be Rachel McAdams.</i>

1197
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:52,945
<i>Who else are you gonna cast
that you'd believe being</i>

1198
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:54,780
<i>a former love interest
of Doctor Strange,</i>

1199
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,032
<i>that you'd believe is a medical doctor,</i>

1200
01:07:57,116 --> 01:08:01,370
<i>and who's gonna be able to react
to this crazy magic</i>

1201
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,415
<i>for the first time
in a completely believable way?</i>

1202
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,918
<i>If she doesn't respond to it all
as though it's really happening,</i>

1203
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:09,754
<i>we're not gonna believe this scene.</i>

1204
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,214
<i>And her reactions in here</i>

1205
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:15,801
<i>are so believable
and they're so priceless.</i>

1206
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:17,720
<i>And I said, "She's got strength to her."</i>

1207
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,597
<i>She's sweet and she's strong,</i>

1208
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,183
<i>and that's exactly
what we need from this character.</i>

1209
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,226
<i>And these moments like this,</i>

1210
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,396
<i>she's got great physical
and comedic timing.</i>

1211
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,274
Okay.

1212
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:55,883
Oh, shit.

1213
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:19,160
<i>We were so fortunate
because I got my first choice</i>

1214
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,282
<i>for every role.</i>

1215
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:24,245
<i>Rachel was my first role for Christine.</i>

1216
01:09:25,246 --> 01:09:28,374
<i>Chiwetel was my first role...
Choice for the role of Mordo.</i>

1217
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,918
<i>Mads was my first choice.
Tilda was my first choice.</i>

1218
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:32,837
<i>And Benedict was my first choice.</i>

1219
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,842
<i>So, we were really fortunate to get
the people in this that we wanted.</i>

1220
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,846
<i>This scene was
a lot of wire work for Benedict,</i>

1221
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:45,266
<i>because all this astral stuff,
we actually shot him.</i>

1222
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,351
<i>This is really Benedict on a wire,</i>

1223
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:51,397
<i>and sometimes,
it's what we call a digi-double.</i>

1224
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:56,026
<i>A digital double
that looks like Strange, texturally,</i>

1225
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:59,071
<i>but isn't actually his body,
and sometimes, it's physically him.</i>

1226
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:01,073
<i>But I remember shooting
some of the stuff,</i>

1227
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,701
<i>him going through a lot of agony</i>

1228
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:07,037
<i>because of the speed and motion
of some of the movements</i>

1229
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:09,790
<i>being just physically hard,
physically painful.</i>

1230
01:10:09,874 --> 01:10:11,292
<i>But again, he was a trouper.</i>

1231
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,377
<i>It's hard to be an action star, honestly.</i>

1232
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,129
<i>It's physically difficult.</i>

1233
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:18,966
<i>Here we have a little jump scare,</i>

1234
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:22,219
<i>showing my horror roots.</i>

1235
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:24,513
<i>It's effective in the test screenings,</i>

1236
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,560
<i>because a lot of people
who come to see movies like this</i>

1237
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,520
<i>don't go to horror films,
so they're not used to</i>

1238
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,897
<i>the kind of cheap, easy scare
that that was.</i>

1239
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,233
<i>But it's also pretty obvious and fun.</i>

1240
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:43,324
<i>I really love the humanity
of Strange in this moment.</i>

1241
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:45,910
<i>This apology is great.</i>

1242
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:49,288
<i>I like the fact
that Christine is not mean.</i>

1243
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:50,456
<i>She's not bitter.</i>

1244
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:51,669
<i>But I love her response there</i>

1245
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:53,462
<i>when he says,
"You didn't return my e-mails."</i>

1246
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,252
<i>And she just says, "Why would I?"</i>

1247
01:10:55,336 --> 01:10:56,837
<i>And then he cops to it.</i>

1248
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:59,256
<i>He was such an asshole, he says.</i>

1249
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,967
<i>And it's a sincere apology.</i>

1250
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:05,387
<i>And I think that in the modern world,</i>

1251
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,264
<i>I don't know, man, I feel like</i>

1252
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:11,644
<i>sincere apologies
are becoming a lost art,</i>

1253
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,729
<i>both giving them and accepting them.</i>

1254
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,902
<i>That people don't apologize properly
much anymore,</i>

1255
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:24,281
<i>and when you do apologize,</i>

1256
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:26,742
<i>or when somebody does apologize,</i>

1257
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:28,744
<i>it seems like it's almost
a sign of weakness</i>

1258
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:31,872
<i>to either apologize
or accept an apology,</i>

1259
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:34,083
<i>when I think just the opposite is true.</i>

1260
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,628
<i>I think it takes strength to admit
when you're wrong,</i>

1261
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,130
<i>to apologize to make
something right with somebody.</i>

1262
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,215
<i>It's not easy.</i>

1263
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,009
<i>And it takes a lot of strength
to accept an apology,</i>

1264
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:47,179
<i>especially when you've been
genuinely wronged, like Christine.</i>

1265
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,682
<i>And she clearly has let it go.</i>

1266
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:51,433
<i>She's not bitter or resentful.</i>

1267
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:55,813
<i>But I just think that that's
a really nice human moment there</i>

1268
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,815
<i>between the two of them,</i>

1269
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:01,485
<i>where there's a kind of
acknowledgment and a reconciliation,</i>

1270
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:06,573
<i>but it's not like she's gonna run
back into his arms anytime soon.</i>

1271
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:08,534
<i>And she never does in the movie.</i>

1272
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,996
<i>I felt strongly about that
and so did Rachel.</i>

1273
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,417
<i>That she needed to be
a good feminine character,</i>

1274
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:20,796
<i>and by that, meaning
good at what she does,</i>

1275
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,631
<i>strong, smart,</i>

1276
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:25,718
<i>and not just defined by her
relationship with Doctor Strange.</i>

1277
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,054
<i>She's really defined by her own work</i>

1278
01:12:29,138 --> 01:12:30,681
<i>and her own point of view,</i>

1279
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:34,977
<i>and by her experience of this
fantastical stuff that's happening to her.</i>

1280
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:38,313
<i>Everybody's done it.</i>

1281
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:41,275
<i>Everybody's startled themselves
like that.</i>

1282
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:46,030
<i>So, yeah, she becomes
the audience's eyes</i>

1283
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:49,408
<i>into the magical world
from a normal perspective,</i>

1284
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:52,202
<i>which would be very unnerving,
I would imagine.</i>

1285
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:54,163
<i>It would be scary</i>

1286
01:12:54,246 --> 01:12:59,710
<i>and leave one with frayed nerves,</i>

1287
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,379
<i>and hence, that little last jump scare.</i>

1288
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,550
<i>It wasn't really a jump scare.</i>

1289
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,718
<i>It's really more about just seeing her
be startled by a broomstick.</i>

1290
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,720
<i>I love that shot of the cloak going on.</i>

1291
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,555
<i>It feels iconic to me.</i>

1292
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:16,602
<i>The cloak designed by Alex Byrne
is, I think, awesome.</i>

1293
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:20,397
<i>I really think she nailed that design.</i>

1294
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:22,566
<i>His whole wardrobe,
Doctor Strange's wardrobe</i>

1295
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,234
<i>is very unique,</i>

1296
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:27,071
<i>and I never got tired of looking at it</i>

1297
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,114
<i>and how cool he looked wearing it.</i>

1298
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:31,366
<i>Now this scene is</i>

1299
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,704
<i>one of three dramatic scenes
in the movie,</i>

1300
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:38,457
<i>four dramatic scenes in the movie,
that I really love.</i>

1301
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:39,750
<i>Two of them we've seen,</i>

1302
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,961
<i>which was Tilda
and the Ancient One first meeting.</i>

1303
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:47,049
<i>I love the debate nature
of that conversation,</i>

1304
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,510
<i>and how unflappable
the Ancient One is</i>

1305
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:53,097
<i>and how arrogant Strange is
before she shatters him.</i>

1306
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,933
<i>The second is Strange's dialogue
with Kaecilius,</i>

1307
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:58,894
<i>because I think Kaecilius'
point of view is so compelling.</i>

1308
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:02,564
<i>I'm in agreement with him in theory
but not in practice.</i>

1309
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:05,025
<i>And this is the third scene,</i>

1310
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:06,443
<i>and I like this scene because</i>

1311
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:10,614
<i>all three of these relationships
completely change in this scene.</i>

1312
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,199
<i>They fundamentally change.</i>

1313
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:15,577
<i>Strange has been given this
information about the Ancient One,</i>

1314
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:19,123
<i>and he is angry now.</i>

1315
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,042
<i>He's angry because he's found out
about her duplicity.</i>

1316
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:25,712
<i>That she borrows
from the Dark Dimension,</i>

1317
01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:30,884
<i>a practice which she forbids,
to keep herself alive.</i>

1318
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:34,179
<i>And it's such a violation,</i>

1319
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:36,765
<i>such a hypocritical thing to do</i>

1320
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:39,309
<i>that Mordo just straight up
doesn't believe it.</i>

1321
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:41,311
<i>And when the scene is over,</i>

1322
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:43,564
<i>everybody feels differently
about everybody else.</i>

1323
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:47,442
<i>Strange is angry with the Ancient One.</i>

1324
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:52,364
<i>Mordo is, I think, frightened that
Strange may be telling the truth.</i>

1325
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:54,158
<i>And that makes him angry.</i>

1326
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,577
<i>Anger is, more often than not,</i>

1327
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:01,456
<i>a mask for fear.</i>

1328
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,042
<i>Behind most anger is fear.</i>

1329
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:06,837
<i>And behind most fear is a fear of loss.</i>

1330
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:09,006
<i>And Mordo, as he hears this,</i>

1331
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:14,261
<i>fears the loss of security that
he feels around the Ancient One.</i>

1332
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,013
<i>He fears the loss of her,</i>

1333
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:22,019
<i>of the purity of the Kamar-Taj idea,</i>

1334
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:26,523
<i>and the purity of sorcery
as it's been taught to him.</i>

1335
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,609
<i>The moral code of this place.</i>

1336
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,111
<i>So, I love that expression.</i>

1337
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:33,864
<i>He doesn't accept it.</i>

1338
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:35,324
<i>He doesn't even really consider it</i>

1339
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:38,535
<i>because it would be too big
of a thing for him.</i>

1340
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:43,540
<i>And then, in here, we see
the first inkling of, "Could it be true?"</i>

1341
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:45,209
<i>She knows that he's right,</i>

1342
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:49,963
<i>and she is inscrutable, as usual.</i>

1343
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:52,883
<i>And now the conflict starts</i>

1344
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:58,680
<i>because Strange believes
that her secret is a serious one</i>

1345
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:00,891
<i>and they get right into it.</i>

1346
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:03,810
<i>And Strange is being driven, I think,</i>

1347
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:06,313
<i>as we talked about this with the actors,</i>

1348
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,899
<i>Strange is less bothered by the fact</i>

1349
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:12,319
<i>that the Ancient One was borrowing
power from the Dark Dimension.</i>

1350
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:16,198
<i>He's bothered by the fact
that he just joined a battle.</i>

1351
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:19,076
<i>That he had to fight to defend his life
and he killed a guy.</i>

1352
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:22,621
<i>He's upset at this whole thing.</i>

1353
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:27,626
<i>And he's been thrown into it
before he's ready.</i>

1354
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:31,171
<i>And Mordo objects to what he thinks</i>

1355
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:35,550
<i>is the sanctimony of saying,
you can't be taking people's lives.</i>

1356
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:37,928
<i>And Mordo's position is
of course you can</i>

1357
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:41,223
<i>if it's kill or be killed.</i>

1358
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:42,933
<i>If it's them or us.</i>

1359
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,644
<i>If it's take them out,
or they're gonna destroy everything.</i>

1360
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:47,938
<i>And here they are,
if they bring down the Sanctum,</i>

1361
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:53,151
<i>we know that the protection
of the Sanctums</i>

1362
01:16:53,235 --> 01:16:55,696
<i>that keep Dormammu
away from this world will fall.</i>

1363
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:59,366
<i>So, this battle gets it on,</i>

1364
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,660
<i>and here we go
into the Mirror Dimension.</i>

1365
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,791
<i>This is where we start to pay off
those earlier scenes</i>

1366
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,127
<i>where we took time
to explain what it was.</i>

1367
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,796
<i>And it was always tricky,
with things like the Mirror Dimension,</i>

1368
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:15,215
<i>to explain the rules,
but not over-explain them.</i>

1369
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:19,636
<i>We have all the logic
worked out completely,</i>

1370
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:23,140
<i>but there's a limit
to what an audience wants to hear.</i>

1371
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:27,811
<i>And I find that to be a mistake
a lot of times in movies,</i>

1372
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:32,774
<i>where you can feel the filmmakers</i>

1373
01:17:32,858 --> 01:17:36,069
<i>going out of their way
to explain every possible objection.</i>

1374
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:41,366
<i>And it's like, "Hey,
it's a superhero, I get it."</i>

1375
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,660
<i>In this case, "It's magic. I get it."</i>

1376
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:45,495
<i>You want to know enough
not to be confused</i>

1377
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:46,872
<i>by what's going on,</i>

1378
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:49,791
<i>but you don't have to have every rule,</i>

1379
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:54,004
<i>every possible exception
to the rule explained</i>

1380
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:57,257
<i>because you would spend
your whole movie doing that.</i>

1381
01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,301
<i>And that makes for bad drama.</i>

1382
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,846
<i>So, here, Mordo says
they're like gods in here.</i>

1383
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,848
<i>They are much more powerful in here</i>

1384
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:07,017
<i>because they're drawing
on the Dark Dimension.</i>

1385
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,311
<i>It gives them incredible power,</i>

1386
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,521
<i>power that Mordo and Strange
don't have</i>

1387
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,024
<i>the way that Kaecilius has.</i>

1388
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,942
<i>And all of that being a setup...</i>

1389
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:18,820
<i>Well, first of all,
for the Stan Lee cameo,</i>

1390
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,614
<i>I love that cameo.</i>

1391
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:25,535
<i>Just laughing at Aldous Huxley's</i>
Doors of Perception, <i>just is funny.</i>

1392
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:27,454
<i>I think it's a really great cameo.</i>

1393
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,498
<i>I also want to give a shout-out
to James Gunn</i>

1394
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,750
<i>because he shot that cameo.</i>

1395
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,835
<i>It was my idea
to put him on the bus,</i>

1396
01:18:33,919 --> 01:18:36,671
<i>and the</i> Doors of Perception
<i>and all that.</i>

1397
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:41,885
<i>But Stan Lee did four cameos
at one time</i>

1398
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:45,764
<i>in Atlanta on the</i> Guardians 2 <i>set.</i>

1399
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:49,184
<i>And so,
James shot four different cameos</i>

1400
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,187
<i>for four different movies,
including</i> Guardians 2

1401
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,397
<i>and including mine.</i>

1402
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,608
<i>He was texting me through the day
to let me know what he was doing.</i>

1403
01:18:56,691 --> 01:19:01,279
<i>I've spoken to Stan Lee on the phone,
but I've yet to meet him in person.</i>

1404
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:05,617
<i>This is ILM's masterful work here.</i>

1405
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:09,621
<i>A lot of people, when they would see
stuff like this in the trailers,</i>

1406
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:12,249
<i>they would claim that we are
ripping off</i> Inception.

1407
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:17,963
<i>I want to run toward that comment
and say we weren't ripping it off.</i>

1408
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:19,714
<i>I certainly was drawing on it.</i>

1409
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:23,468
<i>I thought</i> Inception <i>was one of</i>

1410
01:19:23,552 --> 01:19:26,232
<i>the most visually interesting movies
of the last six or seven years.</i>

1411
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:29,599
<i>But it was seven years ago,
now, that it came out.</i>

1412
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:34,604
<i>And I felt like it was the tip of
an interesting visual effects iceberg.</i>

1413
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,773
<i>And I wanted to go crazy</i>

1414
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:40,402
<i>with the idea of
spatial manipulation like that.</i>

1415
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:45,031
<i>And we looked at Escher
and Dali and German Expressionism,</i>

1416
01:19:45,115 --> 01:19:46,575
<i>and all these different things.</i>

1417
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:50,537
<i>Just really went hog wild
trying to build upon</i>

1418
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,291
<i>what Chris Nolan
was starting in</i> Inception.

1419
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,793
<i>I guess in the same way that
Chris Nolan was building on</i>

1420
01:19:56,877 --> 01:20:03,550
On Her Majesty's Secret Service
<i>for the climactic snow fight at the end.</i>

1421
01:20:04,301 --> 01:20:06,386
<i>That's what we filmmakers do.</i>

1422
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:09,556
<i>We borrow from other sources
and from each other.</i>

1423
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:16,396
<i>But hopefully, it's just standing
on the shoulders of that movie</i>

1424
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,108
<i>rather than, in any way,
ripping it off or repeating it.</i>

1425
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,820
<i>That was certainly the idea.</i>

1426
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:27,240
<i>This sequence here, I like very much,</i>

1427
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:29,826
<i>because it is so visually unique,</i>

1428
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:33,497
<i>and more so because
of the character dialogue here</i>

1429
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,499
<i>between the Ancient One
and Kaecilius.</i>

1430
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:40,295
<i>Again, all this spectacle,
all this visual power,</i>

1431
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:44,299
<i>is only as meaningful or only as good</i>

1432
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:49,763
<i>or only as significant as
the characters.</i>

1433
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:53,892
<i>And in this case, you feel the humanity
of Kaecilius coming through</i>

1434
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:57,395
<i>and you realize his real motive
is he feels betrayed.</i>

1435
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:02,859
<i>He feels that she was
duplicitous and hypocritical,</i>

1436
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:07,239
<i>and when he learned
what he learned</i>

1437
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:10,867
<i>about the Dark Dimension,
he coveted that eternal life.</i>

1438
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,786
<i>He wanted to not die.</i>

1439
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:15,038
<i>And again,
we're getting religious themes here</i>

1440
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:17,249
<i>and themes of religious zealotry.</i>

1441
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:21,586
<i>And how much damage
has been done in the world</i>

1442
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:25,549
<i>because of people believing</i>

1443
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:27,968
<i>that they had
the only right point of view</i>

1444
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:31,721
<i>about what lies beyond our senses,</i>

1445
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:33,932
<i>and want to live forever.</i>

1446
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,016
<i>You know?</i>

1447
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,019
<i>And that can be
a very dangerous thing.</i>

1448
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:40,605
<i>I'm a religious person,</i>

1449
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:44,276
<i>but I also recognize
the dangers of religion.</i>

1450
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:45,652
<i>In the world right now,</i>

1451
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:49,406
<i>I'm seeing those dangers play out
in pretty awful ways.</i>

1452
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:51,533
<i>And I guess that found its way
into the movie.</i>

1453
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:55,370
<i>Here we've got</i>

1454
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:58,707
<i>a break point in the movie,</i>

1455
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,668
<i>which is this injury for the Ancient One</i>

1456
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:05,630
<i>that leads to probably
my favorite scene in the film,</i>

1457
01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:09,384
<i>which is this balcony chat</i>

1458
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:12,262
<i>that's coming up between Strange
and the Ancient One.</i>

1459
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:16,478
<i>And I suppose this is probably
the best place in the commentary</i>

1460
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:20,770
<i>to talk about
the greater meaning of the movie.</i>

1461
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:23,273
<i>And again, like I said before,</i>

1462
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:29,070
<i>I don't like being reductive
about what a movie means,</i>

1463
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:30,572
<i>because it means a lot of things.</i>

1464
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,700
<i>There's a lot of things in here,
hopefully, to pull out of it</i>

1465
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:35,619
<i>if you want to.</i>

1466
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,832
<i>And if you don't, I hope
it's just entertaining.</i>

1467
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:41,541
<i>A lot of times, I'll watch movies where
I know there's interesting themes,</i>

1468
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,004
<i>but I don't think much about them</i>

1469
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,378
<i>because I just want to be
entertained by them</i>

1470
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:48,590
<i>and this movie is intended to function
on that level.</i>

1471
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:51,760
<i>If you want a good popcorn movie,
this is a good popcorn movie.</i>

1472
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:55,680
<i>But there are some deeper themes
and emotions and ideas in it.</i>

1473
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:58,475
<i>And in this case,</i>

1474
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:03,229
<i>it's really a movie
that gets to the heart of</i>

1475
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:07,317
<i>time, death, meaning.</i>

1476
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,487
<i>Why we're here, what we do.</i>

1477
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:14,491
<i>And Strange demonstrates,</i>

1478
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,661
<i>in the beginning of the movie,
a lot of what we're told.</i>

1479
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:20,455
<i>At least in my country, in America,</i>

1480
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:24,292
<i>a lot of what we're told
is supposed to be the goal.</i>

1481
01:23:24,376 --> 01:23:27,712
<i>Your own happiness.
Your own success.</i>

1482
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:29,923
<i>Live your dream.</i>

1483
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:32,092
<i>And I'm not disparaging
any of those things.</i>

1484
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:34,135
<i>Those are good things, not bad things.</i>

1485
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:37,013
<i>But they don't make life purposeful.</i>

1486
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:39,849
<i>Love makes life purposeful.</i>

1487
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:44,854
<i>Becoming devoted to
something bigger than yourself</i>

1488
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,816
<i>is what makes life purposeful.</i>

1489
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:52,570
<i>And being willing to commit yourself
to something larger than yourself,</i>

1490
01:23:52,654 --> 01:23:56,866
<i>even in a self-sacrificial way,
is very meaningful.</i>

1491
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:02,622
<i>And I think the signature line of
the movie is coming up right here,</i>

1492
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:06,543
<i>when she tells him that</i>

1493
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:08,214
<i>in all your learning
and everything you've done,</i>

1494
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:12,132
<i>you still failed to learn the simplest
and most significant lesson of all.</i>

1495
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:14,134
<i>And that is it's not about you.</i>

1496
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:17,887
<i>And I felt that that was so
at the heart of</i> Doctor Strange

1497
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,098
<i>and so at the heart of
what the movie was about.</i>

1498
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:22,726
<i>I designed this specific
camera move for it.</i>

1499
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:24,894
<i>I shot everything
on this side of the line,</i>

1500
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:29,441
<i>and this shot is visually
Strange's realization.</i>

1501
01:24:29,524 --> 01:24:35,155
<i>That shot was to demonstrate him
coming around to the other side.</i>

1502
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:36,740
<i>Him coming around, literally.</i>

1503
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:39,951
<i>I never thought about it
as literally as I just spoke it.</i>

1504
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,119
<i>But that's what it is.</i>

1505
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:46,416
<i>And I think that
the camera is a storyteller.</i>

1506
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:49,169
<i>And there's a good example of
how a camera angle,</i>

1507
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:50,920
<i>the movement of a shot,</i>

1508
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:53,923
<i>is seminal to
the most significant moment</i>

1509
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:55,967
<i>of our character's development.</i>

1510
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:59,429
<i>And then she goes to lay on to him
the fact that he has a choice in life.</i>

1511
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,473
<i>He can go back to
everything that he wants,</i>

1512
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:02,849
<i>everything that's about him.</i>

1513
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:06,186
<i>Or he can move on
to something bigger than himself.</i>

1514
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:07,645
<i>He can evolve.</i>

1515
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:12,192
<i>And I love the fact
that this movie is about</i>

1516
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:15,737
<i>mysticism and spirituality and growth,</i>

1517
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,490
<i>because I think that
those are the important things.</i>

1518
01:25:18,573 --> 01:25:20,450
<i>I think life is about growth.</i>

1519
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:23,953
<i>That's how I feel, and it's my belief.</i>

1520
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:28,208
<i>And I think the world
is a mystical place.</i>

1521
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:29,667
<i>It's innate in me.</i>

1522
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:33,922
<i>I wasn't raised
in a particularly religious home.</i>

1523
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:36,966
<i>But from my earliest memories,</i>

1524
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:40,970
<i>I remember thinking and feeling
that the material world</i>

1525
01:25:41,054 --> 01:25:42,680
<i>was not only not all there is,</i>

1526
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,474
<i>it's not even most of what there is.</i>

1527
01:25:46,935 --> 01:25:51,189
<i>The real world is much bigger than
what I could sense with my senses.</i>

1528
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:53,942
<i>I always felt that way about life.</i>

1529
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:57,362
<i>And it gave a magical feeling
to the world.</i>

1530
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:59,989
<i>I was also really frightened as a child.</i>

1531
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:01,828
<i>And I think
that's one of the reasons why,</i>

1532
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:05,328
<i>because the world was
a dangerous place</i>

1533
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,498
<i>and very unknown to me. Still is.</i>

1534
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:09,999
<i>But I don't feel afraid of it.</i>

1535
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,086
<i>I feel inspired by it
and awe-inspired by it.</i>

1536
01:26:13,378 --> 01:26:15,588
<i>And I think every artist
feels that way to some degree.</i>

1537
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:17,799
<i>I think every scientist
feels that way to some degree.</i>

1538
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:22,595
<i>People who explore
and venture into discovery,</i>

1539
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:24,305
<i>we all feel that way.</i>

1540
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:27,183
<i>And I think people
who don't do that for a living</i>

1541
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:31,479
<i>feel that way and need things
like art and science</i>

1542
01:26:31,563 --> 01:26:34,190
<i>to show them
what they don't understand,</i>

1543
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:36,234
<i>or to give them a sense</i>

1544
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:41,197
<i>that the world is a wondrous
and magical place.</i>

1545
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:46,035
<i>But that scene,
it's pretty impressive</i>

1546
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,497
<i>that that's my favorite scene
given how much work...</i>

1547
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:53,668
<i>Not impressive, but it's like
the movie is impressing me.</i>

1548
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:56,880
<i>That's my favorite scene.</i>

1549
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:58,882
<i>It's impressive that the actors</i>

1550
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:01,092
<i>delivered a scene
that was that touching.</i>

1551
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:03,348
<i>Because that scene's better
than I thought it was gonna be.</i>

1552
01:27:03,428 --> 01:27:06,014
<i>I knew it was important.
I knew it was significant.</i>

1553
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:07,599
<i>I didn't know it was as significant</i>

1554
01:27:07,682 --> 01:27:10,184
<i>as I think it is in the movie
until I shot it.</i>

1555
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:15,607
<i>But I remember meeting
James Cameron on the set of</i> Avatar.

1556
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:19,736
<i>When he was shooting it, I went down
to the set at Playa del Rey</i>

1557
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:25,658
<i>to talk to him about the cameras
and to see...</i>

1558
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:29,329
<i>He was showing filmmakers
the 3-D technology,</i>

1559
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:31,581
<i>the performance capture technology,</i>

1560
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:32,999
<i>and how it all worked.</i>

1561
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:35,084
<i>And I went down,
and he took a lot of time with me.</i>

1562
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,420
<i>I was really interested
in the technology.</i>

1563
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,255
<i>I was asking a lot of questions,</i>

1564
01:27:39,339 --> 01:27:41,758
<i>and he was taking time
to answer those questions.</i>

1565
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:45,303
<i>And I remember him saying</i>

1566
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:50,433
<i>that one of the lessons
that he learned in doing</i> The Abyss

1567
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,977
<i>was that he had focused so much</i>

1568
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:56,481
<i>on all these big giant
visual effects sequences,</i>

1569
01:27:56,564 --> 01:27:59,984
<i>and what he was surprised by</i>

1570
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:03,279
<i>was that the best scene in the movie
was two people in an air tank.</i>

1571
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,531
<i>And that's why
when he went to make</i> Titanic,

1572
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:06,699
<i>as he put it,</i>

1573
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:10,745
<i>by the time the iceberg hit the ship,
most movies had ended</i>

1574
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:12,705
<i>because he was doing</i>

1575
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:16,292
<i>so much character development
in that scene.</i>

1576
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:20,046
<i>And it all gets back to characters.</i>

1577
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:22,298
<i>You've got to become invested
in these characters.</i>

1578
01:28:22,382 --> 01:28:25,009
<i>This gag, by the way, gets
a great laugh in our test screenings.</i>

1579
01:28:25,093 --> 01:28:26,970
<i>We'll see how it does
in public theaters,</i>

1580
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:28,693
<i>this bit with the cloak wiping the tears.</i>

1581
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,807
<i>And that was Benedict's idea.</i>

1582
01:28:31,057 --> 01:28:32,617
<i>I wish I could
take credit for the idea,</i>

1583
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:36,229
<i>but he had come up with the idea,
and I thought it was great.</i>

1584
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:38,106
<i>So, we did it.</i>

1585
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:41,109
<i>Filmmaking is like that,</i>

1586
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:43,361
<i>especially filmmaking at this size.</i>

1587
01:28:43,444 --> 01:28:47,198
<i>You've gotta be egoless about it.</i>

1588
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:48,866
<i>You can't have a big ego</i>

1589
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:52,495
<i>and be a good filmmaker at this level</i>

1590
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,372
<i>because it's too big.</i>

1591
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:55,665
<i>You need everybody's input.</i>

1592
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,250
<i>You need everybody's feedback.</i>

1593
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:02,463
<i>And I think that
the Marvel process is great</i>

1594
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:04,632
<i>because these guys are artists.</i>

1595
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:08,344
<i>Kevin Feige,
Stephen Broussard, my producer,</i>

1596
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:11,639
<i>Victoria Alonso
who runs post-production here,</i>

1597
01:29:11,723 --> 01:29:14,767
<i>and Louis D'Esposito,
who's the co-head with Kevin Feige.</i>

1598
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,105
<i>The four of them are filmmakers first.
They're artists.</i>

1599
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:21,441
<i>And they represent</i>

1600
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:24,485
<i>an attitude that's unlike other studios.</i>

1601
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,529
<i>Walt Disney once said,</i>

1602
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:29,657
<i>"We don't make movies
to make money."</i>

1603
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:32,076
<i>"We make money
to make more movies."</i>

1604
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,538
<i>And that's definitely the way
it is here at Marvel.</i>

1605
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:40,001
<i>They're not motivated by
how much money they make.</i>

1606
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,298
<i>They want to make money
so they can keep making movies.</i>

1607
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:45,214
<i>They're motivated by movies.
They love cinema.</i>

1608
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:46,966
<i>They love movies.</i>

1609
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:51,304
<i>And the commitment to that process
and the lack of ego that they have,</i>

1610
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:56,184
<i>creatively, is why their movies
tend to turn out good.</i>

1611
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:58,895
<i>Because they are always fighting
for the best idea,</i>

1612
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:00,733
<i>and they work
pretty intimately with filmmakers.</i>

1613
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:03,191
<i>I've had a great experience
working with them.</i>

1614
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:04,525
<i>And Kevin, in particular,</i>

1615
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:08,112
<i>is a true genius at knowing
when something's not working</i>

1616
01:30:08,196 --> 01:30:09,405
<i>and helping you make it work,</i>

1617
01:30:09,489 --> 01:30:11,574
<i>and helping you see
how it can be better.</i>

1618
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:17,497
<i>This is the scene
when Mordo really starts to break.</i>

1619
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:19,919
<i>And I think it's important
to draw attention</i>

1620
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,418
<i>to the fact that I think he's right here.</i>

1621
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:24,045
<i>Essentially, they're both right.</i>

1622
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,090
<i>But he is right
that the Ancient One was duplicitous.</i>

1623
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:28,633
<i>The Ancient One was hypocritical.</i>

1624
01:30:28,716 --> 01:30:32,970
<i>She taught something was
forbidden, but she practiced it herself.</i>

1625
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:36,224
<i>And she didn't
entrust that to anybody else,</i>

1626
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:40,144
<i>and that's what led Kaecilius to
Dormammu and created all this chaos.</i>

1627
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:42,855
<i>He is right about that. But he's so rigid.</i>

1628
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:44,941
<i>He, as the Ancient One said, he is...</i>

1629
01:30:45,024 --> 01:30:46,734
<i>To me,
he's almost like a fundamentalist.</i>

1630
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:50,905
<i>He has the rules,
the fixed ways that things should be.</i>

1631
01:30:50,988 --> 01:30:54,992
<i>And when the beliefs
of a fundamentalist are broken,</i>

1632
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:57,954
<i>it's sometimes
a really violent breaking.</i>

1633
01:30:58,037 --> 01:31:00,832
<i>And we see
the beginnings of that breaking now.</i>

1634
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:03,709
<i>Now, he's still gotta
try to save the world here.</i>

1635
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:05,002
<i>Literally.</i>

1636
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,380
<i>But we're gonna see by the end tag,</i>

1637
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:10,466
<i>that he's really starting to crack
and go off the deep end.</i>

1638
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,051
<i>But Strange is also right.</i>

1639
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,178
<i>And the Ancient One is also right.</i>

1640
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:16,267
<i>And in the end, I sided
with Strange and the Ancient One</i>

1641
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:19,934
<i>that sometimes you have to
break the rules for the greater good.</i>

1642
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:21,811
<i>But the moral dilemma of that</i>

1643
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:26,607
<i>is something that's
not simple to break down.</i>

1644
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:27,945
<i>I didn't want to be reductive about it.</i>

1645
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:29,402
<i>I like the complexity of it,</i>

1646
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:32,405
<i>and I wanted them to
both have a good point of view.</i>

1647
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:38,202
<i>This is the most difficult sequence
in the movie, technically.</i>

1648
01:31:38,286 --> 01:31:39,328
<i>By far.</i>

1649
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:43,791
<i>I started with this idea,</i>

1650
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:46,919
<i>I think while
we were outlining the movie,</i>

1651
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:54,719
<i>to end it as a kind of play
on the trope of Marvel movies</i>

1652
01:31:54,802 --> 01:31:59,640
<i>ending with the characters
tearing up a city and a portal closing</i>

1653
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:03,311
<i>and keeping out something
from another world.</i>

1654
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,022
<i>So, in this case,
instead of tearing up a city,</i>

1655
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:08,191
<i>I wanted to put a city back together.</i>

1656
01:32:08,274 --> 01:32:11,694
<i>And the idea was to have a fight scene
running forwards in time,</i>

1657
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:17,158
<i>while an entire cityscape is
coming back together in reverse time,</i>

1658
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:18,910
<i>and it was impossible.</i>

1659
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:21,207
<i>When I thought about it, I thought,
"Well, wait, you can't do that.</i>"

1660
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:22,542
<i>"I wouldn't even know how to do that."</i>

1661
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:24,874
<i>And then I thought,
"No, that's the reason to do it.</i>"

1662
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:29,253
<i>"Because it's unshootable, let's do it
and let's figure out how to do it."</i>

1663
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:34,884
<i>And the result was an incredibly
complex scene, technically.</i>

1664
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:36,427
<i>A lot of motion control,</i>

1665
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:39,222
<i>which is a repeatable camera</i>

1666
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:42,058
<i>that runs on track
and can repeat the identical move.</i>

1667
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:44,185
<i>A lot of different layers of elements.</i>

1668
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,062
<i>Explosions, dust,</i>

1669
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:50,024
<i>material being dropped into frame
so it can be played backwards.</i>

1670
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:55,488
<i>And the actors having to react to things</i>

1671
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,490
<i>that were designed
to be shot in reverse.</i>

1672
01:32:57,573 --> 01:32:59,200
<i>It was all just very complicated.</i>

1673
01:32:59,283 --> 01:33:01,118
<i>But I think
it comes together really nicely,</i>

1674
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:03,371
<i>and it's sewn together really nicely</i>

1675
01:33:03,454 --> 01:33:07,708
<i>by Michael Giacchino's very creepy,
weird, surreal score here.</i>

1676
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:11,545
<i>And the result is
a sequence that just doesn't...</i>

1677
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:13,214
<i>To me, it doesn't feel like the climax</i>

1678
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:15,925
<i>of any other superhero movie
that I've seen.</i>

1679
01:33:16,008 --> 01:33:17,260
<i>Um...</i>

1680
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:19,595
<i>Every time I say "um,"</i>

1681
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,556
<i>I always hear
my old high school English teacher,</i>

1682
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,725
<i>Mrs. Cannon, saying,
"No ums, please."</i>

1683
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:26,060
<i>She would always say that.</i>

1684
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:28,771
<i>And I've heard her voice in my head</i>

1685
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,940
<i>about 10 times
during this commentary track,</i>

1686
01:33:31,023 --> 01:33:34,568
<i>because you say "um"
as a pause to gather your thoughts.</i>

1687
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:38,781
<i>So, my apologies to my high school
English teacher for the "ums."</i>

1688
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:43,786
<i>So, instead of ending the movie
with this big battle scene,</i>

1689
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,497
<i>destroying a city,
we put a city back together.</i>

1690
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,457
<i>And instead of closing the portal,</i>

1691
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:52,962
<i>we've got this opening to
the Dark Dimension that's remaining.</i>

1692
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:56,674
<i>And I love the idea that</i>

1693
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:59,635
<i>instead of closing it,
Strange goes into it.</i>

1694
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:02,972
<i>And we're gonna
go into another dimension.</i>

1695
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:08,853
<i>And that was also an idea
from the very beginning of the movie.</i>

1696
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:14,942
<i>And we were looking for
a final beat for the final scene.</i>

1697
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:18,571
<i>I knew that I wanted to
do this forwards-backwards thing.</i>

1698
01:34:19,447 --> 01:34:22,825
<i>And I knew that I wanted to
have some kind of a solution</i>

1699
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,327
<i>that didn't feel typical.</i>

1700
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:27,872
<i>It wasn't just saving the city
and closing off the Dark Dimension</i>

1701
01:34:27,955 --> 01:34:28,956
<i>and ending there.</i>

1702
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:34,211
<i>And so, as we were
brainstorming with Jon Spaihts,</i>

1703
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:36,839
<i>who wrote the first draft,</i>

1704
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:40,301
<i>I remember saying,
"Well, you know, we've got time."</i>

1705
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,887
<i>And I remember saying,
"What if there was a time loop?"</i>

1706
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,181
<i>And I'd never heard the phrase before.</i>

1707
01:34:45,348 --> 01:34:47,975
<i>This Tim Burton movie
that just came out,</i>

1708
01:34:48,142 --> 01:34:51,103
<i>apparently uses that term</i>

1709
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:53,356
<i>and I wasn't familiar
with that property or anything.</i>

1710
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:59,403
<i>But I loved the idea of Strange
going into a dimension without time,</i>

1711
01:34:59,487 --> 01:35:00,780
<i>and bringing time into it.</i>

1712
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:06,369
<i>It seemed important that
the ending deal with time,</i>

1713
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:09,497
<i>because time was
so thematically present in the movie.</i>

1714
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:16,295
<i>The idea that
the watch represents time and love</i>

1715
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:20,549
<i>and time heals all wounds,
and in some cases, it doesn't.</i>

1716
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:24,970
<i>And Kaecilius' entire philosophy,
that time is the true enemy.</i>

1717
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:27,098
<i>Time kills everything.</i>

1718
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:29,725
<i>The Dark Dimension
being a timeless place.</i>

1719
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:34,021
<i>Strange manipulating time
with the Eye of Agamotto,</i>

1720
01:35:34,105 --> 01:35:35,648
<i>and then reversing time.</i>

1721
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:41,195
<i>We had to deal with time itself
as a final way of ending the movie.</i>

1722
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:45,699
<i>And for everybody who's
ever played video games growing up,</i>

1723
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:49,703
<i>which is almost everybody probably
watching this movie by this point,</i>

1724
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:52,415
<i>the idea is this is a boss fight.</i>

1725
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:54,253
<i>This all leads
to a big boss fight at the end,</i>

1726
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:58,921
<i>and this is a section where I wanted to
get this black light kind of look</i>

1727
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:02,800
<i>from the psychedelic black light poster
that I loved so much</i>

1728
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:06,095
<i>that it's a banner on my Twitter feed
or at least is at this point.</i>

1729
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:08,218
<i>I'm sure I'll take it down
after the movie releases.</i>

1730
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:12,768
<i>For Strange to go into this
completely psychedelic environment</i>

1731
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:15,604
<i>that's different than anything
we've seen before and unique</i>

1732
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,857
<i>and to meet Dormammu,</i>

1733
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,109
<i>this other-dimensional entity
beyond time,</i>

1734
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:26,323
<i>and to use time as a way
of defeating him was the goal.</i>

1735
01:36:26,407 --> 01:36:27,450
<i>It was the idea.</i>

1736
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:34,248
<i>And it's one of the only scenes
that started in the first draft,</i>

1737
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:38,627
<i>and remained almost identical
all the way through the script.</i>

1738
01:36:38,711 --> 01:36:39,962
<i>It was never changed much.</i>

1739
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:44,133
<i>Jon Spaihts wrote this scene
pretty much as you're seeing it here,</i>

1740
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:49,305
<i>with a few lines adjusted,
a few lines added or subtracted,</i>

1741
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,432
<i>and some editorial work.</i>

1742
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:54,477
<i>But fundamentally, the scene
that he wrote was this scene.</i>

1743
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,188
<i>And I just thought it was really cool</i>

1744
01:36:57,271 --> 01:37:02,067
<i>that Strange goes up there
to confront Dormammu and gets killed.</i>

1745
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:06,780
<i>And then comes back
because he's created a time loop,</i>

1746
01:37:06,864 --> 01:37:12,995
<i>and he's using time itself
to defeat this other-dimensional being.</i>

1747
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:17,374
<i>This little move right here
was not in the script,</i>

1748
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:20,794
<i>and it was not a directorial idea.</i>

1749
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:23,172
<i>And not Wyatt Smith,
our primary editor,</i>

1750
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:27,176
<i>but Jeff Ford, who did some additional
editing for us toward the end.</i>

1751
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:29,386
<i>He came up with that,
and it really helped</i>

1752
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:32,515
<i>explain visually
what we were doing with this scene.</i>

1753
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:37,061
<i>But I loved just the '60s psychedelia
making its way into this movie.</i>

1754
01:37:37,144 --> 01:37:39,980
<i>And this is obviously
the scene where it does this,</i>

1755
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:44,026
<i>and there's this big lumbering,
God-like being</i>

1756
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:47,321
<i>that is trapped by time.</i>

1757
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,156
<i>And at this point, he doesn't even get it.</i>

1758
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,784
<i>He doesn't even really
understand what's happening to him,</i>

1759
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:55,162
<i>because he doesn't
understand the concept of time.</i>

1760
01:37:55,246 --> 01:37:58,999
<i>Doesn't exist in a place
where things age.</i>

1761
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:04,630
<i>And of course, the psychedelic
trippy-ness of it, the score,</i>

1762
01:38:04,964 --> 01:38:10,970
<i>the visual effects of the world,
the visual effect of Dormammu himself,</i>

1763
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:14,974
<i>is all in the service
of not just ending the plot</i>

1764
01:38:15,266 --> 01:38:17,893
<i>but concluding the character arc.</i>

1765
01:38:18,102 --> 01:38:22,064
<i>Concluding the character arc
of Doctor Strange.</i>

1766
01:38:22,147 --> 01:38:24,817
<i>And the completion of it is that</i>

1767
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:29,530
<i>he finally demonstrates,
by what he says here,</i>

1768
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:32,366
<i>that he does understand
that it's not about him.</i>

1769
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:33,909
<i>He does understand</i>

1770
01:38:33,993 --> 01:38:39,748
<i>that he has to make a self-sacrifice,</i>

1771
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:42,585
<i>that people in the world
are more important than him,</i>

1772
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:45,796
<i>that he is accepting a position,
and it's a painful position,</i>

1773
01:38:46,005 --> 01:38:51,051
<i>a position of difficulty and struggle
to service the world</i>

1774
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,845
<i>and to protect the world.</i>

1775
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:54,346
<i>And it's what I always loved</i>

1776
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:57,182
<i>about Doctor Strange,
the comic book character,</i>

1777
01:38:57,266 --> 01:39:00,352
<i>was that he was
this kind of lonely, heroic figure.</i>

1778
01:39:00,436 --> 01:39:04,690
<i>It's part of
what makes some superheroes great.</i>

1779
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:06,442
<i>Some of them
are more social and connected</i>

1780
01:39:06,525 --> 01:39:08,110
<i>and have love interests and all that.</i>

1781
01:39:08,193 --> 01:39:12,281
<i>And Strange certainly gets that with
Clea, who's Dormammu's daughter,</i>

1782
01:39:12,364 --> 01:39:13,657
<i>if you don't know the comics.</i>

1783
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:18,621
<i>But at this point in the story,</i>

1784
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:21,415
<i>he says he's willing to do this forever.</i>

1785
01:39:21,498 --> 01:39:22,916
<i>He's willing to suffer...</i>

1786
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,879
<i>And suffer in this moment endlessly
if he has to.</i>

1787
01:39:26,962 --> 01:39:30,591
<i>And that shows the ultimate,</i>

1788
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:36,722
<i>I think, pinnacle of
his emotional and spiritual growth.</i>

1789
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:40,768
<i>That he has evolved beyond
the person that he was completely.</i>

1790
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:43,228
<i>And he has evolved into a superhero.</i>

1791
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:46,732
<i>He's evolved into somebody
who represents the best of humanity.</i>

1792
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:48,942
<i>And because the best of humanity
is precisely that.</i>

1793
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:51,987
<i>It is love, it is self-sacrifice,</i>

1794
01:39:52,071 --> 01:39:57,326
<i>it is willingness to put the needs
of others ahead of oneself.</i>

1795
01:39:57,409 --> 01:39:59,370
<i>And that's what he does here.</i>

1796
01:39:59,453 --> 01:40:03,499
<i>And that's so far from the guy
that he was at the beginning.</i>

1797
01:40:03,582 --> 01:40:08,754
<i>And the challenge of the movie,
fundamentally, was to tell that story.</i>

1798
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:13,092
<i>To tell the story of that character arc
in less than two hours,</i>

1799
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,135
<i>because I didn't
want the movie to be long.</i>

1800
01:40:15,302 --> 01:40:19,264
<i>And to do it
with these big mind-bending</i>

1801
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:22,351
<i>psychedelic visual effects sequences.</i>

1802
01:40:22,434 --> 01:40:26,146
<i>And I think that we did that.</i>

1803
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:29,858
<i>Again, getting back to the thing
I started this commentary with,</i>

1804
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:31,610
<i>about hitting your target.</i>

1805
01:40:31,694 --> 01:40:33,904
<i>I don't know
how the movie's gonna do critically.</i>

1806
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:36,365
<i>I don't even know how audiences
are gonna respond to it.</i>

1807
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:38,367
<i>I know how
the test audiences responded to it,</i>

1808
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:40,289
<i>which is they love Benedict,
they love the movie.</i>

1809
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:43,414
<i>It all seemed very positive.</i>

1810
01:40:43,497 --> 01:40:44,498
<i>Um...</i>

1811
01:40:44,915 --> 01:40:49,086
<i>I don't know how it's gonna
do financially in the States or globally.</i>

1812
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:53,173
<i>All I know is that
I did hit the target I was aiming for.</i>

1813
01:40:53,257 --> 01:40:54,553
<i>This is the movie I set out to make.</i>

1814
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:58,470
<i>And as long as I've done that,
it's very satisfying.</i>

1815
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:01,432
<i>The last movie that I made,</i>
Deliver Us from Evil,

1816
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:04,560
<i>I hit the target on that movie, too.
I actually liked that movie.</i>

1817
01:41:04,643 --> 01:41:07,312
<i>And it was the movie I wanted it to be.</i>

1818
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:08,692
<i>It didn't do well financially,</i>

1819
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:10,983
<i>and it definitely
didn't do well critically,</i>

1820
01:41:11,066 --> 01:41:12,901
<i>and it never particularly bothered me</i>

1821
01:41:12,985 --> 01:41:16,947
<i>because the audiences
that I knew saw it, did respond to it.</i>

1822
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:19,241
<i>I watched audiences watch it.</i>

1823
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,577
<i>And they really dug it.
They got what they paid for.</i>

1824
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:23,162
<i>And I liked it.</i>

1825
01:41:23,245 --> 01:41:25,914
<i>But in this case,
this is a much bigger audience,</i>

1826
01:41:25,998 --> 01:41:27,791
<i>much broader audience.</i>

1827
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:31,503
<i>I want everybody who pays
to see the movie to like it.</i>

1828
01:41:31,587 --> 01:41:33,922
<i>I love this laugh
from Benny Wong.</i>

1829
01:41:34,006 --> 01:41:37,926
<i>Benedict Wong
goes by Benny in person.</i>

1830
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:43,015
<i>And every time I watch this scene,
his laugh is so infectious,</i>

1831
01:41:43,098 --> 01:41:46,185
<i>and it just kills me every time.</i>

1832
01:41:46,268 --> 01:41:52,816
<i>Benny's a very noble,
dignified kind of guy,</i>

1833
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:56,278
<i>and there's just something
about that,</i>

1834
01:41:56,361 --> 01:42:01,116
<i>the gregarious nature of that laugh,
every time I hear it,</i>

1835
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,827
<i>both for the character of Wong
and for Benny himself,</i>

1836
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:05,496
<i>it cracks me up.</i>

1837
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:09,166
<i>But what a great actor he is,</i>

1838
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:12,920
<i>and thank goodness
he agreed to do the movie.</i>

1839
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:14,922
<i>Now, this last little bit,</i>

1840
01:42:15,005 --> 01:42:17,716
<i>again, it really shows the difference
between Mordo and Strange.</i>

1841
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,885
<i>And again,
I don't think Mordo's wrong here.</i>

1842
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:21,970
<i>I do think there's a price to pay.</i>

1843
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:26,812
<i>I've used the reference actually</i>

1844
01:42:26,892 --> 01:42:31,814
<i>in regards to changing the race
of the Ancient One.</i>

1845
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:36,652
<i>I feel like I chose the lesser evil
by not casting an Asian.</i>

1846
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:40,239
<i>But choosing the lesser evil
is still choosing an evil.</i>

1847
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:42,825
<i>Which is why
some people have legitimate reasons</i>

1848
01:42:42,908 --> 01:42:44,743
<i>to be upset by it.</i>

1849
01:42:44,827 --> 01:42:50,541
<i>And the criticism
has some validity to it.</i>

1850
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,502
<i>And Mordo's point here at the end of,</i>

1851
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:56,296
<i>"You think there'll be no price to pay
for breaking the rules here?"</i>

1852
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,342
<i>"There's always a reckoning."</i>

1853
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:59,424
<i>I think there's some truth
to his point of view.</i>

1854
01:42:59,508 --> 01:43:01,468
<i>But it's too rigid.</i>

1855
01:43:01,552 --> 01:43:03,846
<i>Mordo's point.
Mordo's point of view is too rigid.</i>

1856
01:43:03,929 --> 01:43:06,181
<i>Too inflexible.</i>

1857
01:43:06,265 --> 01:43:09,685
<i>And that's
the nature of fundamentalism.</i>

1858
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:12,604
<i>That's the nature of close-mindedness.</i>

1859
01:43:12,688 --> 01:43:16,483
<i>And in the end, I believe in rules.</i>

1860
01:43:16,567 --> 01:43:19,695
<i>I believe in truth versus falsehood.</i>

1861
01:43:19,778 --> 01:43:22,531
<i>I believe in right and wrong.</i>

1862
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:28,370
<i>But I also believe that all things
are relative to varying degrees,</i>

1863
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:30,956
<i>depending on the circumstances.</i>

1864
01:43:31,915 --> 01:43:34,376
<i>This is the scene
I was talking about earlier.</i>

1865
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:37,546
<i>Just really loving seeing
the two of them together at the end,</i>

1866
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:38,964
<i>it seems so right.</i>

1867
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:41,133
<i>And as a Doctor Strange fan, um...</i>

1868
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:43,886
<i>It's pretty great</i>

1869
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:46,722
<i>that we're ending the movie
with just Wong and Strange.</i>

1870
01:43:46,805 --> 01:43:48,515
<i>That feels very much like the comics.</i>

1871
01:43:48,599 --> 01:43:50,893
<i>That after the story's been told,</i>

1872
01:43:50,976 --> 01:43:54,187
<i>going back to the Sanctum
is Wong and Strange.</i>

1873
01:43:54,271 --> 01:43:58,317
<i>But again, the roles are inverted,
in that Wong is still the teacher.</i>

1874
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,860
<i>Wong is still the master.</i>

1875
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:04,323
<i>And Strange
is not a Sorcerer Supreme.</i>

1876
01:44:04,406 --> 01:44:10,329
<i>He's a guy who's got a lot to learn
and has a long way to go.</i>

1877
01:44:12,331 --> 01:44:14,374
<i>I love this next image,</i>

1878
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:17,836
<i>which we shot in slow motion,</i>

1879
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,005
<i>specifically thinking
that it was a trailer shot.</i>

1880
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,258
<i>I remember just kinda
seeing this image</i>

1881
01:44:23,342 --> 01:44:25,218
<i>as I walked up the stairs one day.</i>

1882
01:44:25,302 --> 01:44:28,221
<i>And I told Ben Davis,
"I think we need to do</i>"

1883
01:44:28,305 --> 01:44:30,641
<i>"a slow-motion shot of Strange
going up these stairs,"</i>

1884
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:33,518
<i>which we ended up
using twice in the movie.</i>

1885
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:35,520
<i>And it doesn't feel overplayed.</i>

1886
01:44:35,604 --> 01:44:37,276
<i>It was in the trailer,
and it's in the movie twice,</i>

1887
01:44:37,356 --> 01:44:39,316
<i>and yet, it still works.</i>

1888
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:42,277
<i>This metaphor of the watch,
this symbolism of the watch,</i>

1889
01:44:42,361 --> 01:44:45,238
<i>it's a little heavy, but it works for me.</i>

1890
01:44:45,322 --> 01:44:48,867
<i>Sometimes, symbols work
with their directness,</i>

1891
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:50,327
<i>rather than their indirectness.</i>

1892
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:52,416
<i>Just the broken watch.
That Strange is still scarred.</i>

1893
01:44:52,496 --> 01:44:55,165
<i>He's still broken.
His hands still tremble.</i>

1894
01:44:55,415 --> 01:45:01,630
<i>He still carries the brokenness
that is himself with him.</i>

1895
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:03,382
<i>But that's part of what makes him</i>

1896
01:45:03,465 --> 01:45:06,385
<i>humble enough
to become a great sorcerer,</i>

1897
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,887
<i>and channel magic.</i>

1898
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:20,524
<i>These end credits
are pretty impressive</i>

1899
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:23,819
<i>given the short amount of time
that Sarofsky, the visual effects house,</i>

1900
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:25,278
<i>had to do them.</i>

1901
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:28,740
<i>They had very little time
to do these end credits.</i>

1902
01:45:35,664 --> 01:45:39,042
<i>What I like about it
is that they're interesting</i>

1903
01:45:39,126 --> 01:45:42,504
<i>and they're visually cool to watch, but
they keep you looking at the credits.</i>

1904
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:46,008
<i>They're not so distracting
that you don't read the names</i>

1905
01:45:46,091 --> 01:45:47,346
<i>or don't want to read the names.</i>

1906
01:45:47,426 --> 01:45:53,056
<i>They're intended to
put attention on the various credits.</i>

1907
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:57,853
<i>Michael Giacchino wrote the score
for the opening theme, by the way.</i>

1908
01:45:57,936 --> 01:46:00,856
<i>That's worth mentioning
that the Marvel logo theme</i>

1909
01:46:00,939 --> 01:46:02,774
<i>has its own theme,</i>

1910
01:46:02,858 --> 01:46:04,196
<i>which was written
by Michael Giacchino,</i>

1911
01:46:04,276 --> 01:46:08,280
<i>and that'll be the continuing
Marvel theme throughout other movies.</i>

1912
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,198
<i>I'm gonna sign off now.</i>

1913
01:46:10,282 --> 01:46:13,368
<i>I'll just say two things
about the last two tags.</i>

1914
01:46:13,452 --> 01:46:16,580
<i>One is that
the Thor sequence was not shot by me,</i>

1915
01:46:16,663 --> 01:46:19,041
<i>so I'm not gonna
do commentary track for it,</i>

1916
01:46:19,124 --> 01:46:23,295
<i>because that was shot by Taika,
the director of</i> Thor: Ragnarok.

1917
01:46:23,378 --> 01:46:27,507
<i>And the last scene with Mordo,
I think speaks for itself.</i>

1918
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:31,762
<i>And that's it from me
and</i> Doctor Strange.

1919
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,638
<i>Thanks very much for listening.</i>

1920
01:46:37,142 --> 01:46:40,604
<i>So Earth has wizards now, huh?</i>

1921
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:43,440
Tea?

1922
01:46:44,066 --> 01:46:45,484
I don't drink tea.

1923
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,651
What do you drink?

1924
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:49,237
Not tea.

1925
01:46:52,699 --> 01:46:54,367
So, I keep a watch list...

1926
01:46:54,534 --> 01:46:56,244
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1927
01:46:56,328 --> 01:46:57,728
that may be a threat to this world.

1928
01:46:57,954 --> 01:47:01,625
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1929
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:05,545
Worthy inclusion.

1930
01:47:05,712 --> 01:47:06,880
Yeah.

1931
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:12,052
So why bring him here to New York?

1932
01:47:12,219 --> 01:47:13,637
It's a bit of a long story.

1933
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:15,722
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1934
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:17,724
But we're looking for my father.

1935
01:47:18,183 --> 01:47:21,269
Oh, okay.
So if you found Odin...

1936
01:47:21,436 --> 01:47:24,523
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1937
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:25,941
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1938
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,526
Great!

1939
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:30,612
Allow me to help you.

1940
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:32,807
Can I help you?

1941
01:53:34,058 --> 01:53:37,187
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1942
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,732
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1943
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:43,067
Mordo.

1944
01:53:45,904 --> 01:53:47,655
So what can I do for you, man?

1945
01:53:47,822 --> 01:53:49,491
I've been away
for many months now,

1946
01:53:49,574 --> 01:53:51,576
and I've had a revelation.

1947
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:54,913
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1948
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:57,916
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1949
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:00,376
stealing power...

1950
01:54:01,085 --> 01:54:02,712
perverting nature.

1951
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:04,714
Like you.

1952
01:54:05,548 --> 01:54:07,926
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1953
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,511
Mine.

1954
01:54:09,761 --> 01:54:10,762
Power...

1955
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:13,723
has a purpose.

1956
01:54:27,612 --> 01:54:29,739
Why are you doing this?

1957
01:54:29,906 --> 01:54:33,243
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1958
01:54:38,456 --> 01:54:40,708
Too many sorcerers.
