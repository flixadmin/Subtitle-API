1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,725
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,843
<i>You're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.</i>

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,088
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,526
It's the fault of only one man.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,767
<i>And we're going to stop him.</i>

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,161
Do you remember what I promised you?

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,367
A new beginning.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,686
And you will have it.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,925
<i>I've seen
what he can do with his powers.</i>

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,850
<i>But when he tried to use them on me,</i>

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,605
<i>it completely backfired.</i>

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,604
<i>And my bloodlust was gone.</i>

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,604
Help me figure out a way
to make that permanent.

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,967
One day, I will have my moment,

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,201
and I will kill you.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,526
Take her!

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,085
Take that away as well.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,006
The food attracts flies,
and I prefer my solitude.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,405
The pepper came from the garden.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,924
The garden grows strong,
even in your absence.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,490
Please try a bite.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
The mountain will be ours by morning.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,161
We must act quickly.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,528
The Usurper will return,
and with him, his followers.

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,687
Has the Lotus been found?

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,644
In Kyushu. It's well-guarded.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,764
So was this place upon a time.

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,201
Good news is that the burglar
is headed straight toward you.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,880
Bad news is that the burglar
is headed straight towards you.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,441
Freeze!

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,001
Where'd he learn to do that?

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,611
I'm thinking Cirque du Soleil.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,767
He's headed for the roof.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,406
Thank you, Black Canary.
That is your cue, Green Arrow and Speedy.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,722
- Is she...
- Overusing our code names?

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,445
Yeah. Indulge her.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,971
We got him, Overwatch.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,169
You have no idea
how much I love hearing that.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,811
<i>I think we do, actually.</i>

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,407
<i>Two rooftop doors.</i>

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,443
Floor plans show that the staircase
splits a level below you.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,966
He could come out either door.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,846
Got him.

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,926
Speedy!

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,727
FELICITYI How's Thea?

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,042
She's okay.
She's resting at our place.

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,401
She said it was just exhaustion.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,886
We don't believe a word of that, do we?

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,081
What else could it be?

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,681
The Pit.

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,887
The bloodlust makes her feral,
it doesn't make her lose consciousness.

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,287
- And Thea hasn't gone aggro in months.
- Exactly.

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,567
Maybe this is some sort of side-effect

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,966
of her white-knuckling her way through it.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,571
It still seems like a bit of a leap.

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,526
Ollie, what are you thinking?

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,528
That I should have done a betterjob
of keeping an eye on her.

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,566
She told me the bloodlust came back
two months ago and I didn't even know.

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,048
I've been focused on the campaign,
and I've been...

60
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,562
Running back and forth
to Central City and...

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,084
How is it that you always manage to
blame yourself for everything?

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,522
That's his superpower. Guilt Arrow.

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,368
Did our thief steal anything else
from AmerTek?

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,561
A network mapper.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,404
A piece of tech designed to scan

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,723
all nearby digital infrastructure
for potential vulnerabilities.

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,046
Do we think it's his last score?

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,605
We better hope that it is.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,731
AmerTek's one of the last
viable businesses left in Star City.

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,400
Turns out, Palmer Tech is
one of those "viable businesses."

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,090
For now, at least.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,446
What do you mean, "For now?"

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,130
The board, in their infinite wisdom,

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,691
decided to move the presentation of

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,326
Curtis' world-changing tech
from April to now.

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,330
And guess who gets to be the
face of that potential disaster?

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,967
Oh, well, do you want me to come with you?
A little moral support.

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,766
- No. I'll be fine. It's just a dry run.
- Okay.

79
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,244
<i>Uh, in the past 30 years,</i>

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,523
<i>battery technology has been
at a virtual standstill,</i>

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,402
<i>with batteries lasting no longer than
they did in the 19703...</i>

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,726
Damn it.

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>But Palmer Tech's Power Cell</i>

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,082
<i>represents</i> a <i>major breakthrough...</i>

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,803
Sorry. I should've gone with
overhead projector.

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,601
Mr. Holt, could you give us
the room, please?

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,165
Well, actually, that's gonna be
a little difficult

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,362
seeing as how the entire building's
a property of...

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,650
I just... I'll be right outside.

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,761
Sorry.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,966
- Felicity.
- Mmm-hmm.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,209
May I be uncomfortably honest?

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,281
Well, you have never shown
an inability to do so before.

94
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,521
Right.

95
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,121
This company has been
flirting with bankruptcy

96
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,970
since before you returned to Star City.

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,844
And your injury...

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Well, it didn't exactly help
our stock price.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,606
We stake the future of Palmer Tech
on this Power Cell.

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,609
We need to put our best foot forward.

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,645
Well, that is not something
I'm exactly able to do right now.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,201
- But...
- Sorry.

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,846
Poor choice of words.

104
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
What I mean is...

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,686
Perhaps it'd be better to let someone else
do this presentation.

106
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,727
And by "someone else,"
you mean someone not in a wheelchair.

107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,527
This is about doing
what's best for the company.

108
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Anything less than a perfect launch
and we are sunk.

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,650
Right. You're right.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,806
Please let the board know.

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,287
Hey-

112
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,449
Just wanted to check in,
see how you were doing.

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,564
Why, I'd think the answer to
that question is fairly self-evident.

114
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,048
Thea's bloodlust is
the balancing of an equation.

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,129
She was given life
and now she needs to take it.

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,402
Malcolm, we know that already.
What we don't know is why...

117
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,766
What you don't know.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,930
What I didn't know until Thea collapsed

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,125
is that, if the life she
owes doesn't come from taking others,

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,322
it will come from the life of the host.

121
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,564
Please do not refer to me as "the host."

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,886
This isn't a joke.

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,086
If you don't indulge this bloodlust,
you will die.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,402
I don't understand. Sara wasn't like this.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,083
John Constantine made Sara whole
and restored the balance.

126
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,324
Thea, I thought you were doing okay.

127
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,410
Because the bloodlust was
temporarily blunted.

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,727
By What?

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,601
Damien Darhk.

130
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,962
When we rescued Andy from HIVE,
Iran into him.

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,603
He tried to kill me
with his magic death touch thingy,

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,928
but it didn't work on me.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,963
What it did do was stop the bloodlust.

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,650
For a time.

135
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,921
We need to find Damien Darhk,

136
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,645
and make whatever he did to her permanent.

137
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,251
Oliver,
even if that were possible,

138
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,290
even if you caught Damien
in a more cooperative mood,

139
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,289
he and his HIVE have gone to ground.

140
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,845
Or haven't you noticed?

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,041
- Yeah.
- Our sticky-fingered friend

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,765
just pulled anotherjob at Cadmus Tech.

143
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,604
He's two blocks east of you, headed south.

144
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,761
John, I can't right now.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,206
He stole a weapon this time.

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,726
Just go.
Nothing is gonna change here in an hour.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,087
I'm on my way.

148
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,561
Where am I looking?

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,211
<i>We're working on it.</i>

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,005
Got him!

151
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,486
Roy?

152
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,850
First Sara, then Ray,
then John's brother...

153
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,202
Whose shocking return
can we look forward to next?

154
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,164
Oliver, I'm gonna ask this just to ask it.

155
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,890
- Are you sure that it was...
- It was Roy. Absolutely.

156
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,286
Or maybe it was just somebody

157
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,369
who's able to
make themselves look like Roy.

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,284
Don't act like
it's the craziest possibility

159
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,045
after everything that we've experienced.

160
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,050
What's "crazy" is Roy stealing
from tech companies.

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,321
What did he take this time?

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,888
Triode capacitor bomb.
Tiny device, really huge boom.

163
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,250
It's Alex for the 500th time today.

164
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,281
OLIVER; Hey.

165
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,966
Hey, I was just texting you.

166
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,563
- How did you not...
- Oh.

167
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,041
- Campaign office has a secret elevator.
- What?

168
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,723
I'm kidding.
I came in the side to avoid the media.

169
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,046
Got your nine-one-one.
Everything all right?

170
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,241
No. Not really.

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,647
Ledger's going to press with it tomorrow,
but we got a heads up.

172
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,251
Someone else is
throwing their hat in the ring.

173
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,250
- Who?
- Political novice, it looks like.

174
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,562
Still working up a bio,
but she seems to have come out of nowhere

175
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,366
to suddenly have a campaign office
in Pennytown.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,967
Ruvé Adams.

177
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,208
Do you know her from somewhere?

178
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,801
No. I'm just surprised
to have an opponent.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,047
Yeah.

180
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,163
Well, it's pretty much a game-changer.

181
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,761
Yes, it is.

182
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,481
I've never doubted
your resiliency, Mr. Queen.

183
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,960
But you will tell me.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,365
Why did you need these maps?

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,642
He can't tell you anything
if you kill him!

186
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,126
Get her out of here!

187
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,410
No!

188
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,885
What did your tattoos reveal, hmm?

189
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,325
What were you trying to find?

190
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,001
Hello, Oliver.

191
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,170
It's good to see you again.

192
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,850
Are you here to endorse me?

193
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,610
I want a meeting with your husband.

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,526
I'm not sure you would survive
another "meeting" with my husband.

195
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,125
No fight this time.

196
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,490
I have a proposition for him.

197
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,886
I'm listening.

198
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,562
Tomorrow, 10:30. Kershaw and Eighth.

199
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,809
Uh, we have a new problem.

200
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,010
I was going over the schematics
of the two pieces of stolen tech,

201
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,202
trying to figure out
where Roy was going to hit next...

202
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,367
Any luck?

203
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,840
No, I mean not at first.

204
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,407
A capacitor bomb and a network mapper,
that's like...

205
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,005
Ceiling fan and broccoli.

206
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,521
- Sounds like a messy combination.
- Combination being the breakthrough.

207
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,451
I stopped trying to figure out
what the two pieces of tech had in common

208
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,166
and started working on what would happen
if they were combined somehow.

209
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,526
Their components, specifically.

210
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,687
Tell us something good.

211
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,245
It depends on your definition of "good."

212
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,727
But I'm pretty sure that
AmerTek's network mapper

213
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,447
and Cadmus' capacitor could theoretically
be used to create a web-nuke.

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,081
Like a bomb?

215
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,247
Roy already stole a bomb.

216
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,364
No, lam talking about a device
that can destroy the entire Internet.

217
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,042
We're talking banking systems,
nuclear arsenals, power grids...

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,402
Last year,
Roy could barely spell computer.

219
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,889
Even assuming
he did build this device, I...

220
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,889
- Why hasn't he used it?
- Because it's incomplete.

221
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,004
A device like this needs a really
substantial power source to run off of.

222
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,730
And guess what company in Star City

223
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,446
just invented the next generation
revolutionary battery?

224
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,407
I don't wanna hurt you.

225
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,647
I don't want you to hurt me either.

226
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
Well, I'm gonna need to take that.

227
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,287
Oh...

228
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,845
I think you might have to hurt me, then.

229
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,330
Roy, stand down.

230
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,131
There's something wrong with him.

231
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,731
Yeah, I think that's been established.

232
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,251
Let's talk about this, Roy.

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
<i>Drone is in position.</i>

234
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,089
Roy. Roy, what are you doing?

235
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,371
Listen very carefully.

236
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,808
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Do it.

237
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,006
No, wait!

238
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,011
What did you do?

239
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,846
Take out the tranq, carefully.

240
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,328
Let's hope the Faraday cage
Cisco installed in here works.

241
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,646
A what?

242
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,601
Basically a shield for everything
broadcast and electromagnetic.

243
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,962
- Which eye did you see the tech in?
- The right one.

244
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,846
How'd you even know he had it?

245
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,007
Roy's eyes are blue.

246
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,009
I'm guessing this was transmitting
an AV signal,

247
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,725
probably to
whoever was picking up the tech.

248
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,445
Well, he can tell us when he wakes up.

249
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,761
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

250
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,568
We took out the contact. We made it
look like we killed you. You're safe.

251
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,410
While I'm in here, at least.

252
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,442
New lair. Nice.

253
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,123
I heard about what happened. I'm sorry.

254
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,484
Roy, what happened to you?

255
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,001
I got made.

256
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,404
I was in Hub City.
A new life, new name. Everything.

257
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,365
- And then I got an e-mail.
- Saying, what?

258
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,846
Steal a bunch of stuff?

259
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,610
Or he'll expose me as Roy Harper.

260
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,401
Suddenly, the Arrow's not dead anymore.

261
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,171
And then the police,
they'd be looking at you. Again.

262
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,361
Who's the blackmailer?

263
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,002
I don't know. I've never met him.
But he calls himself The Calculator.

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,567
This is what happens
when the bad guys name themselves.

265
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,081
- Roy, you should've come to us sooner.
- I couldn't.

266
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,129
He's right.
There's a camera built into this.

267
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,441
This is really incredible tech.

268
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,246
He could see every single move I made,
every person I talk to.

269
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,680
I couldn't just expose you guys like that.

270
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,325
We would've figured something out.

271
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,602
- This is my problem.
- 'Cause you were solving my problem.

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,404
<i>Okay, well our problem is that</i>

273
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,683
The Calculator now has everything he needs
to melt the Internet.

274
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,847
I love the Internet.

275
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,242
Which means we have to find him. Fast.

276
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,410
Can you back-trace the components
and figure out where that broadcasts to?

277
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,887
- Girl, you read my mind.
- Pop yourjacket off, I'll patch you up.

278
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,844
Man, I cannot believe you shot me.

279
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,921
Really?

280
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,127
Mei?

281
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,481
<i>Shade.</i>

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,121
Shado's dead.

283
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,530
I know. You're having a vision.
The result of your injuries.

284
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,886
You're not real?

285
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,361
No.

286
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,444
But what I've come to tell you is.

287
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,450
What have you come to tell me?

288
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,562
You need to forgive yourself
for what you've done.

289
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,761
Unfortunately, you're gonna
have to be a little bit more specific.

290
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,931
You had the chance to leave this island,
to return to your family.

291
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,804
They miss you terribly.

292
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,611
Can't go back to my family.

293
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,971
Not the way that I am now.

294
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,170
Then it's time to start changing.

295
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,690
The only way out is through, Oliver.

296
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,688
That's what Amanda Waller said.

297
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,486
Through what?

298
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,327
Through your own darkness. Let it go.

299
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,640
I don't know how.

300
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Then I will teach you.

301
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,527
This is it.

302
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,321
- I see no shrine.
- The woods are the shrine, Talibah.

303
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,082
In times long past, the people of Japan
found their gods in all things.

304
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,050
Nature was their temple.

305
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,681
I must do this alone.

306
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,122
If I do not return within the hour,
tell the others...

307
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,331
The war is over.

308
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,401
Hello, Tatsu.

309
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,881
You look well.

310
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,161
Being a member of the Crescent Order
clearly suits you.

311
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,165
I have found my purpose.
What is yours in Japan?

312
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,731
I've come for the Lotus.

313
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
It is my responsibility to keep it safe.

314
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,921
I know.

315
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,520
Unfortunate.

316
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,131
We're evenly matched.

317
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,123
One of us must yield,
or this will go on for ages.

318
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,805
I have nowhere else to be.

319
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,641
I do.

320
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,087
In a matter that concerns Oliver Queen.

321
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,040
I see two options.

322
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,086
We keep fighting
until one of us drops from exhaustion.

323
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,481
Or we lay down our swords,
and you listen to what I have to say.

324
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,328
Maybe next time, we can
do something that doesn't involve

325
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,841
me getting stabbed or shot at.
Justanidea.

326
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,290
I'm sorry that I put you in this position.

327
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,443
I'm pretty sure I put myself
in this position.

328
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,607
Man...

329
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,801
I remember you not being all that happy

330
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,485
that I faked my death
to protect your secret.

331
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,920
I never should have let you.

332
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,005
Do you ever get tired?

333
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,247
You know carrying the weight of the world

334
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,487
on your shoulders like that all the time?

335
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,091
You sound like Felicity.

336
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,726
And Diggle.

337
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,166
Well, great minds.

338
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,603
So what are Felicity and John saying
you're taking responsibility for now?

339
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,601
Thea?

340
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,801
Oh, my God.

341
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,210
Am I hallucinating?

342
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,001
It's really you.

343
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,726
How are you?

344
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,611
I've been better. Um...

345
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,206
How are you?

346
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,211
Where have you been?

347
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,204
What are you doing here?

348
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,407
How long are you... Here...

349
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,443
(Thea“.Thea! 4COUGHWG)

350
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,201
What's happening?

351
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,368
I don't... I don't know.

352
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,370
- Oh, my God...
- it's the wound. From Ra's.

353
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,807
- I'll call nine-one-one.
- No, doctors can't help her.

354
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,170
Stay with us, Thea. Stay strong.
Give it a minute. It will pass.

355
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,166
You're okay.

356
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,241
<i>How's it going?</i>

357
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,530
This tiny piece of plastic
has more computing power in it

358
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,841
than most high-end laptops.

359
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,441
I have half a mind to
reverse engineer it for Palmer Tech.

360
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,727
But first...

361
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,969
Yes, I found a tiny flaw in the O.S. code

362
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,889
and I'm pretty sure I can exploit it to

363
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,651
open a back door
into his main computer system.

364
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,763
Right, but wouldn't that
risk exposing us?

365
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,529
My pride that you understood
what I was saying is slightly undercut

366
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,085
by your lack of faith in me.

367
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,881
I have nothing but faith. Just do it.

368
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,566
I already did.

369
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,761
<i>Well, Well...</i>

370
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,843
Whoever you are, let me just say,
I am very impressed.

371
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,289
<i>No one's ever been able to break through
my encryption before.</i>

372
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,686
Bravo.

373
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,126
Disguise your voice.

374
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,887
Thanks.

375
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,127
<i>I would take that
as</i> a <i>compliment</i>

376
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,449
<i>if it wasn't coming from some nut-job
who's trying to destroy the Internet.</i>

377
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,609
Why would I want to take down the 'net?

378
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,331
Not only is it where I work,
I'm addicted to funny cat videos.

379
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,688
Well, if you're not trying to
take down the Internet,

380
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,450
what do you need a web-nuke for?

381
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,684
<i>Very clever.
Keeping me talking to buy you time to</i>

382
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,649
breach my firewall.

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,606
<i>So that's a pass on telling me
your evil plan?</i>

384
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,245
Let's put it this way.

385
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,644
If you wanna make a statement,
you don't take down the system.

386
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,802
You take down a city.

387
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,209
Damn it! He shut me out.

388
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,243
Not before indicating
what his plan might be.

389
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,688
How do you take down a...

390
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,804
Oh, no...

391
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,967
What?

392
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,731
Well, I've been thinking
about what would happen

393
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,843
if he used the web-nuke
to take down the Internet,

394
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,849
but if you used it right...

395
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,561
Overloading the electrical grid,
shutting down hospital equipment,

396
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,410
causing water main breaks...

397
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,402
He... He could kill everyone in the city.

398
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,807
So a web-nuke needs to be
deployed somewhere...

399
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,003
We need to know
where The Calculator wants to install it.

400
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,929
I am not calling him that on principle.

401
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,009
Because it is a lame codename.

402
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,486
Okay, Felicity,
but we still have to check...

403
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,485
I am conducting a review of all the nodes,
sub-nodes, and network access points

404
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,564
where the web-nuke
would do the most damage.

405
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,609
- Any luck?
- Why do you always ask me that?

406
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,290
If I had any luck looking for
what I'm looking for,

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,761
I would be telling you about it
instead of looking for it!

408
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,248
Sorry. Stressed.

409
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,121
In addition to our lunatic of the week,
I have Palmer Tech to look after.

410
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,881
Palmer Tech. Ray worked up something
last year called a battering ram,

411
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,043
basically something that could crash
through cyber security.

412
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
No commercial application, but...

413
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,808
Can you use it to get back
into The Calculator's system?

414
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,929
Stop calling him that. I'm serious.

415
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,444
Your darkness is guilt.

416
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,884
You've taken many lives.

417
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,406
The life of your love's brother
most recently.

418
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,848
I'm not in love with Taiana.

419
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,286
She helped you recover the maps
from the Amazo,

420
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,363
she nursed you back to health

421
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,884
and all she's received from you in return
is a lie.

422
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,886
Open your eyes.

423
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,126
What's this?

424
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
Curtis Holt,
have you seen the battering ram?

425
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,966
It's this kickass piece of tech
that Ray invented last year.

426
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,083
Um, cylindrical shape, titanium shell.

427
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,408
- I'm gearing up for a brute force attack.
- Look out for that...

428
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,166
And I need all the firepower I can muster.

429
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,931
Stool... Uh, never mind.

430
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,244
Hey, you've gotten pretty slick
on that thing in the last 24 hours.

431
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,447
What happened?

432
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,881
Yes! I got it.

433
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,209
- Thanks, Curtis. You're the best.
- I <i>didn't</i> do anything.

434
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,767
You're the one who's whipping around here
like a house on fire.

435
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,531
Well, that is what happens
when the entire city is at stake.

436
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,087
But not when it's just, say,
an entire company.

437
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,930
Mr. Dennis says you're no longer
presenting the Power Cell to the Board?

438
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,565
Well, my dry run was an epic disaster.

439
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,689
Yeah. I know, it was.

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,201
It was a spectacular failure.
Like, it was really bad.

441
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,243
- Okay.
- But it wouldn't have been

442
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,771
if this Felicity had come in.

443
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,769
You know, the one who wheels in here,

444
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,962
kicking ass and taking names
like you just did.

445
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,366
No, this is different.

446
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,330
No, it's not.

447
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,449
There's two Felicitys, Felicity.

448
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,042
The one in that boardroom,
whose wheelchair makes her doubt herself.

449
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,406
And this Felicity.

450
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,241
Brilliant force of nature.

451
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,566
This company needs the second Felicity.

452
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,640
Hey-

453
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,445
Laurel told me.

454
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,561
You Okay?

455
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,570
I'm feeling a bit better.

456
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,003
Hey, I'm working on something.

457
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,130
If it's a pedophile for me to kill,

458
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,767
Malcolm's already been
pitching that one hard.

459
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,285
You're not a killer, Thea.

460
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,965
That's not a way for you to live.

461
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,241
But it sounds like Damien Darhk might be.

462
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,640
Yeah, I'm sure
he's just itching to do us a favor.

463
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,002
We're gonna find out.
I arranged a meeting.

464
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,964
It's not like he's gonna be
willing to help me.

465
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,770
Maybe there's something that he wants.

466
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,811
- Something I can trade him.
- Ollie, that's insane.

467
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,963
Not to mention stupid. I...

468
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,451
I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.

469
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,608
And I can't let you die.

470
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,361
I won't.

471
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,487
That's not up to you.

472
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,568
Look, I know how you take everything on,
everyone's problems.

473
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,521
It's one of the things
I love the most about you.

474
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,724
But you can't fix this one, Ollie.

475
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,481
I have to try.

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,721
<i>No, you don't.</i>

477
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,051
It's my choice.

478
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,731
It's my life.

479
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,927
She's stubborn, isn't she?

480
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,683
Definitely something she gets
from your side of the family.

481
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,847
It doesn't matter.

482
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,726
Because you're going to go,
hood in hand, to Damien Darhk?

483
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,760
I am the Demon's Head.

484
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
<i>I have my resources.</i>

485
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,007
And I know how to put my ear
up against a door.

486
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,605
Leaving the epic stupidity
of your plan aside...

487
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,921
Thea's right.

488
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,044
This isn't either of our decisions.

489
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,888
Malcolm, do you want her to die?

490
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,246
<i>Of course not.</i>

491
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,561
Do you have any idea how badly
I wanna put a knife in her hand

492
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,444
and force her to slit someone's throat?

493
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,604
I've come this close to dragging someone
in here for her to kill.

494
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,046
<i>And the reason I don't</i>

495
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,761
is because that would be about
my feelings and not Thea's.

496
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,961
Oliver, sometimes the greatest act of love
is no action at all.

497
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,442
<i>It's her life. It's her choice.</i>

498
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,609
This almost feels like cheating,
using Ray's tech to beat this guy.

499
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,243
Got it. He's installing the web-nuke
at Flint Hill's Data Farm.

500
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,084
- Installing?
- Yeah. He's doing it right now.

501
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,651
Get Oliver.

502
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,481
<i>Device is onsite.</i>

503
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
Dandy.

504
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,521
Hang on a sec...

505
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,886
Miss me?

506
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,290
I have seriously missed this.

507
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,481
Overwatch, we're on station.

508
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,647
<i>I'm trying to find the web-nuke,</i>

509
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,491
but our adversary knows I'm in his system
and he's trying to kick me out.

510
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,125
I did get a look at his protocols, though,

511
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,971
and if the web-nuke goes online,
he could kill 8,000 people.

512
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,884
<i>I'd say that's a conservative estimate.</i>

513
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,527
Blowing the gas mains alone
will kill 3,000.

514
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,246
Just wait till you see what I've got
planned for the subway cars...

515
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,921
Ooh, good story. Write me a letter.
From prison.

516
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,531
<i>The battering ram was a neat trick.</i>

517
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,202
But the only way you're going to stop me
is by removing the web-nuke on site.

518
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,843
And I suspect that you don't come out
from behind that keyboard much.

519
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,843
That's what I have friends for.

520
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,526
Okay, so does anyone know
how to disconnect this thing?

521
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,047
I brought friends too.

522
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,446
<i>Hired mercenaries.</i>

523
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,001
It's amazing who you can find
on the Dark Web.

524
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,243
Always gotta make an entrance, don't you?

525
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,046
Sorry. It was a meeting
that I decided not to go to.

526
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,120
Look,
I know it's been a while for me,

527
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,725
but this still isn't a good thing, right?

528
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,048
You know, I almost feel bad
about beating you.

529
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,885
Rarely do I get to meet someone
with your talents.

530
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,451
What did you do?

531
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,803
Boom! I believe the technical term
is I pwned you.

532
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,441
Be that as it may,
I can breach through the firewall faster

533
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,769
than I can remove the DRMs
off a Beatles tune.

534
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,610
Guys, the web-nuke is hard-wired in.

535
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,451
Not to get too inside baseball on you,
but I need you to blow the thing up.

536
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,766
How much time do we have?

537
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,930
It's a long story, but somewhere between
<i>I</i> Want To Hold Your <i>Hand</i> and Hey Jude.

538
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,925
Priming the explosive.
Something's not working...

539
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,485
He's jamming the detonation frequencies.

540
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,121
Okay. We do this the old fashioned way
and manually set the charge.

541
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,402
Yeah, but how do we do that
and get out of here in one piece?

542
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,925
Someone has to stay behind.

543
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,081
I'll do it.

544
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,925
Even if you trigger the C4 with an arrow
at a distance,

545
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,690
you still need to outrun the blast radius.

546
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,445
- I can do that.
- Yeah, just because you're wearing red

547
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,681
doesn't make you the Flash, Roy.

548
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,126
I didn't say it wasn't gonna be risky.

549
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,847
You just got a fresh start.
I don't want you to throw it all away.

550
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,128
I'm the one who brought this maniac
into your lives.

551
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,762
I need to do this.
This is my choice. It's my life.

552
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,441
Okay.

553
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,691
See you outside, kid.

554
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,841
Good luck.

555
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,521
Hey-

556
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,771
You run like hell.

557
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,966
Yeah.

558
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,726
You guys might wanna get out of here.

559
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,727
Come on, Roy. Come on!

560
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,091
Just like riding a bicycle.

561
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,689
It's good to have you back, Roy.
You've been missed.

562
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,600
Oh, don't get too used to me.

563
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,684
And I'm gonna have to
go underground again.

564
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,208
Even deeper
now that The Calculator knows who I am.

565
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,044
What's to keep him
from posting it on the Internet?

566
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,248
Oh, I might've installed
a virus in his system

567
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,249
that wiped out everything he had on Roy.

568
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,206
I'm sorry I can't stay.

569
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,411
Not just for you guys, but for Thea.

570
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,761
She'll understand.

571
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,530
She's gonna be okay, Oliver.

572
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,764
Well, whatever she decides,

573
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,360
I'm gonna back her play.

574
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,970
Thank God.
I thought the fever would never break.

575
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,884
- I'll get you some water.
- Taiana.

576
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,562
I need to tell you something.

577
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,961
It's okay.

578
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,484
Whatever it is, it can wait
until you've had some water.

579
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,767
I lied to you.

580
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,961
When I said that Conklin
killed your brother, that was a lie.

581
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,327
I don't understand.

582
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,767
I have this darkness inside of me

583
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,924
that I've been trying to escape
for the longest time.

584
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,163
And I think that I found a way
but first I need to earn your forgiveness.

585
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,841
For what?

586
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,602
I didn't know that Vlad was your brother.

587
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,443
There are reasons but they don't matter.

588
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,011
They don't change what I did.

589
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,646
I killed your brother.

590
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,604
No.

591
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,448
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

592
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,001
You are gonna be great. Break a leg.

593
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,641
Sorry.

594
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
Okay.

595
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,167
Hmm.

596
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,801
Welcome.

597
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,884
This is a day I have looked forward to
for a very long time.

598
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,330
Because today, I stand...

599
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,401
On the shoulders of many giants.

600
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,847
Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison,

601
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,366
Ray Palmer and, of course, Curtis Holt.

602
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,522
Their work has always been about
making this world a better place.

603
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,681
And today, we get to take another step
towards that goal.

604
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,521
As you know, battery technology has been
at a virtual standstill for decades,

605
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,481
with batteries lasting, nor charging,
any faster than they did in the 1970s.

606
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,840
Until now.

607
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,481
Today, Palmer Tech is pleased to
introduce the Power Cell.

608
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,411
A 100% recyclable battery.

609
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,849
It can charge an electric car
for thousands of miles.

610
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,483
And right now, it is single-handedly

611
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,201
not only powering
this entire presentation,

612
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,251
but this entire building.

613
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,524
She's something else, isn't she?

614
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,041
You have no idea.

615
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,887
You know, you should be a nurse
in your new life.

616
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,891
You're a natural.

617
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,730
Only problem is, I am a one-patient man.

618
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,210
And I am already committed to you.

619
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,085
Is that why you're leaving?

620
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,361
You know, I get it.

621
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,723
Star City is filled with too many people
who can recognize you.

622
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,647
You know, I thought about staying anyway.

623
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,886
<i>For you.</i>

624
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,921
You know what you could do? For me?

625
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,563
Go live an amazing life.

626
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,324
Get married, have a couple kids.

627
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,641
Yeah.

628
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,245
And get a minivan.

629
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,603
Just go be normal.

630
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,446
There's nothing in this world
that would make me happier than that.

631
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,607
You know,
if I could do all of this over again...

632
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,401
I would do every
single one of those things with you.

633
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,646
Me, too.

634
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,125
I love you, Thea Queen.

635
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,645
I love you, Roy Harper.

636
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,602
You were amazing out there.

637
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,844
Thanks. How's Thea doing?

638
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,321
I'm gonna go check on her now.

639
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,324
I'm just gonna debrief with Curtis,
but text me how she's doing, okay?

640
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,606
Okay.

641
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,291
Oh, my God.

642
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,641
Dad?

643
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,689
- How is she?
- Resting.

644
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,561
Where's your new BFF Damien?

645
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,006
I don't know.

646
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,005
Like you said, this is Thea's decision,
it's not mine.

647
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,204
Oliver, I know it feels wrong,
but you did the right thing.

648
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,086
However it feels,
I couldn't have done it without you.

649
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,522
Malcolm, thank you. For everything.

650
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,163
Oliver. It's Thea.

651
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,043
How long will she be in a coma?

652
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,690
Right now she's barely a three
on the Glasgow Scale.

653
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,685
The prognosis isn't good.
I'm sorry.

654
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,444
Thea, please, don't go.

655
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,284
There's only one way to prevent that.

656
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,126
My father once told me of an elixir
known as the Lotus.

657
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
Capable of countering
the effects of the Lazarus Pit,

658
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,762
a secret weapon developed by
the League's enemies.

659
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,128
- Do you have it?
- I do.

660
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,129
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

661
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,560
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

662
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,521
English SDH
