You've sold me. I think I'll give them
a second chance, then.

163
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm also a big fan
of giving things a second chance.

Look, another product
that's a hundred percent artificial.

[cashier] That'll be six eighty.

I'll see you around.

Ciao.

- Did you hurt yourself?
- [Alma] I'm fine, just a pimple.

175
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Let me see.

176
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,040
I know we're being harsh
with the grounding, Alma,

177
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,400
but you left us no other choice.

178
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,360
I already apologized.

179
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
What were you expecting?
That we wouldn't catch you?

180
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
That we wouldn't care you ran away?

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,040
Well, I don't know, okay?
I didn't think about it.

182
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,736
I just wanted to have fun at the party...

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
Well, we have to think
about the consequences of our actions.

184
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,400
Maybe we'll make a deal.

185
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
What type of deal?

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,160
- You take a drug test every week.
- [scoffs]

If it's negative and you focus
on your studies and help out at home,

188
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,480
you can get your phone back
and your money,

189
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,600
and we'll allow you
to go out on the weekends again.

190
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Got it?

191
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,640
And has Dad accepted these terms?

192
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,040
I don't care if he accepts them.

193
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
It's a deal.

194
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,920
We only have these left.

How are you holdin' up?

201
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,120
[Alma] Well, I'm grounded until I turn 30.

202
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,120
[Greta] You scared the life out of me.

Yeah, yeah. Um...

209

I think I might still be hungover,
or maybe the Molly's still getting to me.

I don't know.

211
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
What happened to you?

212
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,800
I left for one second
and... and you were just gone.

213
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,440
Mm, I guess,
I... I felt like walking and got lost?

214
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,600
I looked all over the damn place
and couldn't find you.

215
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
Where'd you go, Alma?

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't know, just around.

217
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I, um,

218
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,280
hopped on a bus
and fell asleep until the last stop.

219
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,840
So then I had to take
a different bus home, that's it.

220
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
Why didn't you call me?

221
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960

226
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
So, have you spoken to Alma?

227
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah, uh, she's doing fine.

228
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
Grounded for eternity, but fine.

229
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
Um, did she tell you what happened?

230
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,040
She says she started walking and got lost.

231
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,720
And then she just hopped onto a bus
and fell asleep for a while.

232
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,240
- What?
- There's just no way I believe that.

233
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,960
I mean, it sounds like total nonsense.

234
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah, but why would she lie to you?

235
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Hmm.

236
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,200

- Meh, don't sweat it.

Okay.

[father] You shouldn't've taken
your sister and Alma to that party.

249
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,080
I know, I'm sorry.

250
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
[Greta] It wasn't his fault.

251
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
It was my idea.

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
I thought that you were both mature enough

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,600
to comprehend the risk
this family's taking.

254

[David] We know, Mom.

255
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,600
[mother] Your sister was meant
to stay out of this.

256
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah, uh, thing is,
I've never really been out of it.

Not for a single day
or moment in the last four years.

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Greta,

259
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,040
we don't like the idea of having
a pot farm in the cellar, either.

260
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
We agreed to it
so we wouldn't lose the house.

261
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
But there are many nights when it feels
like the worst decision we've ever made.

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
All we want is to protect you.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
[gulps] Yeah, yeah. I know.

264
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,200
Just saying, I've been suffering
the consequences too.

265
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
- [father] Sure.
- Yeah.

266
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
[father] It's been hard for everyone.

267
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,760
But things may change very, very soon.

268
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,840
I have an interview lined up.

269
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
- What?
- Yes.

270
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,440
We weren't going to say anything,
but, well, I have a hunch this time.

271
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,200
Apparently, they need someone
with a profile in sales, like mine.

272
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
It's written for me.

273
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
And that's what
you were looking for, right?

274
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
It's what I wanted,
and the salary's pretty decent.

I'll go with you.</i>

<i>I mean it. I'm not leaving you alone.</i>

287
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
You would do that for me?

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
And for me.

289
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
I refuse to live without you.

291
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
They won't allow that, your parents.

- I don't wanna be all alone, Greta.
- [Greta] Don't be silly.

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,960
I... I swear you won't.

294
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,560
Wherever you go, I'll go too.

295
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,480
And wherever I go, you'll come with me.

296
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
No matter what.

297
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I love you.

298

299
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,440
[Pablo] They're not accurate tests.

300
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,480
[Vero] Honestly, I didn't think
it'd be a problem.

301
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
[Pablo] And you didn't check with me
before talking to her.

302
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,800
That's just great.

303
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,360
[Vero] Let's not get into how
each one of us handles things.

304
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,240
I don't know what happened.

305
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
I already apologized to you.

306
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,040
Yes, Pablo. But it's not me
you need to apologize to.

307
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,160
No, you're wrong.
It's got nothing to do with ego.

308
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Ah, shit, it terrifies me
to think about what could happen

if we don't properly handle it.

Aren't you scared?

311
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,520
You realize locking her in
will make her want to break out again.

312
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,160
And then we'll lose her permanently.

313

She's gonna let us down again.

How are the exam resits going?

00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,760
- Um, I'm studying.
- Good.

325

You still have time to pass the course.

I know you're perfectly capable
of doing it.

Well, after that, I got completely trashed
