78
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,511
when her children grom up they

79
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,917
every year 4 lacs applications

80
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,055
but only 200 persons selected

00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,533
my daughter also applied for 3 years

82
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,956
in space neither fountain nor
ink pen can be used

83
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,322
after spending million of dollars
scientists invented a pen

84
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,624
that can be used on any temperature

85
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:52,015

write on board

88
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:26,381
if fountain pen cant be used in space then
why they did not use pencil?

89
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,325
They could save million of dollars

90
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,043
whole day he tease teachers

91
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,849
if we live with him then we will
be in trouble

92
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,719
who will pay the fees?

93
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,099
Just wear the uniform and go to school

94
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,531

nobody will recognize you

95
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,102
and if we get caught then?

96
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,672
Change the uniform,

97
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,013

98
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,797
why are you laughing?

99
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,810
I'am very happy to be in engineering college

100
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,779

101
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,106

I told something in simple language
but you didn't understand

117
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,838
professors most of time
kept him outside class

118
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,208
whenever professors tell him to go outside

then he go to another class

120

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,900
you scare too much

147
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,954
there was a security guard in our village

148
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,718

151
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,522
one night there was a robbery in our village

152
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,794

no but you can have the power to
tolerate it

156
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,142
neither police knows,
nor Joy's father

157
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,843
everybody is thinking its a suicide

158
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,787
they are thinking he is died because
of tension

159
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,674
these engineers are very smart

160
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,877
its not a suicide.
Its a murder

161
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,850
you are blaming me for
Joy's suicide

162
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,358
I'm not blaming you

163
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,262
i'm talking about system

164
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,165

167
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,212

than disease

168
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,619

I bring this college to number one

170
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,371

171
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,966
aboutjobs in US

172
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,182

173
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,437
you have 30 seconds

174
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,841
you have to tell the meaning of
words written on board

175
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,111
you can also use the book

176
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,880
those who find the answers raise
his hand up

177
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,554
nobody found the answer?

178
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,961
Now rewind 1 minute of your life
and think

Your knowledge will increase?

183
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,019
Only pressure will increase

184
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,454
its a college,
not a pressure cooker

185
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,244

194
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,086
He was in a mood to do photography

195
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,860
what was your percentage at that time?

196
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,577

202
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:56,738
father did not give us food,
then we went to Raju's house

203
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,046
everything was old

204
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:09,416

00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:30,270
Kamo is 28 years old.
People ask for Maruti 800 in marriage

207
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,273

212
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,161
and concentrate on food

213
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,938

214
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,649
lets go somewhere to eat food

215
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,655

it was you who did all this

518
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:20,767

Will it come by selling laptop?

529
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:20,487

deal with clients

535
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:56,248
