00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,338
- A dead mouse!
- (FEAR SCREAMS)

160
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:13,220
ANGER: Great. This is just great.
DISGUST: I'm gonna be sick.

161
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,736
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

162
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,256
- Get off of me!
- (FEAR SCREAMING)

163
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,657
Hey. All through the drive,

164
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,620
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

165
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,738
- (FEAR SIGHS)
- Let's go check it out!

166
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,898
DISGUST: Let's go!
ANGER: It's gonna be great!

167
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:22,972
FEAR: Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:24,331
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,657
DISGUST: I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

170
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,732
ANGER: Get out the rubber ball,

171
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,142
we're in solitary confinement.

172
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,212
Riley can't live here.

173
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,292
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

174
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:31,782
FEAR: Really bad.
DISGUST: It's absolutely the worst.

175
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,331
DISGUST: It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

176
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,971
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

177
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,333
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

178
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,862
- Where did you read that?
- It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:41,971
I read it and it's great.

180
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,092
We'll put the bed there.

181
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,252
JOY: And the desk over there.

182
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:45,492
FEAR: The hockey lamp goes there.

183
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,573
ANGER: Uh, put the chair there.

184
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:48,211
JOY: The trophy collection goes there.

185
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,855
FEAR: Stars! I like that!

186
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,012
JOY: Now we're talking!

187
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,851
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

188
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,736
DAD: All right. Goodbye.

189
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:55,852
Well, guess what?

190
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,651
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

191
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,136
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,498
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

193
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,131
DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.

194
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,697
You said it would be here yesterday!

195
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,057
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

196
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,218
FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!

197
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,140
ANGER: They're stressed out?
FEAR: What are we going to do?

198
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,731
- (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)
- I've got a great idea!

199
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,421
Did you even read the contract?

200
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,058
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

201
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,132
Hey! (LAUGHS)

202
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,212
DAD: Oh, no, you're not!

203
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:20,378
She's lining up for the shot!

204
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,452
DAD: Coming behind you.

205
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,295
- DAD: Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores!

206
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,981
- Yeah!
- (ALL CHEERING)

207
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,133
- Come on, Grandma!
- Ha!

208
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:29,371
"Grandma"?

209
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,175
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

210
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,777
Whoo!

211
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,700
- Hey, put me down!

- Ah! Sorry.

215
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,858
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,733
- Hello?
- Wait. Wh...

217
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,017
DAD: You're kidding.

218
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,456
(SIGHS) All right. Stall for me.

219
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,572
I'll be right there.

220
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,541
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

221
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,772
not today!

222
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,302
- (SIGHS)
- I got to go.

223
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:54,776
It's okay. We get it.

224
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,097
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

225
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,051
See you, sweetie.

226
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,491
FEAR: Dad just left us.

227
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,175
He doesn't love us anymore.

228
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,412
That's sad.

229
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,061
I should drive, right?

230
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:06,618
Joy?

231
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,457
What are you doing?

232
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,141
Uh, just give me one second.

233
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:12,260
Um, you know what I've realized?

234
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:14,732
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

235
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:19,777
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

236
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,932
Maybe we could try that?

237
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,376
Pizza sounds delicious.

238
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,021
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

239
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,931
FEAR: What the heck is that?
JOY: Who puts broccoli on pizza?

240
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,092
That's it. I'm done.

241
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,293
Congratulations, San Francisco,

242
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,577
you've ruined pizza!

243
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,857
First the Hawaiians

244
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:36,172
and now you!

245
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:39,618
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

246
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,054
MOM: Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

247
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,421
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

248
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,459
- At that diner in Nebraska.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,932
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

250
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,251
RILEY: That was disgusting.

251
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,821
JOY: Oh, good. Family is running.

252
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,251
RILEY: Dad's got a steel stomach.

253
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,975
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

254
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:56,171
What was your favorite part?

255
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,816
Spitting out the car window!

256
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,371
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

257
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:00,452
Wearing a seat belt!

258
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:02,291
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

259
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,291
- Oh, that's the one.
- Definitely!

260
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:05,812
DAD: Say cheese!

261
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:07,421
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

262
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,811
DAD: Now hold still.
MOM: The car!

263
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,100
Stop! No, no, no! (GRUNTING)

(DAD GROANS)

265
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,132
(LAUGHS) Nice one, Joy.

266
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,781
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

267
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,455
- That was pretty funny.

269
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,256
Wait. What? What happened?

270
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:29,491
FEAR: She did something
to the memory.

271
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,898
- What did you do?
- I just touched it.

272
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,854
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

273
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,177
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

274
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,220
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

275
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,981
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

276
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,291
she's gonna feel sad.

277
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,976
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, Joy.

278
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,291
I don't really know...

279
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,856
I thought maybe if you...

(STAMMERING)

281
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:49,534
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

282
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:53,217
Just don't touch any other memories

283
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,731
until we figure out what's going on.

284
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,898
- Okay.
- JOY: All right.

285
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,219
Get ready. This is a monster railing

286
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,254
and we are riding it all the way down!

287
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,371
- Wait, what? What happened?
- (CLATTERING)

288
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,611
- (FEAR AND JOY GASP)
- A Core Memory!

289
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:12,732
Oh, no!

290
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,017
Sadness, what are you doing?

291
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,092
SADNESS: It looked like
one was crooked

292
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,100
so I opened it and then it fell out.

293
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,212
I...

294
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,412
Whoo-hoo!

295
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,895
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

- FEAR: Joy!
- Whoa, whoa!

297
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,733
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

298
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:38,172
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

299
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,412
I know. I'm sorry.

300
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,255
Something's wrong with me.

301
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,260
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

302
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,419
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

303
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:48,182
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

304
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,413
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

305
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:52,460
(STUTTERING) You know what?

306
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,460
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

307
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,255
There's always a way to
turn things around,

308
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,776
to find the fun.

309
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,655
Yeah. Find the fun.

310
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,411
I don't know how to do that.

311
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:02,902
Okay. Well,

312
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,461
try to think of something funny.

313
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,812
Um... Oh!

314
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:08,616
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

315
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,654
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

316
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,455
What about that time with Meg

317
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,454

00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,977
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

958
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,735
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

959
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,531
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

960
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,772
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

JOY: Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

962
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:45,422
The station is right
through here. After you.

00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,777
- Joy.
- What?

964
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,575
I read about this place

965
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,295
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

966
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,374
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

967
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,539
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

968

What are you talking about?

969
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:58,582
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

970
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:02,378
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

971

Look at me. I'm closer to the station

972
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,375

there's something in there.
