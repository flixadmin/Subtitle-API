1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Stay down!

2
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Don't move!

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Yeah!

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the <i>Sawyer-Two.</i>

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
Requesting immediate aid.

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,400
<i>They say everybody's
good at something.</i>

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
<i>Me? I talk to fish.</i>

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,680
<i>That's how I met my friend, Storm.</i>

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,880
<i>He's always there when I need a lift.</i>

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,720
<i>Some people think
that makes me a joke</i>

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>but I don't care. You know why?</i>

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
<i>'Cause I'm also good
at something else.</i>

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,280
<i>And that's breaking heads.</i>

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Pow! Papa took on all the pirates.

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,456
I was like,
"Well, the pirates think that..."

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Hi-ya...

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Papa kicked their butts.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>Those chumlickers
didn't stand a chance.</i>

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,176
<i>Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.</i>

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Yeah! Come on!

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,400
Watch out!

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,520
<i>Oh, yeah, this is my son, Arthur Jr.</i>

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,280
<i>See, four years ago,
everything changed.</i>

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
<i>I met a woman, fell in love,
and the next thing I know</i>

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
<i>we're getting married
and having a kid.</i>

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,841
<i>This little guy's the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
<i>But this kid, he doesn't sleep.</i>

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Okay...

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
<i>And he never misses.</i>

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
What the...

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,056
<i>And then, I'm up at the crack of dawn</i>

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,160
<i>because on top of getting married
and having a kid...</i>

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
<i>I finally got a job.</i>

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
<i>That's right.
I'm the king of fricking Atlantis.</i>

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
<i>How did I score that, you asked?</i>

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,
from attacking the surface world.</i>

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>And in doing so,
I claimed the throne from him.</i>

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
<i>At first, I was like...</i>

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah!

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,080
The territorial waters
are long-held...

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
<i>But then, as it turned out</i>

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,200
<i>being king wasn't all
it was cracked up to be.</i>

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
I would kindly remind King Nereus...

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
<i>It's just meetings all day,
and politics.</i>

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,776
<i>I'm so bored, I don't even know
which end of the Brine King</i>

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
<i>I'm supposed to be looking at
half the time.</i>

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah! That was awesome!

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,336
<i>And as if that's not bad enough</i>

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,600
<i>turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing</i>

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
<i>that nobody told me about</i>

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,160
<i>which basically gets to shoot down
everything I want to do.</i>

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,896
<i>The only thing
that makes all the hard work</i>

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,760
<i>and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.</i>

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey! You missed me!

58
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,120
<i>But of course,
there are fun parts of the job.</i>

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,920
<i>I get to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.</i>

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,680
<i>Especially when I get to take down
an illegal cage fight or two.</i>

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
<i>But for everything I get right,
something else gets screwed up.</i>

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Ah, fu...

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
(Daddy... Daddy)

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
(Gaelic)
<i>Sláinte.</i>

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
So...

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
he's gonna need a little brother
or sister to play with.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's got a dog.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey, I'm serious.

70
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,880
I saw how lonely it was for you
growing up.

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
An only child.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,760
I always regretted
I couldn't give you that.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Yeah, well, don't be
too hard on yourself.

74
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,280
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dickbag.

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Come on.

76
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,600
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Sure, siblings bicker and fight

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,080
but at the end of the day,
they're family.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
You should be able
to count on them for help.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah, well, I'll still take the dog
over him any day.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Hey, look at that.

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Holy crap.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,280
Hi, baby boy.
Are you talking to the fishies?

84
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh, man. Pops,
this is blowing my mind.

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,920
My whole life I've wanted
to share this gift with someone.

86
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,120
Yeah, but you and me, son,
we're different. We're special.

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
We're connected
to the land and the sea.

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,480
I can't wait to introduce you to all
the majestic creatures on our planet.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,880
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,320
Yeah, you and me.

91
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,040
I cross-referenced the coordinates
from Dr. Shin. Nothing.

92
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants
under the ice.

93
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,640
Looks like he's led us
on another wild goose chase.

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
Every day I don't fix my power suit
is another day Aquaman gets to live.

95
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
Check again.

96
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
We're close this time. I can feel it.

97
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,840
Expedition log, day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

98
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,400
My quest for Atlantis has brought me
to the ends of the earth.

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,040
David Kane is losing his patience.

100
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,160
If I don't turn up the Atlantean
technology he's looking for soon

101
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,600
they're probably going to...

102
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,056
You know what?
Let's not even go there.

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm sure everything will be fine.

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
Dr. Shin, take a look at this!

105
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Please tell me you found something.

106
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
Seismic array is going crazy.

107
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Where's the epicenter?

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
We're standing on it.

109
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Run!

110
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,680
What just happened? An earthquake?

111
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,040
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

112
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Come on, get up!

113
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,696
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on, let's go!

114
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,080
Come on, get up!
Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

115
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,040
Come on, we gotta move!
Come on, let's move!

116
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Help, please!

117
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,680
Help... Please! Don't let go!

118
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
What the hell happened to you?

119
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
There's something back there.

120
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Astounding.

121
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
My readings show something's
down here.

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

123
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,376
If it is, we might be able
to scavenge

124
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
the tech you need to fix your suit.

125
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,720
How is this place even possible?

126
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,640
This was all probably solid ice
until we started heating the planet.

127
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Well, thank God
for global warming, am I right?

128
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,880
Yeah, that's not exactly
a good thing.

129
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
The tracks lead down there.

130
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Suit up.

131
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,840
Wait. The tracks lead down there,
which means...

132
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,720
the monster's down there.

133
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
Okay. I guess we're going down there.

134
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
I don't believe this.

135
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,120
It's a structure of some kind.

136
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,280
And there's more buried in the ice.

137
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Here I thought we were just going
to find a ship.

138
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,720
- Everyone, fan out and search.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,520
We've stumbled upon
something big here, Doc.

140
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,520
This has to be
a few thousand years old.

141
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,520
Astounding.

142
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,160
What is this place?

143
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,760
At last, you are here.

144
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,560
Free me from my prison

145
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,520
and I will grant you the strength

146
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,920
<i>to kill the man
who murdered your father.</i>

147
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,880
You can't leave him like this!

148
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,360
You ask the sea for mercy.

149
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,640
Get out of here! You need to live
so you can kill that son of a bitch.

150
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,480
<i>You will take from him
what he stole from you.</i>

151
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
<i>His home will burn</i>

152
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,640
<i>and his kingdom will fall
before my legions.</i>

153
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,800
David. No, David.

154
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
David!

155
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,920
David. David, it's okay.

156
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
You're all right.

157
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
What the hell is that thing?

158
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
<i>Just unbelievable footage</i>

159
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,240
<i>coming in from all around the world.</i>

160
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
<i>Good evening, folks.</i>

161
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,880
<i>In the past five months, we've seen</i>

162
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
<i>an extraordinary rise in temperatures</i>

163
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,200
<i>reported around the world.</i>

164
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,360
<i>And that has resulted in some of
the wildest weather we've ever seen.</i>

165
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,760
<i>Yes, this is thundersnow
in Dallas, Texas.</i>

166
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,600
<i>Visibility is near zero, and there's
more snow expected tonight</i>

167
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,480
<i>than Dallas usually sees
in an entire year.</i>

168
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,560
<i>It's only one part
of a worldwide weather phenomenon</i>

169
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,960
<i>unlike anything
we've ever seen before...</i>

170
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Arthur.

171
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

172
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,240
There's been another plague outbreak.

173
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,800
<i>in which scientists
are at a loss to explain.</i>

174
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,560
<i>But the real question is</i>

175
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,120
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

176
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,400
<i>And how much hotter
is it going to get?</i>

177
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,720
Where did it hit this time?

178
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,800
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis

179
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
and there are now reports
of outbreaks

180
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

181
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,440
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

182
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Why now?

183
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

184
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,040
Take your pick.

185
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,800
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

186
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,896
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

187
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,240
if they don't even know we exist.

188
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,176
If you want to be a part
of the conversation

189
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
we have to take our seat
at the table.

190
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,720
It's time for Atlantis
to reveal itself to the surface.

191
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,080
Your Majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

192
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,040
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

193
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,160
and combine our technologies
to reverse the damage

194
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,280
that they've already done.

195
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
And I know this is
against our traditions

196
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
but the world is shrinking

197
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,280
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

198
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,760
Times have changed.

199
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
Atlantis wants this.

200
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,360
There's a whole generation out there
that don't want to hide anymore.

201
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,480
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

202
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,800
killed your own beloved mentor

203
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,400
and you want to negotiate with them?

204
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,480
We gave your brother war powers

205
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,880
and made him
Ocean Master for a reason.

206
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,480
If we ever decide to make ourselves
known to the surface dwellers

207
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,480
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

208
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey, not bad.

209
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,120
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

210
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't know how you did it, Pops.

211
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,840
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us

212
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,200
but that little baby boy is still
kicking our asses.

213
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
And you...

214
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,440
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

215
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,560
You're the real superhero.

216
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
To single parents.

217
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,560
Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

218
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,280
Yeah, well,
I just plain suck at my job.

219
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,720
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

220
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,880
The problem is, half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

221
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,440
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

222
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

223
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I know.

224
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I miss him.

225
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Hey.

226
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
You can't save them all, son.

227
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,640
You really want to know
how I raised you here? By myself?

228
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,240
I just keep going.

229
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,440
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

230
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

231
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Sometimes not giving up
is the most heroic thing you can do.

232
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,640
(Māori) <i>Kia kaua e tuohu.</i>
(Bow to no one.)

233
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,400
<i>Koira te tikanga o te toa.</i>
(That's the way of a warrior.)

234
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,600
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

235
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeah, don't worry about that.

236
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,080
You just remember
who built this ship.

237
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm more worried about
how long ago they built it.

238
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,640
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

239
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Hey, Doc.

240
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,160
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

241
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,480
Expedition log, day 613.

242
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,320
Kane is off on
our most dangerous mission yet.

243
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,880
<i>A three-man octobot
infiltration team.</i>

244
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,240
<i>It's incredible that these
ancient machines we found</i>

245
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,200
<i>still function after all these years.</i>

246
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,800
<i>All I did was retrofit them
to our needs.</i>

247
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,240
<i>But they require
a very specialized fuel</i>

248
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
<i>to keep them running.</i>

249
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

250
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
<i>I don't know how he knows about this</i>

251
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>but it all started the day
he found that trident.</i>

252
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,160
<i>Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know</i>

253
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,920
<i>including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum</i>

254
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,640
<i>is to steal it
from highly protected storage vaults.</i>

255
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
<i>And we're about the hit
the most dangerous one of them all.</i>

256
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,320
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

257
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
<i>No margin for error.</i>

258
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>Okay, this should take you through.</i>

259
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,920
<i>We don't want any confrontation.</i>

260
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,440
<i>David, we can't fight
their entire army.</i>

261
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,560
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

262
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,440
<i>We have no idea
what kind of security measures</i>

263
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
<i>they have down there.</i>

264
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,920
Commencing extraction.

265
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,240
<i>Be careful. It's highly volatile.</i>

266
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,080
Loading barge now.

267
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,280
Stingray. Change of plans.

268
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,200
I need an extraction now!

269
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,240
All hands to battle stations!

270
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,160
(Portuguese)
<i>Postos de combate!</i>

271
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,760
<i>Tudo a seus postos de combate!</i>

272
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Astounding.

273
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,480
<i>Attention, unidentified vessel.</i>

274
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,720
<i>- You are out of the transit zone.</i>
- Doctor.

275
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,680
Power up the sonic battery.

276
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,480
<i>Illegal border crossing will be met</i>

277
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,080
<i>- with deadly force.</i>
- Now!

278
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
Commencing charge.

279
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480
<i>Border Control, intruder approaching.</i>

280
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,920
<i>Arm hydrocannon and lock target.</i>

281
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,560
Hydrocannon at front border gate
locking in on target.

282
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
Chargers set to maximum power.

283
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>Intruder in sight.</i>

284
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
<i>Take them out!</i>

285
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,880
What are you waiting for? Fire!

286
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,840
<i>Sir, Atlantean hostiles
are approaching.</i>

287
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,720
<i>Split up. Make your way
to the extraction point.</i>

288
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
<i>Roger.</i>

289
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,880
They've raided the storage vault.
We can't let them get away.

290
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
Don't worry, they won't.
I'm on this one.

291
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,840
Hold your fire! They're cutting
through the Night Market.

292
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,800
Watch out for the civilians!

293
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,040
<i>Warning. Warning.
Illegal entrance into hypertube.</i>

294
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,680
<i>Exceeding maximum speed of 600kts.</i>

295
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,720
<i>Reduce speed immediately.</i>

296
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Oh, shit.

297
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,200
<i>David, we're here
at the extraction point.</i>

298
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,120
<i>The orichalcum
is on board and secure.</i>

299
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

300
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,480
Not yet!
I'm gonna kill me a dead mermaid.

301
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,440
Get away from my wife!

302
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,720
Your wife?

303
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,120
First, you steal
your brother's throne

304
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,160
then you steal his woman?

305
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,360
Aquaman, shame on you.

306
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,640
David, we gotta go.

307
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,640
The entire Atlantean army
is headed this way.

308
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,360
If we don't leave now, we're dead.

309
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,840
Twenty degrees port!

310
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,920
Fire the sonic cannon!

311
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,640
Come on, Shin!

312
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,320
<i>Lady Karshon has called

<i>of the High Council</i>

314
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,960

00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,960
<i>The throne is the heart of Atlantis.</i>

316
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
<i>Too often now it stands empty</i>

317
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,760
<i>while our king
spends half his time on land.</i>

318
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,600
<i>And now his surface-world enemies
have followed him home.</i>

319
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
<i>This tragedy is merely a taste
of the havoc that will be brought</i>

320
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,560
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes known
to the surface.</i>

321
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,480
<i>Because if he cannot protect
his own family</i>

322
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,960
<i>how is he supposed to protect us?</i>

323
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,840
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

324
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,120
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

325
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,600
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

326
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,040
The technology seems ancient

327
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,040
but we've never seen
anything like it.

328
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,080
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

329
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,520
that disrupts the nervous system.

330
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,840
Do we know what was stolen?

331
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,080
He escaped with a large stockpile
of orichalcum.

332
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,240
Am I supposed to know what that is?

333
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,840
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

334
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,280
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

335
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,320
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

336
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,040
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

337
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,600
before we realized
what we were doing.

338
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,560
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

339
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,160
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

340
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,416
Well, we should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

341
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,480
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

342
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,080
We think he's been
launching secret raids

343
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,560
for at least five months.

344
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,080
This is just the time he got caught.

345
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

346
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,320
that's causing disasters
on the surface

347
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,160
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

348
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,040
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

349
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,480
Why would he do that?

350
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,680
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

351
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,120
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet

352
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
we don't have much time.

353
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,080
He is pushing this past
the tipping point.

354
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,560
He must be stopped or a global
climate meltdown is imminent.

355
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,400
We need to find him, but he has
completely vanished off the radar.

356
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,560
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

357
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,200
But you're not gonna like it.

358
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Your brother?

359
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help

360
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,720
but he's dealt with Manta in the past

361
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,016
and he's the only one who might know
how to find him in time.

362
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,800
The Fishermen will never allow you
to speak to Orm.

363
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,640
He killed their king.

364
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

365
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,280
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm
from an allied nation.

366
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,400
It would be an act of war.

367
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,080
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

368
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm gonna break him out myself.

369
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,880
Arthur, Karshon is looking
for a reason to seize war powers.

370
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
You will be nothing more
than a figurehead if she does that.

371
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,296
My place is out there where I belong,
where I'm actually good at what I do.

372
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

373
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,280
I've got to do this.

374
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,480
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

375
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

376
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,800
Then help me not get caught.

377
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,080
Xebelian intelligence
has recently learned

378
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
that your brother is being held

379
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,400
on the surface in a secret
one-of-a-kind underground facility.

380
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,360
{\an5}They're assuming no sea dweller

381
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,400
{\an5}would ever dare cross the desert.

382
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,360
{\an5}And here's a special outfit for you.

383
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,760
What is that? A boy's extra medium?

384
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,040
It's supposed to be tight.

385
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,000
The chromatophores change color
and camouflage you for up to a minute

386
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,160
<i>making you undetectable
to most sensors.</i>

387
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,040
<i>They'll never see you coming.</i>

388
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,096
What are we doing for comms?

389
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,840
Open comms are too risky.

390
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I'll be sending a cephalopod
with you to act as a messenger.

391
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
That's an octopus.

392
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,120
Tactical Operations
and Pursuit Operative.

393
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
Topo, for short.

394
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,920
Genetically-engineered intelligence
for infiltration and espionage.

395
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

396
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Just try and lay low
when we get in there, okay?

397
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,240
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

398
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,000
is starting to smell like
warm chum butter.

399
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,680
Topo, you dumb squid!

400
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,880
God, come on!

401
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is ink piss?

402
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,400
<i>The prison is guarded
by fearsome Deserter remnants.</i>

403
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,040
<i>Death-worshipping ascetics who
survived when the Sahara went dry</i>

404
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,360
<i>by turning to blood for sustenance.</i>

405
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,360
<i>If they catch you,
they'll bleed you dry.</i>

406
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,960
<i>When you find Orm, he'll be weak.</i>

407
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>They're limiting his water supply</i>

408
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,320
<i>just enough to keep him alive.</i>

409
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,280
And if you do see Orm,
you tell him that I love him.

410
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,440
You tell him
that I think of him every day.

411
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
I will.

412
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,880
Look, I know he's family

413
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,160
but you can't forget
who you're dealing with here.

414
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,960
Once you've broken Orm out

415
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,056
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

416
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,320
<i>You need him,
but you can never trust him.</i>

417
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,720
You look rough.

418
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,240
What the hell are you doing here?

419
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm here to break you out.

420
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,520
Have you lost your mind?

421
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,920
You're the one who put me here.

422
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,496
Why you bringing up old shit?

423
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,920
Come on, we'll talk about it later.

424
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
You cannot break me out.

425
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,720
There's a treaty
with the Fishermen Kingdom.

426
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,000
Look, I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

427
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,480
And you're the only one that
can help me. So you do the math.

428
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,320
Oh, shit.

429
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,880
Come on, <i>Cast Away</i>.
Grab Wilson, let's roll.

430
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,720
Come on. Let's go.

431
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
This changes nothing.

432
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,520
Wouldn't have it any other way,
little brother.

433
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,080
Do not call me brother.

434
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,816
(Spanish) <i>¿Hermanito?</i>
(Little brother?)

435
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,880
Come on.

436
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

437
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,280
Wake up and open the door.

438
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Topo?

439
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,680
The cephalopod?

440
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

441
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Topo!

442
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,240
All right, come on.

443
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Wait.

444
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,960
Did you... bring water?

445
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Yeah.

446
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
No, sorry.

447
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,280
I drank it all on the way here.

448
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,440
- What?
- Bro, it's hot up there.

449
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Easy.

450
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,200
- You know how to ride one of these?
- Are you kidding?

451
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,800
I don't even know
what the hell it is!

452
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,360
What?

453
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Yeah!

454
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Yeah!

455
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
No!

456
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,760
No!

457
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,840
No!

458
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
No!

459
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,360
All right, the water's right there.

460
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Let's go, skinny jeans.

461
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,280
Yeah. All right.

462
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,360
Good job, little brother. High-five.

463
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
No.

464
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,480
All right. Good job.

465
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,360
You know, I got a bunch
of king shit to do

466
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,760
back in Atlantis, so we should go.

467
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,560
Come on, Topo!

468
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,760
This is worse
than I could have possibly imagined.

469
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,080
The safety and security
of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

470
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,040
No king has allowed
the Great City Wall to be breached

471
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,480
in a hundred generations.

472
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,680
A hundred generations? Really?

473
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
How many years is that?

474
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm bad with geology.
What is that, like, a million years?

475
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,200
You're calling me one in a million?

476
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,520
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

477
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,160
It's undignified for a king to jest.

478
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,440
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness,
if I use comedy

479
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,760
to mask my feelings
and deal with stress.

480
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,136
Otherwise,
I'd end up looking like you.

481
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,960
A very tight butthole.

482
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Super tight.

483
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,480
You know, if the pressures
of leadership are too stressful

484
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,120
perhaps you should leave
and let someone

485
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,840
who knows what they're doing be king.

486
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
You know what?

487
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,960
I cannot wait to throw your ass
back in prison when this is all over.

488
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,400
You won't have to.
Once I stop David Kane

489
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,856
I'll surrender myself
to the Fishermen.

490
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,960
That is my honor to Atlantis.

491
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,000
You're so dramatic.

492
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,000
Whatever.
Just help me find this asshole.

493
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,760
Well, my contact
will at least know where to look.

494
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,400
What happened to him?

495
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,680
David Kane that I knew was ruthless,
but he wasn't insane.

496
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,040
<i>This guy just put a gun to the
world's head and pulled the trigger.</i>

497
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,680
<i>Without even making any demands.</i>

498
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,720
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

499
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,081
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

500
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,280
Well, you found it. All I did
was figure out how it worked.

501
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,280
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

502
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
Yeah, well, what can I say?

503
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
Things don't always go as planned.

504
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,400
But that's what I'm afraid of.

505
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,800
David, this stuff could reshape
the entire planet.

506
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Hey, Doc.

507
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,120
We are this close to unlocking
the greatest power in human history.

508
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,920
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

509
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,480
If I said yes, would you let me?

510
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,040
Sure.

511
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,120
You want to see
how long you last in that jungle?

512
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Be my guest.

513
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,320
Yeah, I'll stick around.

514
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Yeah.

515
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,440
<i>Welcome to the last frontier.</i>

516
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,800
They scavenged ships from around
the world to build this place.

517
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,360
The Sunken Citadel.

518
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,200
It is the one place in the world

519
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,440
where the scum
of the land and sea mingle.

520
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,680
It is where people come to disappear.

521
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,360
It's an impressive shithole.

522
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,560
How have I never
heard of this place before?

523
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,720
It is not meant to be
common knowledge.

524
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
It's a pirate haven.

525
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Pirates?

526
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,896
Listen, I don't know
if you know this about me

527
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,400
but I'm not too popular with pirates.

528
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,120
Oh, I'm well aware.

529
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,120
Relax. It was the only way
to get us both in.

530
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,296
You could've at least
given me a heads-up.

531
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,680
Would you have gone along with it?

532
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,720
- Hell, no.
- Then put a hook in it.

533
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,680
There. That's Kingfish.

534
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,880
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

535
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,200
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

536
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Cool.

537
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,320
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

538
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,760
Just let me handle this.

539
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,640
He's our best shot at finding Manta

540
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,856
and he's not going to
tell us anything if you go in there

541
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,320
flexing your muscles at him.

542
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,000
You're so lucky we didn't
grow up together, little brother.

543
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,520
Do not call me "brother."

544
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,360
Well...

545
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,680
this is a bit of a surprise,
isn't it?

546
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,880
I didn't realize
you'd been released from prison.

547
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,880
It is a recent development.

548
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,320
Outlaws, aren't we all?

549
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,160
We need to find David Kane.

550
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,480
Bad news, I'm afraid.

551
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,800
David Kane is no longer
on the market.

552
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,720
Not for sale at any price.

553
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,360
He's solely running
as an independent operator.

554
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,040
Where is he holed up now?

555
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,960
In exchange, I offer a favor...

556
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,360
from the King of Atlantis.

557
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,600
You seriously expect me
to play footsie with someone

558
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,056
with that kind of blood
on their hands?

559
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,520
I don't have hands!

560
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,120
Or feet!

561
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,280
Listen, if the information
checks out good

562
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,840
I promise you that
I won't immediately come back here

563
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,040
and tear this place apart.

564
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,680
That's too bad.

565
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,600
Traditionally, the kings of Atlantis
have turned a blind eye

566
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,240
to the Sunken Citadel.

567
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,440
Now, we have to blind it for you.

568
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Fine. Flex your muscles.

569
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,200
Smash his stupid head in!

570
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,320
Boom!

571
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,760
Gotcha, fatback!

572
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,680
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

573
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Talk.

574
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,080
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

575
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,840
A dormant volcano
in the South Pacific

576
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,200
called Devil's Deep.

577
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,960
Talk faster.

578
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,400
It's been barren for years.

579
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,560
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

580
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,480
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start to get close.

581
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,240
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

582
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,960
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am

583
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,400
I'd say that's
where Kane is hiding out.

584
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,360
We got all we needed. Let's go!

585
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,080
<i>Rise up, come
Rise up through the fire</i>

586
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,440
Soon you'll be
more powerful than he is.

587
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,080
But you're not ready yet,
and you involved him far too soon.

588
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,040
I sense them closing in on us.

589
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Do I seem concerned?

590
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,320
If anything, it's even easier now.

591
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,080
We couldn't have planned it
any better than...

592
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Hey.

593
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,040
I just wanted to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

594
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,360
is now running at peak output.

595
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
I win.

596
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,200
Topo, go back to Atlantis
and give them our coordinates.

597
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,440
(Japanese) <i>Hayaku shite kudasai.</i>
(Hurry up, make it quick.)

598
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,080
You know
what'd be amazing right now?

599
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Reinforcements?

600
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,680
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

601
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,280
You gotta admit,
the food is so much better up here.

602
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,800
I find that hard to believe.

603
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,040
Hold up.

604
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,416
Are you telling me you never went
topside to have a cheeseburger?

605
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
- What?
- Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

606
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,320
Or a thick, juicy, medium-raw steak

607
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,000
with fries and a shake
and you dip it...

608
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,360
Even the words that surface dwellers
give their food sound disgusting.

609
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,080
You've let your prejudices stop you
from enjoying half the world.

610
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,680
You should think about that.
It's your loss, dude.

611
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Oh, yeah.

612
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,600
Bet you never had one of these.

613
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,160
- What is it?
- It's a cockroach.

614
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
You eat it?

615
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,800
Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

616
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,800
That's good. Here, drink this.

617
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,720
Okay, you first.

618
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,160
Are you seeing this?

619
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,360
That's not normal?

620
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,240
Definitely not normal.

621
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Let's get out of here.

622
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,960
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

623
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,080
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time

624
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,760
turning them mons... trous.

625
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
Oh, shi...

626
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,520
Run!

627
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
Come on!

628
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
Faster!

629
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,440
What the hell are you doing?

630
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,400
I don't know.
I'm not used to running!

631
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Just do what I do.

632
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,240
Use your arms,
use your legs. Come on!

633
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,680
Like this?

634
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,960
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

635
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,520
- Wait up!
- Yeah!

636
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,280
We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

637
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,840
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

638
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,480
So, what do you wanna do? Stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

639
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,960
What is that? What does that say?

640
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,960
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

641
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,720
"A true king builds bridges."

642
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
What are you doing?

643
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,120
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

644
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,520
See? A true king builds bridges.

645
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,560
That's a metaphor!

646
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,200
Hey! I forgot to tell you!

647
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,520
Mom says she loves you!

648
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,960
She thinks about you all the time!

649
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,400
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

650
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,080
I don't know. I'm just tired
of waiting for the right moment.

651
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,760
Come on!

652
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,640
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

653
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,360
David? I just ran more tests,
and this data is really disturbing.

654
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,320
We have to stop
burning the orichal... cum.

655
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,560
David?

656
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,720
Okay, Doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

657
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Here it is.

658
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,720
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything he holds dear.

659
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,680
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

660
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,280
I will avenge my father.

661
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,080
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

662
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,480
David, you can't trust the trident.

663
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,960
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

664
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,880
Pray I never show it to you again.

665
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,800
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

666
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,240
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

667
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,240
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

668
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,920
Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm not asking
for your advice on this.

669
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,856
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

670
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,760
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

671
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
So, what's your plan?

672
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,640
I don't have one yet.

673
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,336
But he came after my wife,
which means

674
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm gonna pull his tongue
out of his butt.

675
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,960
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

676
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,696
This coming from the guy who turned
the entire nation of Atlantis

677
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,920
into his own private ego trip?

678
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,280
My ego?

679
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,936
You're the one
who swam to the front gate

680
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,216
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

681
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,440
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

682
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,720
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

683
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,880
Unbelievable.

684
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Wait... wait.

685
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,840
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

686
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,200
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

687
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,640
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

688
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,160
And I might even be screwing that up.

689
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,616
You really had no ambition for it?

690
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,720
Absolutely not.

691
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,320
From the day
my father found out you existed

692
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,056
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

693
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,136
and challenge me for the throne.

694
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Wow, that's really sad.

695
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,296
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

696
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,880
with basically no prep time
whatsoever.

697
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
Roasted.

698
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,160
That is not how it happened.

699
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,056
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

700
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,296
No, she didn't. I kicked your ass.

701
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,440
Nope. She made the little
water tornado, I fell in it.

702
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,000
Okay, shut up. I think we're here.

703
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,920
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

704
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,240
Come on, let's do this.

705
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,960
Once this is over with, we should
go get some burgers and beers.

706
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,720
- Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

707
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,160
I don't even know those words.

708
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,400
Hey.

709
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
Brother.

710
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
(Māori)
<i>Sassa!</i>

711
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,040
It's an orichalcum furnace.

712
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,880
All that stolen orichalcum.

713
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,320
They're just burning it up.

714
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,480
He's heating the atmosphere
on purpose.

715
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,960
This is catastrophic.

716
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,320
This whole place
must be heat-shielded

717
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,600
to protect it from the surface's
thermal satellites.

718
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,280
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

719
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,320
To take out this reactor, we would
have to crater the entire island.

720
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,200
Get away from there! Now!

721
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,240
This blaster may be ancient, but it
was built for killing Atlanteans.

722
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,680
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

723
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,440
I just didn't want you to break me
in half before I could surrender.

724
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,880
Please take me with you.

725
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,360
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

726
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,840
No, no. Wait, please.

727
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,320
I didn't want any of this.

728
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,440
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

729
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,696
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

730
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm a scientist and I just wanted
to be taken seriously.

731
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,600
David Kane said he could help me,
but now he won't let me leave.

732
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,480
You expect us to believe
you have nothing to do with this?

733
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,600
I know.

734
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,560
I've done things I'm not proud of.

735
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,880
But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

736
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
Knock him out.

737
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
No.

738
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,680
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

739
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,360
- What?
- No.

740
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Fine.

741
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,240
You can come with us.

742
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,160
Thank you.

743
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,920
But you better start talking,
or I'm gonna give you one <i>sassa.</i>

744
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Okay, okay.

745
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,600
It's the Black Trident.

746
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,760
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

747
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,520
It gives Kane great powers
and in return...

748
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,960
I hate when that happens.

749
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Stop them!

750
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,736
(Portuguese) <i>Tu, e tu...</i>
(You, and you...)

751
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,040
<i>levem-no daqui.</i>
(take him away.)

752
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
No!

753
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,320
No... no! Not the orichalcum!

754
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,560
You wanna blow us up?

755
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,400
- This stuff blows up?
- Yes!

756
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,480
My bad!

757
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,600
Then stop using it!

758
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,840
Just shut up
and let me save your ass.

759
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
Again.

760
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,320
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

761
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,400
I told you, he's stronger now.

762
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,160
He's still just a surface dweller.

763
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,920
Bro.

764
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,560
I never expected to see you two
fighting side by side.

765
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,800
We're making a special exception
just for you.

766
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,360
No one hits my brother but me.

767
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,800
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

768
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,320
You're making this easy.

769
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,600
Yeah!

770
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,840
Come at me.

771
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,920
The killer of kings.

772
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,400
Take that island down!

773
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,160
Fire at will!

774
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,720
We've got to get out of here.

775
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,840
<i>Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

776
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,000
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

777
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,440
Shin, let's go!

778
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,880
What are you waiting for?

779
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,720
Fire the goddamn cannon!

780
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,640
I'm sorry to drag you all into this.

781
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,960
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

782
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,120
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel. I do.

783
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,240
And the Brine Kingdom
has not forgotten its debt to you.

784
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,120
You may count on us always.

785
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,920
Something happened to me

786
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,480
when I touched that Black Trident.

787
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,720
Why is he even here?

788
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,360
He should be
on his way back to prison.

789
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,960
We should hear what he has to say.

790
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,560
I made that mistake once.

791
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,640
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

792
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,440
And he cut off my claw.

793
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,200
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

794
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,400
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

795
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,080
And just for the record

796
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,760
the only reason we made it this far
is because of him.

797
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,200
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

798
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,160
Mom, I don't know enough about this.

799
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,760
Is that even possible?

800
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,560
All anyone knows for sure
is there once was a seventh kingdom

801
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,440
and then one day,
just before the fall

802
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,720
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

803
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,720
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

804
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,080
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

805
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
It's called Necrus.

806
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,640
And I didn't just see it.

807
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,200
I knew it.

808
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,880
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

809
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,480
Flashes of someone else's memories.

810
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,800
During King Atlan's time, there were
seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

811
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,800
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

812
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,360
<i>By exploiting orichalcum</i>

813
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,200
<i>Necrus rapidly became
a superpower unlike any other.</i>

814
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,240
But it came at a terrible price.

815
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,600
<i>Poisoning the land, the sea.</i>

816
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,920
<i>Even the mind of the tyrant
who ruled Necrus.</i>

817
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,760
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

818
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,880
<i>Atlan pleaded with him
to stop using it</i>

819
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,320
<i>before the world
was irrevocably damaged.</i>

820
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,720
<i>However, Kordax resented Atlan</i>

821
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,440
<i>thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.</i>

822
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,280
<i>So he resorted to dark magic
and crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

823
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,160
<i>That Black Trident.</i>

824
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,680
<i>He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...</i>

825
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,760
to fight Atlantis.

826
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,240
So the two brothers went to war.

827
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,840
<i>But Atlan defeated Kordax
and imprisoned him and all of Necrus</i>

828
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,880
<i>with a spell cast
with his own blood...</i>

829
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,600
<i>to ensure that Kordax's dark power
would never be found.</i>

830
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,320
<i>And that is why Necrus
is stricken from the chronicles.</i>

831
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,400
This evil was supposed
to remain frozen for eternity.

832
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,200
But David Kane has found it.

833
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,280
<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

834
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,960
But even with the ice cap melting,
Kordax still can't be freed.

835
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,080
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

836
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,800
Only Atlan himself could release him.

837
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,160
Manta doesn't need Atlan himself.
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

838
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,800
Blood magic isn't really magic,
it's DNA.

839
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,920
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

840
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,960
That means he needs blood
from either you, me, or Arthur.

841
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,760
We're the end of the bloodline.

842
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,640
No, we're not.

843
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,320
<i>Wildfires would have
made headlines across the world.</i>

844
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,600
<i>But now, they're almost
a weekly occurrence.</i>

845
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,920
<i>We're witnessing unprecedented
weather events across the globe</i>

846
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,440
<i>and meteorologists are at a loss</i>

847
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,240
<i>to explain this rapid change
in climate.</i>

848
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,000
<i>From sweltering heat waves
and droughts</i>

849
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,920
<i>which are shattering
temperature records</i>

850
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,480
<i>to torrential rains and flooding.</i>

851
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,376
- What is going on?
<i>- Hurricanes have been bearing down</i>

852
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,240
<i>on the East Coast, leaving
one million homes without power...</i>

853
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,800
Make that a million and one.

854
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,040
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

855
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,240
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

856
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,480
Dad!

857
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,240
- Tom!
- Dad!

858
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,440
Tom!

859
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,240
No! Dad!

860
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,480
Where's Junior?

861
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,920
No!

862
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,400
I'm sorry, son.

863
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,240
Where's Junior?

864
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,320
Manta... took Junior.

865
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,960
- No!
- No!

866
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,240
No!

867
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,640
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

868
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,840
He will be okay.

869
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,720
We just picked up a signal.

870
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,320
It's faint, but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

871
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,760
Headed to Antarctica.

872
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,200
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

873
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,560
I've dreamed of this.

874
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,800
The two of you standing together
as brothers.

875
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,480
Promise me
you will protect each other.

876
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,520
Promise me, Orm.

877
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,280
Go.

878
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,480
Great waves, Nereus.

879
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,640
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

880
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,800
I say we ditch all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

881
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,256
And what are you gonna do
when he turns on that sonic cannon?

882
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,520
Our only chance is to hit him
with total overwhelming force

883
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,600
from every direction.

884
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,320
- Not with Junior in the crossfire.
- What choice do we have?

885
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,400
We have no defense
against that cannon.

886
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,720
Well, wait a minute.

887
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,720
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

888
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,520
that messes
with our nervous system, right?

889
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,720
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

890
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,040
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

891
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,920
with another soundwave
on the same frequency

892
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,920
but just much, much louder?

893
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,800
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

894
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,960
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

895
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,040
Take your weapons.

896
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,520
And ready your steeds.

897
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
Really doesn't like you, does he?

898
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,120
Made a lot of progress, Doc.

899
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,376
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job

900
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,080
but we were damn close.

901
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,560
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

902
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,920
My God, what did we do?

903
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,800
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

904
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,640
All we did was fast-forward things
a few years.

905
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,400
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,
but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

906
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
Here.

907
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,480
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

908
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,960
Power up the sonic cannon.

909
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,960
Bag the child and suit up.

910
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,000
<i>Captain, we have multiple
incoming hostiles.</i>

911
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,440
You're too late.

912
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,080
No.

913
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,240
Commence charge.

914
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,920
You've gotta be kidding me.

915
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,840
Astounding.

916
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,480
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

917
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,720
The throne of Necrus
is in the heart of the city.

918
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,320
- I sense something in the water.
- Everyone, light it up.

919
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,760
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

920
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,400
Yes. I did.

921
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:25,720
Just keep your eyes open.

922
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,320
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

923
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,880
Everyone, stand ready.
Something's coming.

924
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,840
Fire at will!

925
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,200
We need to find a way out of here!

926
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,056
I think this goes
all the way through.

927
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,680
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

928
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,080
Go now and save the prince.

929
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

930
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,520
Come on, you spineless worms!

931
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,200
Bring it on!

932
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,440
Help me!

933
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,680
Give me the child.

934
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:14,160
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, Doc.

935
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,920
Get behind the portcullis!

936
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,400
We need to close the gate!

937
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,080
Get away from my son!

938
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,160
Your blood will do just fine.

939
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,400
You want blood? Come get it!

940
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,320
Aquaman!

941
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,760
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident

942
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,400
but you're only half the man he was.

943
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,960
How pathetic.

944
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,080
Mera!

945
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,240
Go!

946
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,120
Mera...

947
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,200
Run!

948
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,800
Free me from my prison

949
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:19,040
and all my power will be yours
to wield as you desire.

950
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,880
<i>Kill him, and you will be
Ocean Master again!</i>

951
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,840
Well, now this is certainly
an improvement.

952
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,680
Powerful, Atlantean body.

953
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,640
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

954
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,560
It's not true.
Come on, little brother.

955
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,640
I know you're in there.

956
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,880
Don't you see? You can't win.

957
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,320
Either you kill your brother,
or you die.

958
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:41,240
By Atlan's blood,
this magic is broken.

959
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,880
My eternal night is ended.

960
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,640
I'm done fighting
your puppets, Kordax.

961
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,120
I'm coming for you.

962
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,680
- Give it to me!
- No!

963
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,080
- I can end this.
- Don't let him take it!

964
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,640
Hasn't he taken enough already?

965
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,360
Yield the throne.

966
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,720
It's time for me
to reclaim my destiny.

967
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,560
It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

968
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,880
I knew you would do this.

969
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,440
You are the one true king.

970
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,640
Atlantis deserves its one true king.

971
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,480
I am the one true king!

972
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,000
You know, there was a time

973
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,000
when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

974
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,880
Let you know that you weren't alone,
that we were in it together.

975
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,120
<i>Promise me you'll protect each other.</i>

976
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,480
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

977
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,040
I meant what I said
when I first met you.

978
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,920
No matter what, you are not alone.

979
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,840
We're in this together.

980
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,600
You are my brother...

981
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,120
Orm.

982
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,040
Let go.

983
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,320
Orm, let it go.

984
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,720
I live again!

985
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:10,720
I have waited countless centuries
in the dark for this moment.

986
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,800
Shit.

987
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:26,240
Arthur!

988
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,840
(Māori) <i>O Kou hopena kēia.</i>
(You did this.)

989
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,240
Never.

990
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,040
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

991
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,720
Let's get outta here!

992
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,640
Hurry!

993
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,160
That's right!

994
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,720
Come on, baby! Yeah!

995
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:53,960
Yeah!

996
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,440
My love.

997
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,160
Hi, baby boy.

998
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,360
Shin.

999
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,080
Thank you.

1000
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:37,600
Astounding.

1001
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,360
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

1002
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,040
Well, I'm not.

1003
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,960
My claw got cut off.

1004
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,360
Again!

1005
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,560
You're one tough crustacean,
Your Highness.

1006
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,440
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

1007
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,000
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way, though.

1008
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,840
It's too bad you went
and had yourself killed back there.

1009
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:09,920
Yes.

1010
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,160
All this ice.

1011
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,360
It'd be impossible to find the body.

1012
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,760
Just lay low for a while.

1013
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,320
But don't go too far.

1014
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,800
I may need to call you up
for some advice.

1015
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,600
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

1016
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,560
Thank you...

1017
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,360
brother.

1018
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,080
You're not as bad at this
as you think.

1019
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,440
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1020
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,480
You were everything I was not.

1021
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,520
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

1022
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,880
And you're willing to ask for help,
even from your worst enemy.

1023
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,840
I know it may not feel like you know
what you're doing sometimes, but

1024
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,520
keep trusting your instincts.

1025
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:17,280
If you lead, Atlantis will follow.

1026
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,160
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

1027
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,280
I thought that was just a metaphor.

1028
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:33,160
Well, your metaphor might have
just saved the world's ass.

1029
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,160
<i>We've got breaking news.</i>

1030
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,480
<i>We are witnessing history.</i>

1031
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,560
{\an5}<i>A moment</i>

1032
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,840
{\an5}<i>the ramifications of which...</i>

1033
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:02,976
{\an5}<i>...simply cannot be overstated.</i>

1034
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,056
{\an5}(Spanish) <i>Un primer contacto con...</i>

1035
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,640
{\an5}(Korean)

1036
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,720
{\an5}<i>A first contact...</i>

1037
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,336
{\an5}<i>...with the undersea nation</i>
<i>of Atlantis.</i>

1038
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,400
<i>An entire civilization</i>

1039
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,920
<i>hidden for thousands of years</i>

1040
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,200
<i>about to be revealed.</i>

1041
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,120
<i>I think it's safe to say
the world will never be the same.</i>

1042
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,560
<i>The King of Atlantis has reached
out to the United Nations</i>

1043
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,480
<i>and will be officially
seeking membership.</i>

1044
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,360
<i>And is expected
to propose a joint effort</i>

1045
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,496
<i>to reverse the climate issues...</i>

1046
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,960
<i>We are told that this was the result</i>

1047
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,960
<i>of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.</i>

1048
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,480
<i>We now go live to Ellis Island</i>

1049
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,560
<i>where the first official ambassador
from Atlantis</i>

1050
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,360
<i>is about to address
the United Nations.</i>

1051
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,760
I come here today
as the representative of two worlds.

1052
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,480
The land and the sea.

1053
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:00,240
<i>And I stand here as proof...
change is coming to both.</i>

1054
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,840
<i>And I'm calling for global unity
for a global crisis.</i>

1055
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:09,600
<i>To finally bring harmony between us
and the natural balance of our world.</i>

1056
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,880
<i>Atlantis stands ready
to help contribute</i>

1057
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,560
<i>its science and technology.</i>

1058
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,280
<i>And with your knowledge of the air,
and our knowledge of the seas</i>

1059
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,880
<i>together we can write
the next chapter in our story</i>

1060
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,680
<i>rather than its ending.</i>

1061
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,440
<i>Sometimes it's gonna seem like
our differences are too extreme</i>

1062
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,280
<i>but all we have to do
is look beneath the surface</i>

1063
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,256
<i>to see that we're all here
on this planet</i>

1064
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,160
<i>with the same goals and aspirations.</i>

1065
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,096
<i>- Even when our customs might...</i>
- Here you go.

1066
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,480
<i>- seem strange and unfamiliar.</i>
- Beer and a cheeseburger.

1067
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,320
Extra greasy, like you asked for.

1068
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,280
<i>And by overcoming our prejudices</i>

1069
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,120
<i>we'll become stronger
and learn more about ourselves.</i>

1070
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,360
<i>We can seize this moment to create
a better more hopeful future</i>

1071
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,640
<i>for our children, and our families.</i>

1072
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,800
<i>My name is Arthur Curry.</i>

1073
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,320
<i>I'm the rightful sovereign
of the undersea nation of Atlantis.</i>

1074
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,840
<i>I'm a father, a brother...</i>

1075
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,840
a warrior and a friend.

1076
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,760
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1077
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,200
I am Aquaman.
