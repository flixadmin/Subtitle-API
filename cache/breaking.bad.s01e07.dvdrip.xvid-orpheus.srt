1
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:07,368
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:10,059
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,724
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,655
remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,649
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school is also receiving

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,038
our highest attention.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,956
Rest assured, no stone
will go unturned

8
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:25,165
in our search for the person or persons
responsible for this.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,732
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

10
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:31,320
You're talking like you haven't
caught anybody yet.

11
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:33,966
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

12
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,782
There is no indication that
this individual was selling drugs.

13
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:41,728
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

14
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,330
not in the school.

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,274
And he's
since been fired.

16
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,984
I heard he had a record.

17
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,446
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

18
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,603
- Why wasn't there a background check?
- There was one.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,878
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,509
You better be doing more than that.
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

21
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,758
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

22
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,809
That's not our thinking
at this time.

23
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,511
We are looking at others who had access,
not limited to the maintenance staff.

24
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:10,997
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?

25
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,268
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

26
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,527
We haven't been able
to establish a date or time,

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,262
but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

28
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,498
Whoever took it had a key?

29
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:24,676
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

30
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:28,667
At this time I'm not able to discuss
the details, but what I can tell you

31
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:31,793
is that we have some very good people
working very hard on this case.

32
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,484
I'm sorry, Officer.
But that sounds like double-talk.

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:37,523
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

34
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:40,603
Really, we are giving you
all the information we have.

35
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:44,140
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

36
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:46,475
Yeah, dogs,
and metal detectors,

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,439
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

38
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,870
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada.

39
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,731
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

40
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,496
And the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

41
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:01,427
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

42
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:04,929
No. Please.
No one said anything about LSD.

43
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,370
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

44
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,716
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

45
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:19,290
And I would like someone
to give us some specifics.

46
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,794
Walt?

47
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,050
Yeah.

48
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,286
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

49
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:31,129
But as he's chair
of the science department,

50
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:34,402
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

51
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:38,397
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,119
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

53
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:52,290
- Please.
- Yes.

54
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,614
And thank you.

55
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:05,465
The inventory list for
the missing labware is as follows:

56
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,466
one 5,000 milliliter

57
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,931
round bottom boiling flask,

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,883
one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

59
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,889
two full-face respirators,

60
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,549
some sep funnels,

61
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,102
a sill head with
a thermometer holder...

62
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,460
Ow, my knee.

63
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,955
Where... did that come from?

64
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,127
And why was it
so damn good?

65
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,102
Because it was illegal.

66
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,195
The basement.

67
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,751
Unfinished, of course.

68
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,710
But just look
at all this space.

69
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:32,068
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

70
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,908
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

71
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,926
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighborhood.

72
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,317
Big lawns
and shade tress.

73
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,735
Walking distance
to the country club.

74
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,041
What happened there?

75
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,755
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

76
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,364
You know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing,

77
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,556
brand-new, right around the corner.

78
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,247
Hi.

79
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:09,462
Hi.

80
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,241
It's by appointment only.

81
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm here to see the owner.

82
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,508
He's in the...

83
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,818
recreational vehicle.

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,154
Yo, it's appointment only!

85
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,907
How you feeling?

86
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,762
About as good
as you look.

87
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,498
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

88
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,784
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

89
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,052
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

90
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:02,124
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

91
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:06,011
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

92
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,786
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

93
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,576
Are you selling your house?

94
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,484
I got two dudes
that turned into

95
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,242
raspberry slushie and
flushed down my toilet.

96
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,787
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

97
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:21,055
The whole damn house
has got to be haunted by now.

98
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,709
You didn't actually
go see Tuco?

99
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:26,755
Here.

100
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,567
That is seventeen-five.

101
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:34,779
Your half of the 35, 000.

102
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:38,053
Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours.

103
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:39,614
You've earned it.

104
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,329
You got this money
from Tuco.

105
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,174
Yeah.

106
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,918
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

107
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:48,135
- We made a deal.
- You made a deal?

108
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,918
- That's right.
- Wait.

109
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:53,183
Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

110
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,759
You see what he did to me?

111
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,408
Because I think that
we can do business together.

112
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,605
We came to
an understanding.

113
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:02,034
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

114
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,166
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

115
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,580
Now just imagine
making that every week.

116
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,314
That's right.

117
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,684
Two pounds a week.
35, 000 a pound.

118
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:15,527
Without even talking to me,
you told...

119
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,699
this insane ass clown

120
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,359
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

121
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,944
that we would give him
two pounds a week?

122
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,645
We'll just scale up
our operation.

123
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:29,306
- We'll add a few more hours...
- Don't talk to me about hours.

124
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:32,829
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

125
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:36,481
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

126
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,563
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

127
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,052
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

128
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,862
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs...

129
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,322
- Smurfs?
- Dudes who go to the drugstores

130
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,188
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

131
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,561
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,681
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

133
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,522
All right.

134
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:03,282
Of course you would have known that
if you would have just asked me.

135
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,845
Well, here we are again.

136
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,583
Here we are.

137
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,712
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:13,246
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

139
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,977
How goes it?

140
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,340
It's great...

141
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,229
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

142
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:24,333
The baby shower's next week.
It'll be good to...

143
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,336
It'll be good
to have a day that's...

144
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,128
just about Skyler.

145
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,298
Very nice.

146
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,216
Thank you.

147
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,985
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

148
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:36,980
Yeah.

149
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,033
- How do you feel?
- Oh, okay.

150
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,544
You know,
pretty decent actually.

151
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,797
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

152
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,614
And he's even more...

153
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,823
physical.

154
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,276
More physical?

155
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,566
Well... sexual.

156
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,467
Frisky, actually.

157
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,176
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

158
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,693
Sure, I'll take that.

159
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:05,994
Right, Walt?

160
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,094
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

161
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:13,150
Realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the anti-emetics tuned right.

162
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,547
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo

163
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,859
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

164
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,222
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

165
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,472
I've been wondering about...

166
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,969
alternative medicine.

167
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,177
I mean, Eastern healing.

168
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:31,519
You know, holistic.

169
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:34,052
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

170
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,231
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

171
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,082
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

172
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:43,014
a better comfort,
is fine by me.

173
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,497
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

174
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,057
It doesn't make
any real difference.

175
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,615
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

176
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,482
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

177
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,020
What?

178
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,503
A junkyard?

179
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,801
Let me guess,
you picked this place?

180
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,413
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

181
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:38,353
This is like... a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

182
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:42,276
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Oh, look at me."

183
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,420
So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

184
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,220
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

185
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,427
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

186
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,157
Nice and public.

187
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,452
Open 24 hours.

188
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,891
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

189
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,029
Hell, why not the mall?

190
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:06,434
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey! It's time for the meet."

191
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,375
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

192
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,854
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

193
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,334
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco

194
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,127
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

195
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,301
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

196
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,572
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

197
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,941
I'm okay.

198
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,669
Nah, I'm no pussy.

199
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,474
I'm good.

200
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,287
Mr. Clean and his boy.

201
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,438
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

202
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:09,441
Respect, ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

203
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:16,080
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

204
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,798
What, they close
the mall or something?

205
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,978
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

206
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,545
That's it?
That's all you got?

207
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,930
We had some
production problems.

208
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,257
Point five-three.

209
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:36,433
I thought you was
a player.

210
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,787
You told me two pounds,

211
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,930
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

212
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,587
17½...

213
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,019
minus the half
for wasting my time.

214
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, come on.

215
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:02,187
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

216
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,655
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

217
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,889
I want all of it.

218
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,772
70 grand.

219
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,359
What did you say?

220
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,485
You like this product,
and you want more.

221
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,580
Consider it
a capital investment.

222
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,987
Loco bald motherfucker.

223
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,917
52½.
25 points vig.

224
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:37,604
Vig?

225
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,753
Interest. Weekly.

226
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,145
Okay.

227
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,517
That's...

228
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:52,299
$65, 625 with interest.

229
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,489
- 1.875 pounds.
- No.

230
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,859
2 pounds.
Next Friday.

231
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,143
And no production problems.

232
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,729
Can you handle 4 pounds?

233
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,327
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

234
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,257
But owing me money...

235
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:16,259
that's bad.

236
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:41,115
What did you just do?

237
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:48,203
4 pounds.

238
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:51,269
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

239
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,569
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

240
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,398
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

241
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,799
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

242
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:03,798
We're going to make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace,

243
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,869
then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

244
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:10,282
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

245
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,975
So you do have a plan.

246
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,045
Yeah, Mr. White!

247
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:17,234
Yeah, science!

248
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,863
Okay.

249
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,720
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

250
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:29,783
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

251
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,169
"One autotransformer,
6 liters an...

252
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,151
hy... hydrous
methyl... methylamine,

253
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,994
two 35 M&M tube furnaces..."

254
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,820
That's MM: millimeter.

255
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:46,087
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

256
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:48,612
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

257
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:51,165
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

258
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,931
You know what?
Count me out.

259
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,345
I'm leaving town.

260
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,456
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something...

261
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,387
Jesse, Jesse,
listen to me.

262
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,934
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

263
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,132
What are you doing?

264
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,277
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

265
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,300
but what kind of life will it be?

266
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,403
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

267
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,244
"I can't do this, " of never once
believing in yourself?

268
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,475
- I don't know.
- Listen.

269
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,323
These things?

270
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:22,925
We need them.

271
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,951
And only you
can get them for us.

272
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,064
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

273
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:40,155
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

274
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:44,626
Now, you already know that because
when you watch this 20 years from now,

275
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,400
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

276
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:49,248
I know it is amazing.

277
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:52,365
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

278
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,262
Anyway,

279
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:58,317
welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda!

280
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:00,208
Esmeralda?

281
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,991
Esmeralda.

282
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:04,262
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

283
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:07,178
Now, that is your wonderful,

284
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,848
handsome older brother.

285
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,047
Show her, older brother,
your face.

286
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,894
Okay. Not right up the nose.

287
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,092
Not...
Back to me.

288
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,679
There's your mommy!

289
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:22,252
Hello, Mommy!

290
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:25,634
And look!
There you are, Esmeralda!

291
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,333
Wake up, baby!

292
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,307
Time to party!

293
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:31,149
Easy.

294
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:33,718
Believe it or not,
Esmeralda,

295
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,671
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

296
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:40,052
And I believe, Hank,
that that was around the time

297
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,431
that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

298
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,002
Yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

299
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:48,439
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

300
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,695
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

301
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,222
Say hello to your daughter.

302
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,903
Holly, I am very proud of you,

303
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:08,838
and I think about you all the time.

304
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,670
Wherever you go,

305
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,052
whatever you do in life,

306
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,794
always know
that you have a family

307
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,254
who loves you very,
very much.

308
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:30,082
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

309
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,694
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

310
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,171
Oh, Carmen, it's...
Oh, look.

311
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,854
Look at that.
It's adorable.

312
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:41,173
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

313
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,676
You're so welcome, honey.

314
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,135
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

315
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,619
From me.

316
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,407
And Hank.

317
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,939
What nice wrapping paper.

318
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,281
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

319
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,394
I do.

320
00:18:58,912 --> 00:18:59,820
Okay.

321
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,191
Let's see what this is.

322
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,660
Exciting.

323
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:08,518
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

324
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,577
It's a...

325
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:18,417
a tiara.

326
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,962
Marie, is this...

327
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:28,103
White gold and several carats'
worth of zircons.

328
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,574
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

329
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:33,948
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

330
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,655
But it's so...
It's really...

331
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,611
It's... sparkly.

332
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,962
Sparkly! Like wow!
Thank you.

333
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,718
Hey, listen, Walt...

334
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,911
You got anything
stronger than beer?

335
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:50,014
It's just gor...
Oh, it's great.

336
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,116
I love it.
Thank you.

337
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,259
Thank you, sweetie,
thank you.

338
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,056
Sorry, man.

339
00:19:57,131 --> 00:20:00,624
You know, after 200 presents,
it just gets kind of old.

340
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,360
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

341
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:12,322
I got just the thing
to go with that.

342
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,017
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

343
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,966
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

344
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,117
You mind
if I have one?

345
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:26,320
You think it's a good idea?

346
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,780
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

347
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,732
Okay. You got me there.

348
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,370
Thanks.

349
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,713
Cuban.

350
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,838
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

351
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,632
Now, I was
under the impression...

352
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,834
that these were illegal, hmm?

353
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,163
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

354
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,586
tastes the sweetest,
doesn't it?

355
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,032
It's funny, isn't it?

356
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,532
How we draw that line.

357
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,659
Yeah?

358
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,283
What line is that?

359
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:20,519
Well, what's legal,
what's illegal,

360
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,584
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

361
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,671
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

362
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,023
we'd be breaking the law.

363
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:32,723
Another year, we'd be okay.

364
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,853
Who knows what
will be legal next year?

365
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,283
You mean like pot?

366
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:44,424
Yeah.

367
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,986
Like pot. Or...

368
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,253
whatever.

369
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:52,896
Cocaine? Heroin?

370
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,626
I'm just saying
it's arbitrary.

371
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,996
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

372
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:03,660
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

373
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:07,644
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

374
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:11,641
"It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

375
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:15,508
Shit, buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

376
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:19,520
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

377
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:23,089
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

378
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,222
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

379
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:31,823
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

380
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:35,301
Yeah.

381
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,594
Nice party.

382
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:55,793
A tiara.

383
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,808
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

384
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,981
Yeah.

385
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:07,355
You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.

386
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,641
I mean, that thing
must have cost, like, what,

387
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:12,541
$500 or $600.

388
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:18,645
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

389
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:19,906
You sure?

390
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,348
She's bound to find out.

391
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:26,636
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie more than

392
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,854
a white gold baby tiara.

393
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:37,324
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli

394
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,210
about alternative medicine.

395
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,756
Don't worry. I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

396
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:45,110
What I mean is that maybe
there is something to it.

397
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,866
Here. Look.

398
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:52,924
They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

399
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,824
Healing ceremony.

400
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,950
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

401
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,652
I'm not saying
that I believe in it, but...

402
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:04,201
you know,
it might be an experience.

403
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:07,051
Really?

404
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:08,838
You?

405
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:11,316
In a sweat lodge?

406
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,537
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

407
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,936
coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it.

408
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:19,542
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

409
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:20,734
Okay.

410
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:32,529
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

411
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,307
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

412
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:39,011
- Okay.
- Right.

413
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,523
70-millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent.

414
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,335
This is excellent.
Very good work.

415
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,199
- Damn straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

416
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,984
Electrolytically
produced, yes?

417
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,853
Yeah, like you asked. I mean,

418
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,867
this crap wasn't easy to get.

419
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,611
It was expensive.

420
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,777
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

421
00:24:57,782 --> 00:24:59,670
I don't see the methylamine.

422
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:02,999
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

423
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,332
What kind of trouble?

424
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:08,346
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

425
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,538
But this methylamine...

426
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:12,377
not so easy.

427
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:14,468
They got it locked down tight.

428
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:17,962
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

429
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,516
But they want 10 grand.

430
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,806
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

431
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,813
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

432
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:29,815
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

433
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,260
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

434
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:37,260
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

435
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,694
They got guards
and security cameras,

436
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,437
big ass steel doors.

437
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:44,457
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

438
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:45,922
What?

439
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:03,680
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

440
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:06,732
Yeah?

441
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,517
How are we
going to do that?

442
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,997
With this.

443
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:30,427
So what's this
stuff called again?

444
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:34,669
Thermite.

445
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:37,338
And that will
cut through a lock?

446
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:40,348
Because this is supposed
to be one big ass lock.

447
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:42,485
In World War II,

448
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:47,088
the Germans had an artillery piece,
it's the biggest in the world,

449
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,205
called the Gustav Gun,

450
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,000
and it weighed
a thousand tons.

451
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:56,105
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

452
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,737
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

453
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,935
I mean, you could
drop bombs on it

454
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:08,532
every day for a month
without ever disabling it.

455
00:27:09,646 --> 00:27:12,546
But you drop
a commando,

456
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,704
one man,

457
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:17,057
with just a bag of this...

458
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,816
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

459
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:25,241
and destroy that gun forever.

460
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:29,339
Jeez!

461
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,132
So yes.

462
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:39,616
I think it will cut through any lock
we're likely to find.

463
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,903
You'd like to return this?

464
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,550
It's very nice, but yes.

465
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:47,638
Well, it is from
the store, isn't it?

466
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:49,993
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

467
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,553
Do you happen
to have a receipt?

468
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,382
No. I don't.
It was a gift.

469
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:57,065
A gift.

470
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,279
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

471
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,173
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

472
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:07,992
Excuse me?

473
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,295
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

474
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,902
Come with me, please.

475
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:19,424
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

476
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,637
Please do.

477
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,303
We'll be here.

478
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:28,059
Look, I...

479
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,939
I've never stolen anything
in my life, all right?

480
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,507
I told you.

481
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:37,294
That tiara was a gift.
A baby shower gift.

482
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,467
So who gave it to you, then?

483
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:44,811
- I don't think I have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

484
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:46,608
You can talk to the police,

485
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,444
and I can tell them how
my daughter-in-law remembers

486
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,913
showing this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

487
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:56,050
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

488
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,204
So there.

489
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,672
Oh, yeah?

490
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:01,823
Then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

491
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:05,005
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

492
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:08,027
without a shred,
without a modicum of evidence,

493
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:11,942
illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman

494
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,204
in a dank storeroom.

495
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:17,874
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

496
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:22,051
Furthermore, I'm not getting
enough air back here.

497
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,122
I don't think I can breathe.

498
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,709
Oh, my God.

499
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:29,185
Oh, no.
I'm going into labor.

500
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:30,611
Yes, I...

501
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,224
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

502
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:47,624
Marie? It's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

503
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,338
I need to talk to you
immediately.

504
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:56,101
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

505
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:59,440
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

506
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:03,128
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

507
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:04,915
Wait till he passes.

508
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,645
Okay, it's clear.

509
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,568
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

510
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:19,208
Then you go to another store.

511
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:22,240
- If this is all they had, wrong place.
- Just put it on.

512
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:23,959
Of course you can...

513
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,295
Okay.
This is it.

514
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:38,936
Oh, God.

515
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:57,892
- Dawm. Where... Duck. Duck.
- What?

516
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:04,125
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

517
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:05,876
Oh, God.

518
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:10,408
He's going to the crapper.

519
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:11,494
Oh, God.

520
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:16,003
- Carry your bag.
- What? What are you doing?

521
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,357
Okay, there is it.

522
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,171
Is this going to be loud?

523
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,543
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

524
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,062
Stand back.

525
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:03,407
Jesus!

526
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:21,383
What's going on?

527
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,957
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't know.

528
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:30,315
- God!
- What?

529
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:33,498
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

530
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:45,421
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

531
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:48,098
How are we going to
take this thing out?

532
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,880
- How is it going to be any different?
- Can I just try it?

533
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,443
- Fine, fine, go ahead.
- Jesus. Okay.

534
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,015
All right.

535
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,379
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it, okay?

536
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,408
I'm the king.
I'm the king.

537
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:51,355
No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

538
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,449
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

539
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:03,163
We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
I tell you that.

540
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,917
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

541
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:16,656
You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
You got to wait for me.

542
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:18,501
Okay.

543
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:21,716
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

544
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:24,443
Easy, easy, easy.

545
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,832
Okay.

546
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,835
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

547
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:31,375
Shit.

548
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,685
Yo, I don't know.

549
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:36,179
I'll make damn sure
she doesn't.

550
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:40,655
Good call, yo.

551
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,999
All right.

552
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,917
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

553
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,027
We'll need to run it
two more hours

554
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,363
to have enough
to make 4½ pounds.

555
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:26,892
4½? Not 4?

556
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:29,190
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

557
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:34,383
4½ pounds puts us
$44, 000 ahead...

558
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:35,623
each.

559
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,287
Right on, man.

560
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:39,401
Right on.

561
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:42,246
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

562
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:45,069
we could make
4½ pounds a week for...

563
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,181
well, for the foreseeable future.

564
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:52,377
How long is
that going to be?

565
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:55,545
I mean in your situation.

566
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,567
How much
cash do you need?

567
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:01,609
More.

568
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,198
Someone's in my yard.

569
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:40,285
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon an open house?

570
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,903
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

571
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,226
I don't care how you do it. Just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

572
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:49,073
- Yeah.
- Go.

573
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:20,592
You know you can't
duck me forever.

574
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,571
What?

575
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,634
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

576
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,067
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

577
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:30,347
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

578
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:33,261
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

579
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:36,783
Marie, I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

580
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,391
That tiara.

581
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:46,704
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

582
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,274
What were you doing
at Zachary's?

583
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:51,710
I was returning it.

584
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:54,654
You were returning it.

585
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,542
Why would you return it?

586
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:58,886
It just wasn't...

587
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:02,850
Marie, what is wrong with you?

588
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:04,387
Can you please tell me that?

589
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:07,397
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

590
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,485
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

591
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,668
That means that

592
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:21,276
I have no idea what the hell
you're even talking about.

593
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,421
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

594
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,121
The shop...
The shoplifting.

595
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:29,785
No idea?

596
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,045
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

597
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:40,052
I can't really admit to something

598
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,887
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

599
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:05,168
Don't forget to sign in.

600
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,909
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

601
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,863
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

602
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:36,526
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

603
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:39,892
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

604
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,401
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, bitch. You got that?

605
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,424
Is that sinking in?
Now beat it.

606
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:47,947
All of you all.
House is not for sale.

607
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:49,871
Get the hell out!

608
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,278
So how was it?

609
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:38,159
Was it a...

610
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,595
an experience?

611
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:42,014
Yeah.

612
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:44,938
It was definitely
an experience.

613
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,384
What's that smell?

614
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,637
Yeah. It's...

615
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:59,969
sacred Navajo herbs and...

616
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,113
Hey,
is everything okay?

617
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:20,603
No. Not really.

618
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:24,965
Actually, not at all.

619
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:31,509
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

620
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:32,531
Yeah.

621
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,407
Well, she stole it.

622
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:37,290
Yeah.

623
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:41,140
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

624
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,120
Oh, my God.

625
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:47,059
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

626
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,125
I don't know
what to do.

627
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:54,855
Oh, well.

628
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,535
People sometimes do things
for their families.

629
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:05,350
People sometimes do things
for their families?

630
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:08,390
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

631
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:11,087
Yeah.

632
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,378
That must have
been some sweat lodge.

633
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:20,147
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

634
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:25,948
What would you do
if it were me?

635
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,607
What do you mean
if it were you?

636
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:33,682
If it were me,
what would you do?

637
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:37,826
Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?

638
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:50,342
You don't want to find out.

639
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,771
Do you want
something to eat?

640
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:09,290
No, thanks.

641
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:28,002
What is this shit?
This is blue.

642
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:33,876
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

643
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:36,987
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

644
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,019
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

645
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,009
Blue, yellow, pink.

646
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,034
Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

647
00:44:02,522 --> 00:44:03,645
4.6.

648
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:06,615
Come on.

649
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:11,043
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

650
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,638
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

651
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:16,467
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

652
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:19,841
Just remember
who you're working for.

653
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,260
What did you say?

654
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:28,300
I'm just saying they got to know
that they're working for you.

655
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:31,045
Like they don't
already know that?

656
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,922
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

657
00:44:35,282 --> 00:44:37,592
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

658
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,613
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

659
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,765
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

660
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,475
No. Come on, Tuco.
I'm just saying.

661
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,744
No, you're just
speaking for me!

662
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:52,554
Like I ain't got the damn sense
to speak for myself!

663
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:56,217
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

664
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:57,789
Tuco.

665
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:05,179
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

666
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:14,877
Heisenberg says relax.

667
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:18,747
Orale, homes.

668
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:22,999
I'm relaxed.

669
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,284
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

670
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,502
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

671
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:49,506
Yeah. That's messed up.

672
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,242
Okay, Heisenberg!

673
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,434
Next week.
