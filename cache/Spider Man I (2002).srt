00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,136
<font color=#80ffff><i>The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.</i></font>

00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,377
<font color=#80ffff><i>If somebody said it was
a happy little tale...</i></font>

5
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,939
<font color=#80ffff><i>if somebody told you I was just

<font color=#80ffff><i>But let me assure you,</i></font>

8
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,626
<font color=#80ffff><i>this like any story worth telling...</i></font>

9
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,169
<font color=#80ffff><i>is all about a girl.</i></font>

10
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,866
<font color=#80ffff><i>That girl.</i></font>

11
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,451
<font color=#80ffff><i>The girl next door.</i></font>

00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,392
<font color=#80ffff><i>Mary Jane Watson.</i></font>

00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,582
<font color=#80ffff><i>The woman I've loved since

14
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,214
<font color=#80ffff><i>I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.</i></font>

15
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,423
<font color=#80ffff><i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i></font>

16
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:45,880
Hey!

17
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:47,181
Stop the bus!

18
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,595
<font color=#80ffff><i>That's me.</i></font>

19
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,982
Tell him to stop! Please!

20
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,993
Stop!

21
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,557
Hey! Stop the bus!

22
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,599
Stop the bus!

23
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:59,025
He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

24
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,491
Catch a cab, Parker!

25
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,510
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,422
What a geek!

27
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,536
Don't even think about it.

28
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,607
You're so lame, Parker.

29
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,262
Would you date him?

30
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,586
Midtown High seniors.

31
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,645
No wandering.

32
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,538
Proceed direct. Knock it off.

33
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,374
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.

34
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,501
We're guests of Columbia
University's Science Department.

35
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,143
So behave accordingly.

36
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,466
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

37
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,925
Come on, people, stay together.

38
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,349
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

39
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,459
Where were you?
Checking out the library.

40
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,328
Looking at the books.
Yeah, right.

41
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,064
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

42
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:14,906
Why?

43
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,526
The entrance is right there.

44
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,405
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

45
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,154
What, you want me to trade in
my car for a Jetta...

46
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:27,219
because you flunked out of every
private school I sent you to?

47
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,274
It wasn't for me.

48
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,556
Of course it was.

49
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,725
Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.

50
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,314
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

51
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,336
It's just...

52
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,906
Just what, Harry?

53
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,507
Forget it.

54
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:43,773
Pete!

55
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,514
Hi, Harry.
Hey, man. What's up?

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,436
Harry.

57
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,420
Won't you be needing this?

58
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:50,863
Thanks, Dad.

59
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,771
Peter, may I introduce
my father, Norman Osborn.

60
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,552
I've heard so much about you.

61
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,011
Great honor to meet you, sir.

62
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,125
Harry says you're a science whiz.

63
00:05:59,276 --> 00:05:59,931
You know,

64
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:02,112
I'm something of a scientist myself.

65
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,449
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really brilliant.

66
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,729
And you understood it?

67
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:08,702
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

68
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,816
Impressive.

69
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,914
Your parents must be very proud.

70
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,881
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

71
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,713
Hey, you two! Let's move!

72
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,074
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:19,785
Hope to see you again.
Yeah.

74
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,455
He doesn't seem so bad.

75
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,144
Not if you're a genius.

76
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,196
I think he wants to adopt you.

77
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,670
There are over 32,000,

78
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,391
known species of spiders in the world.

79
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,550
They're in the order <i>Araneae,</i>

80
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,540
divided into three suborders.

81
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:38,769
That's amazing!

82
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,112
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

83
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,336
It's unreal.

84
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,477
Arachnids,

85
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:47,961
from all three groups possess,

86
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:51,383
varying strengths which help
them in their constant search for food.

87
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,775
For example,

88
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,402
the Delena spider,

89
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,104
family <i>Sparassidae</i>...

90
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,822
has the ability,

91
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:00,044
to jump to catch its prey.

92
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,076
For the school paper?

93
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,541
Next we have,

94
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,084
the net web spider,

95
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,224
family <i>Filistatidae</i>...

96
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,137
genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.

97
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,883
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web

98
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,382
whose strands have a tensile strength,

99
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,430
proportionately equal to a type
of high tension wire

100
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,246
used in bridge building.

101
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,488
Leave him alone.
Or what?

102
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,931
Or his father will fire your father.

103
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,314
What's Daddy gonna do?

104
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:32,369
Sue me?

105
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,026
What is going on?

106
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:36,903
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

107
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:38,114
I kid you not.

108
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,871
This grass spider...
Let's go.

109
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,991
Hunts using a set of reflexes

110
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,808
with nerve conduction velocity so fast,

111
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,510
that some researchers believe
that it almost borders on precognition.

112
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,720
An early awareness of danger.
Those guys are jerks.

113
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,847
A spider-sense.

114
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,936
Hey, look at that spider.

115
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,944
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

116
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,474
It's a defense mechanism.

117
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,012
Peter,

118
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,359
what makes you think
I would want to know that?

119
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,412
Who wouldn't?

120
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,935
Over five painstaking years,

121
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,113
Columbia's genetic research facility...

122
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:12,355
You gonna talk to her now?

123
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,459
No. Come on. You talk to her.

124
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,459
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

125
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,433
we have now begun what
was once thought impossible.

126
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,572
Disgusting.

127
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,945
Yeah, hateful little things.

128
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,713
I love them!

129
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,274
Yeah, me too.

130
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,789
You know,

131
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,187
spiders can change their color...

132
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,711
to blend into their environment.

133
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:36,171
Really?

134
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,215
Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.

135
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:41,404
Cool.
Yeah.

136
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,475
Transfer RNA to encode
an entirely new genome

137
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,943
combining the genetic information
rom all three spiders

138
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:48,766
into these,

139
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,282
15 genetically designed super-spiders.

140
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:53,784
There's 14.

141
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,846
I beg your pardon?

142
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,442
One's missing.

143
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:58,544
Yeah.

144
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,543
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

145
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:08,473
Do you know that this is
the largest electron microscope

146
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,882
on the Eastern Seaboard?

147
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,270
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

148
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,930
Let's go talk about how we listen.

149
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:20,715
Now,

150
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:23,596
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

151
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,314
but at Midtown High...
112.5

152
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,229
Hey.

153
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,022
Could I take your picture?

154
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,775
I need one with a student in it.

155
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:39,776
Sure, yeah.

156
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,943
Great.
Where do you want me?

157
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,537
Over here?

158
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,083
Yeah. Yeah that's great.

159
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,772
Don't make me look ugly.

160
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,060
That's impossible.

161
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,754
Perfect.

162
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,042
Is that good?
Great.

163
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,682
That's great.

164
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,189
MJ, let's go!

165
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:22,777
Wait.

166
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,150
Thanks!

167
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,043
Parker,

168
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:40,626
let's do it.

169
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,480
We solved the horizon glide,

170
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:01,243
and the multi-G balance issues.

171
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,527
I've already seen the glider.

172
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,269
That's not what I'm here for.

173
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,545
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

174
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,296
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

175
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:13,244
Norman.

176
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,349
Mr. Osborn.

177
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,093
Always a pleasure to have our board
of directors pay us a little visit.

178
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,722
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

179
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,647
We tried vapor inhalation
with rogue subjects,

180
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,393
they showed an 800% increase in strength!

181
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,319
800%? That's excellent.
Any side effects?

182
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,725
In one trial, yes.

183
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,678
It was an aberration.

184
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,546
All the tests since
then have been successful.

185
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,891
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened?

186
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,242
What were the side effects?

187
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,351
Violence,

188
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:38,765
aggression...

189
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,765
and insanity.

190
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,148
And what do you recommend?

191
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:43,679
That was only one test.

192
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,776
With the exception of Dr. Stromm,

193
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,969
our entire staff certifies the product

194
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,488
ready for human testing.

195
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:50,946
Dr. Stromm?

196
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,568
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

197
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,414
Back to formula?

198
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,459
Dr. Osborn.

199
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,184
I'm gonna be frank with you.

200
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,921
I never supported your program.

201
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,395
We have my predecessor
to thank for that.

202
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,466
Norman,

203
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,789
the general gave
the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace

204
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,332
to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

205
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,348
They test in two weeks.

206
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,726
And if your so-called performance
enhancers have not had a...

207
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,676
successful human trial by that date,

208
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,814
I'm gonna pull your funding.

209
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:25,705
I'm going to give it to them.

210
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,978
Gentlemen. Ladies.

211
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,495
And the Lord said, Let there be light.

212
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,663
And voilà!

213
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,297
There is light.

214
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,257
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

215
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,753
Good boy. God will be thrilled.

216
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,380
Just don't fall on your ass.

217
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,552
I'm already on my ass, May.

218
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:54,053
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after...

219
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:57,181
after 35 years,
what else would you call it?

220
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,787
I am on my ass.

221
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,437
Hand me that dish. The green one.

222
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:04,093
The corporation is
downsizing the people and...

223
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,866
upsizing their profits.

224
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,937
Ben, you'll get
another job somewhere.

225
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:11,362
Well...

226
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,544
let's look in the paper and see.

227
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,787
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

228
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,600
Computer...

229
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,940
Computer salesman,

230
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,293
computer engineer, computer analyst.

231
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:26,409
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

232
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,879
May, I'm 68 years old.

233
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:32,644
I'm too old for computers and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

234
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,050
I love you.

235
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,731
And Peter loves you.

236
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,234
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

237
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,142
We've been down-and-out before.

238
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,002
But somehow, we survived.

239
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:44,080
Yeah.

240
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,063
Hi, sweetie.

241
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:46,897
You're just...

242
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,328
Just in time for dinner.

243
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,234
Hey.

244
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,080
How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

245
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,240
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

246
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,122
You won't have a bite?

247
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,685
No thanks. Had a bite.

248
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,296
Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?

249
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,319
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

250
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,490
What's that all about?

251
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,494
<i>In this recombination lab,</i>

252
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,290
<i>we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome</i>

253
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,687
<i>combining the genetic
information from all three spiders</i>

254
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:43,062
<i>into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

255
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,220
Dr. Osborn, please.

256
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,740
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

257
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,408
The data just doesn't justify this test.

258
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,394
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.

259
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,158
We can't do this.

260
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,210
Don't be a coward.

261
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,746
Risks are part of laboratory science.

262
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,062
Let me reschedule,

263
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:18,667
with a proper medical staff
and a volunteer.

264
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,033
I mean if you just give me two weeks.
Two weeks?

265
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:22,480
In two weeks,

266
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,740
we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

267
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:26,956
Sometimes,

268
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,701
you gotta do things yourself.

269
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,960
Get me the Promachloraperazine.

270
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,039
For what?

271
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,032
It begins catalyzation, when
the vapor hits the bloodstream.

272
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,361
40,000 years of evolution

273
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,814
and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

274
00:15:58,454 --> 00:15:59,572
That's cold.

275
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,101
Norman?

276
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,550
Norman!

277
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:06,738
Norman!

278
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,485
My God.

279
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,276
Oh my God!

280
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:20,789
Norman?

281
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,000
My God, Norman!

282
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:27,392
Norman!

283
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,227
Back to formula?

284
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:17,591
Weird.

285
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,817
Peter?
Yeah?

286
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,285
Are you alright?

287
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,689
I'm fine.

288
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,742
Any better this morning?
Any change?

289
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,861
Change?

290
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,067
Yep.

291
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,347
Big change.

292
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,611
Well, hurry up.

293
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,030
You're gonna be late.

294
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:46,930
Right.

295
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,609
Ok.

296
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,556
Goodness me!

297
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,390
Jeez.

298
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,798
I thought you were sick.

299
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,531
I got better.
You see?

300
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,520
Bye, guys.

301
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:20,747
You haven't eaten anything.
Have you got your lunch money?

302
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:21,479
Yeah, I got it.

303
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:24,610
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're
painting the kitchen right after school.

304
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:26,278
You got it?
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.

305
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:27,739
Don't start without me.

306
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,129
And don't start up with me.

307
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,409
Teenagers.

308
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,699
Raging hormones.
They never change.

309
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,900
Mary jane talk to me!

310
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,480
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

311
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:40,418
Just like her!

312
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,325
I have to go to school.
Who's stopping you?

313
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:01,963
Hi, MJ.

314
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,663
Hey, MJ.

315
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,528
I don't know if you realize this,
but we've...

316
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,333
we've been neighbors since I was 6,
and I was wondering if maybe...

317
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,771
we could get together sometime?
Hey M.J?

318
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,991
I got the car. Hop in.

319
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,161
Maybe do something fun?
Hi guys!

320
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,256
Or I don't know.
Come on.

321
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,032
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

322
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,319
Or not.

323
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,074
Sorry Parker, the bus is full!
Hey!

324
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:32,622
Hey!

325
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,207
Stop the bus!
Catch a cab!

326
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,296
Tell him to stop.

327
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,086
Check him out!
Dork!

328
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,754
Dad!

329
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,294
Dad!

330
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:06,340
Are you alright?

331
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,301
Harry.

332
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,709
What are you doing on the floor?

333
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,287
I don't know.

334
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,842
Have you been there all night?

335
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,113
Last night I was...

336
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,164
What?

337
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,820
I don't remember.
Mr. Osborn?

338
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,945
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

339
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,696
Sorry, my father's not feeling well.

340
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,947
Mr. Osborn...

341
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:35,609
Dr. Stromm is dead.

342
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:36,571
What?

343
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,827
They found his body
this morning in the lab.

344
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:40,682
He's been murdered, sir.

345
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,997
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,844
And the flight suit and the glider...

347
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,125
What about it?

348
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,429
It's been stolen, sir.

349
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,600
Great reflexes!

350
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:15,656
Thanks.

351
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,826
No problem.

352
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,117
Hey you...

353
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:20,244
have blue eyes.

354
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:22,173
I... Ididn't notice without your glasses.

355
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,355
You just get contacts?

356
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,214
Well,

357
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:33,287
see you.

358
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,383
What happened?

359
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,076
He's freaking weird.

360
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,648
Did you see that?

361
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,171
Parker?

362
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,849
It's a fight!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?

363
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,468
Flash, it was just an accident.

364
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:01,457
My fist breaking your
teeth, that's the accident.

365
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,888
Come on Flash, stop.

366
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:04,192
I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

367
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:05,640
I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.

368
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:06,919
Kick his ass.

369
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,091
Help him, Harry.

370
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,246
How'd he do that?

371
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,410
Which one?

372
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,003
He's all yours, man.

373
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,314
Flash, get up!

374
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,338
Jesus Parker, you are a freak.

375
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,062
Peter, that was amazing.

376
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,284
I'm out of here. Come on.

377
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,714
Peter.

378
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:52,420
Go, web!

379
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,490
Fly.

380
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,139
Up, up and away, web.

381
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:02,284
Shazam!

382
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:03,944
Go!

383
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,628
Go!

384
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,901
Go, web, go!

385
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,887
Tallyho.

386
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,916
Is she back with the beer yet?
What?

387
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,540
Come here, bring me some beer!

388
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,072
Get up off your ass!

389
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,293
I paid for beer...

390
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,818
Stop yelling!
Stop it!

391
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:35,368
You're as stupid as your mother.

392
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:36,323
Get away from me!

393
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,216
You are drunk, do you know that?

394
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,094
Where's she going?
Where you going?

395
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:40,853
Where you going?

396
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,459
Stop, look!

397
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:43,793
These dishes are not done.

398
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,348
Somebody's gotta do the dishes!

399
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,297
Why don't you do them?

400
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,705
Get in here little girl
and you do the dishes, now!

401
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,947
You do them. They're yours, anyway.
I'm going out!

402
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,596
Were you listening to that?

403
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,445
No.

404
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,974
Well I heard, but I was just...

405
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,619
taking out the trash.

406
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,133
I guess you can always hear us.

407
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:02,254
Well,

408
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,063
everybody shouts.

409
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,490
Your aunt and uncle don't.

410
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,545
They can scream
pretty good sometimes.

411
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,311
Listen,

412
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,115
MJ, about today

413
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,105
at school with Flash...

414
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,570
You really freaked us out.

415
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:18,828
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,039
Is he ok?

417
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,088
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

418
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,284
So where are you going
after you graduate?

419
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:33,698
I...

420
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,291
I wanna move into the city.

421
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,016
And hopefully...

422
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,685
get a job as a...

423
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,306
photographer.

424
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,329
Work my way through college.

425
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,392
What about you?

426
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,420
Headed for the city too.

427
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,592
Can't wait to get out of here.

428
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:55,896
I wanna...

429
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,685
What?

430
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,081
No, come on.

431
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:04,621
Try me.

432
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,332
I wanna...

433
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:08,762
Act...

434
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,491
on stage.

435
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,358
Really?

436
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,139
That's perfect.

437
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,841
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

438
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,807
Really?

439
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,716
Yeah.

440
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,615
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

441
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,645
Peter, that was first grade.

442
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:29,348
Well...

443
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,762
even so.

444
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,535
Sometimes...

445
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,121
you know people.

446
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,951
You can just...

447
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,552
see what's coming.

448
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,247
What do you see coming for you?

449
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:51,840
I don't know.

450
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,967
Whatever it is,

451
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:58,723
it's something I never felt before.

452
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:03,683
And...

453
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:05,655
what for me?

454
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:07,030
For you?

455
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:10,523
You're gonna light up Broadway.

456
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,000
You know,

457
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:20,586
you're taller than you look.

458
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,610
I hunch.

459
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,219
Don't.

460
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,461
Hey, MJ!

461
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,201
Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

462
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,115
Come on!

463
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,318
I gotta go.

464
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:40,241
Bye.

465
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,318
My God, it's gorgeous!
Yeah, right?

466
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,093
Look at it!
Hop in.

467
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,626
Oh my God! What a cool car!

468
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,110
Pretty tight?

469
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,982
Wait untill you hear the sound system.

470
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:55,055
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

471
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:57,952
Cool car.

472
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:29,474
Peter?

473
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,445
What's... What's going on in there?

474
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm exercising.

475
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:35,810
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

476
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:36,878
Well,

477
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:39,232
you're acting so strangely, Peter.

478
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,661
Ok. Thanks.

479
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,207
Something's bothering him.

480
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:16,470
Maybe he's too embarrassed
to tell me what it is.

481
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,752
Maybe I'm too embarrassed...

482
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,425
to ask him.

483
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,675
I just don't know anymore.

484
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,972
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

485
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:25,843
Yeah, wait Pete.

486
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,512
I'll drive you there, buddy.

487
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,557
No, I'll take the train.

488
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,014
No, no, no. I need the exercise.
Go on.

489
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:31,301
Go, go, go, go.

490
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:44,529
Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
No, wait a minute.

491
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,398
Peter we need... we need to talk.

492
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,991
We can talk later.

493
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,618
Well, we can talk now.

494
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,586
If you let me.

495
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,258
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

496
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,444
Because we haven't talked
at all for so long

497
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,694
your Aunt May and I don't
even know who you are anymore.

498
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,351
You shirk your chores.

499
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,797
You have all those weird experiments
in your room.

500
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,648
You start fights at school, you know.
I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

501
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:09,470
Well, you sure as hell finished it.

502
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:11,576
What was I supposed to do, run away?
No.

503
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,507
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

504
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,393
Pete, look.

505
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,310
You're changing.

506
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:19,116
I know, I went through exactly
the same thing at your age.

507
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,663
No. Not exactly.

508
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,093
Peter...

509
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,155
these are the years
when a man changes

510
00:35:25,383 --> 00:35:28,531
into the man he's gonna
become the rest of his life.

511
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,175
Just be careful who you change into.

512
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,288
This guy, Flash Thompson.

513
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:38,844
He probably deserved what happened.

514
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,520
But just because you can beat him up,

515
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,002
doesn't give you the right to.

516
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:46,215
Remember,

517
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:47,925
with great power,

518
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:50,377
comes great responsibility.

519
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,223
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
turn into some kind of criminal?

520
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,230
Quit worrying about me, ok?

521
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,435
Something's different.

522
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,603
I'll figure it out.

523
00:35:58,627 --> 00:36:00,204
Stop lecturing me, please.

524
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:02,482
I don't mean to lecture,
I don't mean to preach.

525
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,554
And I know I'm not your father...

526
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,236
Then stop pretending to be!

527
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,212
Right.

528
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,126
I'll pick you up here at 10.

529
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,118
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

530
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,832
One, two, three.

531
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:02,740
That's it!
Who's the man?

532
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:07,225
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

533
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,852
Ladies and gentlemen...

534
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,565
Give it up for Bone Saw McGraw!

535
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,521
For $3000,

536
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,607
is there no one here
man enough to stay in the ring

537
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:29,685
for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

538
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:33,912
Who?

539
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,271
I know who.

540
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,800
The Flying Dutchman!

541
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:43,145
Next.

542
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,804
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry

543
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:47,804
. Next.

544
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,124
No, no. Sign me up.

545
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:50,913
Ok.

546
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:53,747
You understand
the NYWL is not responsible

547
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,238
for any injury you may and

548
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:57,858
probably will sustain while
participating in said event?

549
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,277
And you are indeed participating
under your own free will?

550
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,070
Yes.

551
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,894
Down the hall to the ramp.

552
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,145
May God be with you.

553
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:05,491
Next.

554
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,046
Told you! Told you!

555
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,647
Winner!

556
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,007
Next victim!

557
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,092
Are you ready for more?

558
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,217
Bone Saw is ready!

559
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,037
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

560
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,716
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage

561
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,346
with Bone Saw McGraw,
the sum of $3000

562
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,858
will be paid to...

563
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,682
What's your name, kid?

564
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:43,323
The Human Spider.

565
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,699
The Human Spider, that's it?
That's the best you got?

566
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,480
Yeah.

567
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,756
That sucks.

568
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,664
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

569
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,029
the terrifying,

570
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,084
the deadly,

571
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,802
the amazing Spider-Man!

572
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,551
My name's The Human Spider.
I don't care, get out there.

573
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,291
No, he got my name wrong.
Get out there, you moron.

574
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,155
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

575
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,061
I hope you brought
your mommy with you.

576
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:19,224
We'll break you!
You'll need someone to cry to.

577
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:25,593
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one!

578
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,741
Oh my God!

579
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,989
My legs!

580
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,978
God. I can't feel my legs.

581
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:45,299
Kill! Kill! Kill!

582
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,675
Cage!

583
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,478
Hello? Guys?

584
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,484
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

585
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,099
Hey, listen.

586
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:08,248
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

587
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,353
Hey!

588
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,105
Unlock the thing!

589
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:12,399
Take the chain off!

590
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:13,946
Hey, freak show!

591
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,250
You're going, nowhere.

592
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,087
I got you for three minutes.

593
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,939
Three minutes of playtime.

594
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,753
What are you doing up there?
Staying away from you.

595
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,544
That's a cute outfit.

596
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:34,890
Did your husband give it to you?

597
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,082
Finish him off!

598
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,834
Smash him!

599
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,060
Hit him!
Harder!

600
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,083
Kick his spider ass!

601
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,715
Hit him!

602
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,939
One, two, three!

603
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,221
That's it! That's it!

604
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:27,194
Winner!

605
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,642
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion,

606
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,360
Spider-Man!

607
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,766
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

608
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,659
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

609
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,734
Now get out of here.

610
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,083
A hundred bucks?

611
00:41:54,107 --> 00:41:55,721
The ad said 3000.

612
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,686
Well, check it again, webhead.

613
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,880
It said three grand,

614
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:02,231
for three minutes.
And you pinned him in two.

615
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,536
For that, I give you 100
and you're lucky to get that.

616
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,482
I need that money.

617
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,233
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

618
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,693
Hey, what the hell?

619
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:22,209
Put the money in the bag.

620
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,139
Hurry up!

621
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,217
Hey! He stole the gate!

622
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:35,709
Stop that guy!

623
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,822
Stop him! He's got my money!

624
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,197
Thanks.

625
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,924
What the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

626
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,521
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

627
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,554
You could've taken that guy apart.

628
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:50,734
Now he's gonna get away
with my money.

629
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,913
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

630
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,314
Sir, you gotta get back.
Get back.

631
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,161
I can't see anything.
What happened?

632
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,002
Old dude, man.

633
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,054
Come on folks. Keep moving, please.

634
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:21,936
Please, keep moving. Let's go!

635
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,181
What happened?
Someone got hurt.

636
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:28,719
Excuse me.

637
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:30,554
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

638
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:31,297
Stay back.

639
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,527
Hey, stay back! Stay back!
That's my uncle!

640
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:36,644
What happened?

641
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,142
Carjacker. He's been shot.

642
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:40,316
But we just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

643
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,152
Uncle Ben?

644
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,379
Uncle Ben.

645
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,700
Uncle Ben?

646
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,405
Peter.

647
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,319
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

648
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,381
Peter.

649
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,113
They got the shooter.

650
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:30,879
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

651
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,658
We got three cars in pursuit.

652
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:35,306
Alright. Folks come on.
Come up. Move back.

653
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,789
Get a unit to the rear!

654
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,294
I got the back!

655
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,365
Who's there?

656
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,741
Don't hurt me.

657
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:01,950
Just give me a chance.

658
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:03,155
Just give me a chance!

659
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:04,328
What about my uncle?

660
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:05,829
Did you give him a chance?

661
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:07,053
Did you?

662
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:08,622
Answer me!

663
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,356
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

664
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,074
<i>Thanks.</i>

665
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:31,925
See you.

666
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,670
<i>Freeze!</i>

667
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:56,918
<i>We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

668
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,169
No. My God.

669
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,091
No.
My God. No!

670
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,482
Good evening General.

671
00:49:58,052 --> 00:49:58,995
Good to see you.

672
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,041
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.

673
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:07,248
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

674
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,933
He's clear, let's go!
I assume you're confident about this test?

675
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:13,749
Absolutely.

676
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:15,425
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

677
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,620
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

678
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,807
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

679
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,470
<i>Preflight complete.</i>

680
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,756
Mark.

681
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,188
<i>We are picking up an
unidentified object, closing fast.</i>

682
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,324
What the hell is that?

683
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,477
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

684
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,349
Oh my God!

685
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:50,911
Say chess.

686
00:50:50,935 --> 00:50:52,232
Chess!

687
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,451
Peter!

688
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,333
Darling.

689
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:59,472
I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

690
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,295
Pete?

691
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,727
Good news. My father got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

692
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,478
That's great.
You made it.

693
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,337
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

694
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,696
Congratulations.
Thanks, Dad.

695
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,312
Peter, the science award.

696
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:18,551
That's terrific.

697
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,187
Yeah.

698
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,248
I know this has been
a difficult time for you

699
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,623
but I want you to try to enjoy this day.

700
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,951
Commencement.

701
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,911
The end of one thing.

702
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:35,076
The start of something new.

703
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,917
I don't want to be with you anymore.

704
00:51:38,941 --> 00:51:40,675
Here's your ring.

705
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,432
You know what? Whatever.

706
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,455
Your loss.

707
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,051
You're like a brother to Harry.

708
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,682
That makes you family.

709
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,305
And if you ever need anything just...

710
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,427
give me a call.

711
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:07,440
Can I...

712
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,377
Can I fix you something?

713
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,432
No, thanks.

714
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,290
I missed him a lot today.

715
00:53:01,475 --> 00:53:02,275
I know.

716
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:05,916
I miss him too.

717
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,103
But he was there.

718
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,348
I can't help thinking about...

719
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:19,248
the last thing I said to him.

720
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:21,436
He tried to tell me something
important,

721
00:53:21,943 --> 00:53:23,732
and I threw it in his face.

722
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,466
You loved him

723
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,296
and he loved you.

724
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,554
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

725
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,070
How you were meant for great things.

726
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,303
You won't disappoint him.

727
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,868
<i>With great power...</i>

728
00:54:18,529 --> 00:54:20,505
<i>comes great responsibility.</i>

729
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,205
<i>Remember that, Pete.</i>

730
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:23,802
<i>Remember that.</i>

731
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,262
Hurry up!

732
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:48,949
This is not a man.

733
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:51,547
My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.

734
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,069
I think he's human,

735
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:55,070
I think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

736
00:54:58,993 --> 00:54:59,826
Bobby.

737
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,202
Get a load of this!

738
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:06,974
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out,

739
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,321
and he climbs up
the ropes like a spider web.

740
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,463
I see the web and it's his signature,

741
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:13,827
and I know Spider-Man was here.

742
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,300
The guy protects us, you know?

743
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:16,479
He protects the people.

744
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,399
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wackadoo.

745
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,567
He stinks and I don't like him.

746
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,389
Don't move, lady!

747
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:33,109
Guy with eight hands.

748
00:55:33,638 --> 00:55:34,747
Sounds hot.

749
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:36,942
He has those tights
and that tight little...

750
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,615
<i>♪ Dresses like a spider, ♪</i>

751
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,302
<i>♪ he looks like a bug ♪</i>

752
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,326
<i>♪ But we should all
just give him one big hug ♪</i>

753
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,498
<i>♪ Look out! ♪</i>

754
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:49,359
<i>♪ Here comes the Spider-Man ♪</i>

755
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,589
Who is Spider-Man?

756
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:56,311
He's a criminal, that's who he is!

757
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:57,801
A vigilante.

758
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:58,969
A public menace.

759
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,727
What's he doing on my front page?

760
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:03,202
Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.
She needs to know if you...

761
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,644
Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.

762
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,344
We have a page one problem. Shut up.

763
00:56:06,475 --> 00:56:08,017
Well?
He's news.

764
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,089
They're really important clients.
They can't wait. They're about to.

765
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,525
He pulled six people off that subway car.

766
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:15,204
Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.

767
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,182
Something goes wrong
and this creepy crawler is there.

768
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,542
Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!
What's that tell ya?

769
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,462
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

770
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,772
He's a hero!

771
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,953
Then why does he wear a mask?

772
00:56:25,731 --> 00:56:26,741
What's he got to hide?

773
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,761
She just needs to know if you want
the chintz or the chenille in the dining room.

774
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:30,834
Whichever one's cheaper.

775
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:32,489
Mr. Jameson, it's like this.

776
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,106
We double-booked page six.

777
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,476
See, so both Macy's and Conway's
both have three quarters...

778
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:38,466
We sold out four printings.

779
00:56:39,337 --> 00:56:40,080
Sold out?

780
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,355
Every copy.

781
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:44,441
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,
page one with a decent picture this time.

782
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:46,208
Move Conway to page 7.
There's a problem with page 7...

783
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:48,786
And make it page eight, get him
10 percent off. Make it five percent.

784
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,239
That can't be done.
Get outta here!

785
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,751
The problem is,
we don't have a decent picture.

786
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,630
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
we can barely get a glimpse of him.

787
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,192
What is he, shy?

788
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,582
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong,
we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.

789
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:03,241
Put an ad on the front page.

790
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:05,090
Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.

791
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,037
He doesn't wanna be famous?

792
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,217
I'll make him infamous!

793
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,160
Hey!

794
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,652
Buzz off.

795
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,346
MJ, it's me, Peter.

796
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,245
Hi!

797
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:27,074
Hey.

798
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,655
What are you doing around here?

799
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,143
I'm begging for a job.
How about you?

800
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,315
I'm headed to an audition.

801
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:36,274
An audition?

802
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:37,775
So you're acting now?

803
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:38,728
Yeah.

804
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:40,278
I work steady.

805
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,875
In fact, I just got off a job.

806
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:44,304
That's great, MJ!

807
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:45,825
You're doing it!

808
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:47,638
You're living your dream!
Hey, glamour girl!

809
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:49,799
Yeah.
Your drawer was short $6!

810
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,122
Next time that happens,

811
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,593
I'mma take it out of your check.

812
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,168
Excuse me, Miss Watson?

813
00:57:55,419 --> 00:57:56,586
I'm talking to you!

814
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,387
Hey!

815
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,903
Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.

816
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:01,591
Well, it better not happen
no more, you hear me?

817
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,223
Don't roll your eyes at me.

818
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,247
Some dream?

819
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,699
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

820
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,690
Don't tell Harry.

821
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:18,902
Don't tell Harry?

822
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,361
Aren't you guys living together?

823
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,254
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

824
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:25,879
Yeah. Right.

825
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,755
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

826
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,538
He'd think it was low or something.

827
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,872
It's not low.

828
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,343
You have a job.

829
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:35,849
You know Harry...

830
00:58:36,732 --> 00:58:39,015
doesn't live on a little place
I like to call Earth.

831
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,357
No, I guess not.

832
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,629
Thanks, Pete.

833
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,847
We should catch up sometime.

834
00:58:56,473 --> 00:58:58,082
Let's get some lunch some evening.

835
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,526
Well I...

836
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:04,760
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

837
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,364
And I won't tell Harry.

838
00:59:06,388 --> 00:59:07,793
No, don't tell Harry.

839
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:08,659
I won't!

840
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,754
I won't tell Harry.

841
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,248
Timing's perfect. Hey.

842
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,386
Five new contracts.

843
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,506
It'll be great.

844
00:59:32,754 --> 00:59:35,261
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

845
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,917
Spent half of it on the phone.

846
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:41,316
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help.

847
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,724
I'm really lost here.

848
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:45,560
Are you alright?

849
00:59:47,224 --> 00:59:48,406
You look like you just got,

850
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,271
second place in the science fair.

851
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:51,552
No I...

852
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:55,800
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

853
00:59:55,897 --> 00:59:56,958
You were late again?

854
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't get it.

855
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:01,224
Wait, where do you go all the time?

856
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,137
Around.

857
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:04,778
Peter Parker.

858
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,508
Maybe you'll tell me who she is.

859
01:00:07,744 --> 01:00:08,483
Who's that?

860
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:10,606
This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
Dad.

861
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,567
When do I get to meet her?
Dad.

862
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:15,866
Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.

863
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,814
Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...

864
01:00:22,023 --> 01:00:23,212
a job now, right?

865
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,940
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

866
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,530
No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
It's no problem.

867
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:30,811
I'll make a few calls.

868
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,367
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.

869
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:35,131
I like to earn what I get.
I can find my own work.

870
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,270
I respect that.

871
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,762
You want to make
it on your own steam.

872
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,582
That's great.

873
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,512
What other skills do you have, Parker?

874
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,640
I was thinking of something in photography.

875
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,285
Hello.

876
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:54,389
Let's go!

877
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:55,556
Move it!

878
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,025
Watch the street!

879
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:14,913
Cheese!

880
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,390
They're crap.

881
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:26,504
Crap.

882
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:28,562
Crap. Megacrap.

883
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,591
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

884
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,256
That seems a little low.

885
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,686
Take them somewhere else, then.

886
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,037
<i>Sir, your wife says the tile you
ordered for the foyer is out of stock.</i>

887
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:38,834
Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

888
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:39,892
Sit down.

889
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:40,733
Give me that.

890
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,688
Give you 300.

891
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:45,159
That's the standard freelance fee.

892
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,275
Tear up page one.
Run that photo instead.

893
01:01:47,299 --> 01:01:48,059
Headline?

894
01:01:48,097 --> 01:01:49,986
Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?

895
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,391
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.

896
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,238
Menace?

897
01:01:52,262 --> 01:01:54,603
He was protecting that armoured...
Tell you what, Atticus.

898
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,242
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Ok?

899
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:57,440
Alright? That ok with you?

900
01:01:57,584 --> 01:01:58,995
Yes, sir.
Goody.

901
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,247
Give this to the girl up front.

902
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:02,630
She'll see you get paid.

903
01:02:03,665 --> 01:02:04,792
I'd like a job, sir.

904
01:02:04,816 --> 01:02:06,544
No jobs. Freelance.

905
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,489
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

906
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,470
You bring me some more shots
of that newspaper-selling clown,

907
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:12,876
maybe I'll take them off your hands.

908
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,552
But I never said you have a job.

909
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:16,009
Meat.

910
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,889
I'll send you a nice box
of Christmas meat,

911
01:02:17,913 --> 01:02:19,182
best I can do. Get outta here.

912
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:20,694
Bring me more photos.

913
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,625
Hi.
Hi.

914
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,109
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

915
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,734
Welcome to the Daily Bugle.

916
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:30,874
Thank you.

917
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,249
I'm Peter Parker.

918
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,046
I'm a photographer.

919
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,577
Yes.

920
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:41,017
I can see that.

921
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,602
As of today,

922
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,423
OSCORP lndustries,

923
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:55,111
has surpassed Quest Aerospace

924
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,509
as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

925
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,071
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

926
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,143
costs are down,

927
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,845
revenues are up,

928
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,271
and our stock,

929
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:08,859
has never been higher.

930
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,608
Wonderful news Norman.

931
01:03:10,632 --> 01:03:11,442
Wonderful.

932
01:03:11,813 --> 01:03:13,664
In fact, it's the reason
for selling the company.

933
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,414
What?

934
01:03:15,536 --> 01:03:18,658
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing.

935
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,224
Expanding.

936
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,716
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

937
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,426
Why wasn't I told?

938
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:28,042
Last thing they want
is a power struggle,

939
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:29,834
with entrenched management.

940
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:32,139
The deal is off if you come with it.

941
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,319
The board expects
your resignation in 30 days.

942
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:38,099
You can't do this to me.

943
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:42,967
I started this company.

944
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,732
You know how much I sacrificed?

945
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,600
Max.

946
01:03:51,923 --> 01:03:53,251
Please.
Norman,

947
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:55,696
the board is unanimous.

948
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,055
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

949
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,008
I'm sorry.

950
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,860
You're out, Norman.

951
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,601
Am I?

952
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,234
<i>Welcome to OSCORP lndustries
Unity Day Festival!</i>

953
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,941
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

954
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,889
MJ,

955
01:05:06,118 --> 01:05:07,653
why didn't you wear the black dress?

956
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,770
Just, I wanted to impress my father.

957
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,366
He loves black.

958
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,899
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what.

959
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:17,154
You think I'm pretty.

960
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,030
I think you're beautiful.

961
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,001
MJ, would you do me a favor?

962
01:05:34,025 --> 01:05:36,267
I... forgot my drink inside.
Come on.

963
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,640
Hi, Mr. Fargas.

964
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:48,596
Harry.

965
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,060
Have you seen my father around?

966
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:54,830
Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

967
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,702
What is that?

968
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:09,438
Must be new this year.

969
01:06:14,468 --> 01:06:15,304
What is that?

970
01:06:15,549 --> 01:06:16,632
That's our glider!

971
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:29,346
What the hell was that?

972
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,098
Code three! Code three!

973
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,499
Oh my God! Harry!
MJ!

974
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,724
Harry! Help me! Harry!

975
01:07:32,268 --> 01:07:34,019
Out, am I?

976
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,002
Mary Jane!

977
01:07:40,026 --> 01:07:41,003
Harry!

978
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,925
Hello, my dear.

979
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,258
It's Spider-Man!

980
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,440
Come on, move, kid.

981
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:02,369
Billy!

982
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,800
Somebody help him!

983
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,668
No!

984
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:12,393
Mommy!

985
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,122
Hold it right there!

986
01:08:16,146 --> 01:08:17,375
I surrender.

987
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:18,332
Boy.

988
01:08:18,357 --> 01:08:19,270
Hold it right there!

989
01:08:26,226 --> 01:08:27,227
Impressive.

990
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,467
Mary Jane!

991
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:53,617
Help!

992
01:08:53,641 --> 01:08:55,080
Someone please help me!

993
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:20,867
Hold on!

994
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:23,578
Watch out!

995
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,617
We'll meet again,

996
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:36,512
Spider-Man!

997
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,536
Hold on, Mary Jane!

998
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:22,998
Well,

999
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:24,577
beats taking the subway.

1000
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,483
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

1001
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:29,186
Wait.

1002
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:30,874
Who are you?

1003
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,716
You know who I am.

1004
01:10:32,888 --> 01:10:33,842
I do?

1005
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,849
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1006
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,400
Incredible?

1007
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,891
What do you mean he's incredible?

1008
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:55,155
No. Alright, wait.

1009
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:56,571
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

1010
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,093
No, I'm gonna come o...

1011
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,953
Alright. Fine.

1012
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,961
Fine, will you call me in the morning,
and, and...

1013
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,125
we'll go and have breakfast and...

1014
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:07,891
I wanna buy you something.

1015
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,253
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

1016
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:13,966
Ok.

1017
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:15,342
And...

1018
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:17,252
what do you mean, incredible?

1019
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:20,973
Alright. I'm sorry.

1020
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:21,736
Sleep tight.

1021
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,832
Don't let the bedbugs...

1022
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,233
She's alright.
She's...

1023
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:32,778
just a little rattled.

1024
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:37,238
Look Pete, I should have
told you about us.

1025
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,495
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

1026
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,289
It's just you know,
you never made a move.

1027
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,468
You're right.

1028
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,039
I didn't.

1029
01:11:54,497 --> 01:11:56,195
I'm gonna get some rest.

1030
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,945
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

1031
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,789
What was that thing?

1032
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:04,858
I don't know.

1033
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,819
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

1034
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,089
Somebody there?

1035
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,479
<i>Somebody?</i>

1036
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,268
Who said that?

1037
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,119
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

1038
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,275
<i>You've known all along.</i>

1039
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,035
Where are you?

1040
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,121
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

1041
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,386
<i>I'm right here.</i>

1042
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,151
I don't understand.

1043
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,933
Did you think it was coincidence?

1044
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,113
So many good things,
all happening for you.

1045
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:13,711
All for you,

1046
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,386
Norman.

1047
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,308
What do you want?

1048
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,183
To say what you won't.

1049
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,709
To do what you can't.

1050
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,724
To remove...

1051
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:29,084
those in your way.

1052
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,067
The board members.

1053
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:38,461
You killed them.

1054
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,063
We killed them.

1055
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,430
We?

1056
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:42,832
Remember?

1057
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:46,171
Your little accident in the laboratory.

1058
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
The performance enhancers.

1059
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,873
Bingo.

1060
01:13:50,897 --> 01:13:51,707
Me!

1061
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:54,580
Your greatest creation.

1062
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:58,805
Bringing you what you've always wanted.

1063
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,477
Power, beyond your wildest dreams.

1064
01:14:02,502 --> 01:14:04,446
And it's only the beginning.

1065
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,056
There's only one...

1066
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:10,455
who can stop us.

1067
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,557
Or imagine if he joined us.

1068
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:20,986
Spider-Man.

1069
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,041
And the Green Goblin.

1070
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,698
The Green Goblin. You like that?

1071
01:14:24,722 --> 01:14:26,162
Made it up myself.
Mr. Jameson.

1072
01:14:26,477 --> 01:14:28,326
These weirdos all gotta have a name now.

1073
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,701
Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...

1074
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:30,630
Hoffman!
Yeah?

1075
01:14:32,822 --> 01:14:34,792
Call the patent office,
copyright the name Green Goblin,

1076
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:36,533
I want a quarter every
time somebody says it.

1077
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,025
How about Green Meanie?

1078
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:40,798
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.

1079
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:42,203
He was trying to save it. That's slander.

1080
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,080
It is not. I resent that.

1081
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,803
Slander is spoken.

1082
01:14:45,975 --> 01:14:47,108
In print, it's libel.

1083
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,631
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.

1084
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,061
I trust my barber.

1085
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,106
What are you, his lawyer?
Get outta here.

1086
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,283
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

1087
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,691
That's what made this country...

1088
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,449
Jameson,

1089
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:09,030
you slime.

1090
01:15:09,544 --> 01:15:13,121
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

1091
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,359
I don't know who he is.
His stuff comes in the mail.

1092
01:15:15,384 --> 01:15:17,179
You're lying!
I swear.

1093
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,648
He's the one who can bring me to him.

1094
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:20,921
I don't know who he is.

1095
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:22,579
You are useless.

1096
01:15:22,604 --> 01:15:24,329
Set him down tough guy.

1097
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,572
Speak of the devil!

1098
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:28,887
Spider-Man, I knew you two
were in this together!

1099
01:15:28,911 --> 01:15:29,548
I...

1100
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:32,556
Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

1101
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:35,041
Sleep...

1102
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,410
<i>Wake up little spider.</i>

1103
01:15:52,154 --> 01:15:53,060
<i>Wake up.</i>

1104
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:54,788
<i>No,</i>

1105
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,707
<i>you're not dead...</i>

1106
01:15:57,043 --> 01:15:57,988
<i>yet.</i>

1107
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,441
<i>Just paralyzed...</i>

1108
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,191
<i>temporarily.</i>

1109
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,518
You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.

1110
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:09,816
You and I are not so different.

1111
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:11,513
I'm not like you.

1112
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:13,706
You're a murderer.

1113
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,641
Well,

1114
01:16:15,323 --> 01:16:16,526
to each his own.

1115
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,562
I chose my path,

1116
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:20,156
you chose the way of the hero.

1117
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,066
And they found you amusing
for a while,

1118
01:16:23,398 --> 01:16:24,976
the people of this city.

1119
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,490
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

1120
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,699
is to see a hero fail,

1121
01:16:30,723 --> 01:16:31,533
fall,

1122
01:16:31,557 --> 01:16:32,545
die trying.

1123
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:35,412
In spite of everything you've done for
them,

1124
01:16:35,436 --> 01:16:37,079
eventually, they will hate you.

1125
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:38,385
Why bother?

1126
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,626
Because it's right.

1127
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:42,789
Here's the real truth.

1128
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,476
There are eight million people in this city.

1129
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:51,356
And those teeming masses
exist for the sole purpose

1130
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:55,527
of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

1131
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:56,960
You, me,

1132
01:16:57,587 --> 01:16:58,986
we're exceptional.

1133
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,536
I could squash you
like a bug right now.

1134
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,652
But I'm offering you a choice.

1135
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:08,556
Join me.

1136
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,971
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

1137
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,479
What we could create.

1138
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,347
Or we could destroy.

1139
01:17:18,004 --> 01:17:21,312
Because the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish

1140
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:24,175
battle again and again and
again until we're both dead.

1141
01:17:24,748 --> 01:17:26,560
Is that what you want?

1142
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:30,834
Think about it, hero.

1143
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,358
<i>In spite of everything
you've done for them,</i>

1144
01:17:46,382 --> 01:17:48,420
<i>eventually they will hate you.</i>

1145
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,013
Hey!

1146
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,330
It's me again.

1147
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:01,120
Hey!

1148
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,464
How was your audition?

1149
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:03,959
How'd you know?

1150
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:05,526
The hot line. Your mom

1151
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,635
told my aunt, told me.

1152
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,936
So you just came by?

1153
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,508
I was in the neighborhood.

1154
01:18:11,532 --> 01:18:13,217
Needed to see a friendly face.

1155
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,567
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

1156
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,762
So how'd it go?

1157
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,487
They said I needed acting lessons.

1158
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,288
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

1159
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,569
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.

1160
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,113
The sky's the limit, up to $7

1161
01:18:33,668 --> 01:18:34,907
84 cents.

1162
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,288
I'd like a cheeseburger.

1163
01:18:38,577 --> 01:18:40,662
But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.

1164
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,061
Come with us.

1165
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,666
No, thanks.

1166
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:46,635
How's it going with...

1167
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,240
Never mind.

1168
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:50,837
That's none of my business.

1169
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,341
It's not?

1170
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,532
Why so interested?

1171
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:57,524
I'm not.

1172
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,290
You're not?

1173
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,893
Well, why would I be?

1174
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:03,993
I don't know.

1175
01:19:04,337 --> 01:19:05,594
Why would you be?

1176
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,162
I, that's a...

1177
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:11,592
I don't know.

1178
01:19:14,592 --> 01:19:16,037
Sorry you won't come with us.

1179
01:19:19,778 --> 01:19:21,037
I better run, tiger.

1180
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,220
Hey, check it out, man.

1181
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,236
Come on, man.

1182
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,634
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

1183
01:19:58,695 --> 01:19:59,734
Get off me!

1184
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:34,180
Wait!

1185
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,958
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

1186
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,411
You have a knack for saving my life.

1187
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:46,950
I think I have a superhero stalker.

1188
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,730
I was in the neighborhood.

1189
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:51,626
You are...

1190
01:20:52,087 --> 01:20:53,054
amazing.

1191
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,827
Some people don't think so.

1192
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,134
But you are.

1193
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:01,189
Nice to have a fan.

1194
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,908
Do I get to say thank you this time?

1195
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:06,783
Wait.

1196
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,171
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!

1197
01:22:18,196 --> 01:22:19,506
My baby's in there! Let me go!

1198
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:21,130
I can't let you in there,
the roof's about to collapse!

1199
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:22,801
Please save my baby!
I can't let you in there,

1200
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:24,530
Somebody save my baby!
The roof's about to collapse!

1201
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,149
Look! Up there!

1202
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,616
Save my baby, please!

1203
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,246
No!

1204
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,555
It's ok. Your baby's fine.

1205
01:23:09,034 --> 01:23:10,245
My baby!

1206
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,852
God bless you, Spider-Man.

1207
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,276
Bless you.

1208
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,116
There he's! Don't let him get away!

1209
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,732
Hold it! Hold it right there!

1210
01:23:19,011 --> 01:23:20,644
You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

1211
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:22,840
My God, there's
somebody still up there!

1212
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,250
I'm going.

1213
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,118
I'll be here when you get back.

1214
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:31,589
Not coming back, chief.

1215
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,132
Go! Go!

1216
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,090
Where are you?

1217
01:23:45,777 --> 01:23:47,082
Where are you?

1218
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,067
I'm gonna get you out of here!

1219
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:58,637
It's ok.

1220
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,487
You're pathetically predictable.

1221
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:10,730
Like a moth to the flame.

1222
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:14,298
What about my generous proposal?

1223
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,498
Are you in

1224
01:24:16,522 --> 01:24:17,831
or are you out?

1225
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:19,959
It's you who's out, Gobby.

1226
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:21,240
Out of your mind.

1227
01:24:21,468 --> 01:24:22,772
Wrong answer.

1228
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:25,531
Great.

1229
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,091
No one says no to me!

1230
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,975
MJ, will you stop goofing around?

1231
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:18,446
Harry, relax.

1232
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:22,200
He's here.

1233
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:23,940
Are you ready?

1234
01:25:24,344 --> 01:25:25,118
Yeah.

1235
01:25:26,064 --> 01:25:27,402
Aunt May.

1236
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:28,841
I'm sorry I'm late.

1237
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,321
Work was murder.

1238
01:25:30,993 --> 01:25:32,478
I picked up a fruitcake.

1239
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:33,677
Why thank you Mr. Osborn.

1240
01:25:33,702 --> 01:25:34,982
We're so glad you could come.
You look great.

1241
01:25:35,007 --> 01:25:35,600
Thanks.

1242
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,124
Who is this lovely young lady?

1243
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,249
MJ, I'd like you to meet
my father, Norman Osborn.

1244
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:42,976
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

1245
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:44,335
Hi.
How do you do?

1246
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:46,280
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

1247
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,797
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.

1248
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:50,144
Now, where is Peter?

1249
01:25:50,523 --> 01:25:52,731
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

1250
01:25:58,408 --> 01:25:59,184
That's...

1251
01:25:59,377 --> 01:26:00,838
weird, I didn't know he was here.

1252
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:05,886
Peter?

1253
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,215
Peter?

1254
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,674
Is that you?

1255
01:26:19,729 --> 01:26:20,432
Pete?

1256
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,124
How strange.

1257
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:24,580
There's nobody here.

1258
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:33,885
Bit of a slob, isn't he?

1259
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:36,103
All brilliant men are.

1260
01:27:09,614 --> 01:27:10,630
Hey, everyone.

1261
01:27:11,341 --> 01:27:12,132
Peter!

1262
01:27:12,157 --> 01:27:14,105
Peter!
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

1263
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:16,796
Had to beat an old lady with
a stick to get these cranberries.

1264
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:19,597
Thank you.

1265
01:27:19,621 --> 01:27:21,402
Now then, everybody sit down

1266
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,224
and we can say grace.

1267
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:25,488
Parker.

1268
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,451
Here we go.

1269
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,531
There we are.

1270
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:38,120
It looks delicious.

1271
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,245
Norman.

1272
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:42,971
Will you do the honors?

1273
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,801
Why Peter,

1274
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:58,501
you're bleeding.

1275
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:02,360
Yeah.

1276
01:28:02,714 --> 01:28:04,600
I stepped off a kerb and...

1277
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:06,948
got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1278
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:08,495
Well, let me see.

1279
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,451
Oh my goodness.

1280
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,937
That looks awful.
No, it's nothing.

1281
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,819
I'll get the first-aid kit.

1282
01:28:14,913 --> 01:28:16,516
Then we'll say grace.

1283
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,324
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment

1284
01:28:19,348 --> 01:28:21,873
and we
are going to do things properly.

1285
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,836
How did you say that happened?

1286
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,394
Bike messenger.

1287
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,433
Knocked me down.

1288
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,258
If you'll excuse me I've...

1289
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:39,310
got to be going.
Wh... Why?

1290
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,262
Something...

1291
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:43,374
has come to my attention.

1292
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,702
Are you alright?

1293
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:46,601
I'm fine, just fine.

1294
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,960
Thank you, Mrs. Parker.
Everyone.

1295
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,396
Enjoy the fruitcake.

1296
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:51,398
Dad!

1297
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:53,828
Dad!

1298
01:28:54,148 --> 01:28:55,117
What are you doing?

1299
01:28:55,429 --> 01:28:57,967
I plan this whole thing so you can
meet MJ and now you have to leave?

1300
01:28:57,992 --> 01:28:58,999
I've got to go.

1301
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,532
This girl is important to me.

1302
01:29:01,556 --> 01:29:03,953
Harry, please. Look at her.

1303
01:29:04,315 --> 01:29:08,180
Do you think a woman like that's sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

1304
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,374
What are you saying?

1305
01:29:09,925 --> 01:29:11,467
Your mother was beautiful too.

1306
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:12,659
They're all beautiful.

1307
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:17,018
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

1308
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,519
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1309
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:22,189
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend.

1310
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,067
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1311
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,470
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

1312
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,238
You heard?

1313
01:29:40,955 --> 01:29:42,187
Everyone heard that creep.

1314
01:29:42,273 --> 01:29:43,991
That creep is my father.

1315
01:29:44,015 --> 01:29:46,436
Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll
become half of what he is.

1316
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,155
So just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand!

1317
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,069
Harry Osborn!

1318
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,000
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1319
01:29:56,811 --> 01:30:00,147
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

1320
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,717
<i>But Parker,</i>

1321
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:03,969
<i>we can destroy him.</i>

1322
01:30:04,256 --> 01:30:05,193
I can't.

1323
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,145
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

1324
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,350
<i>Parker...</i>

1325
01:30:09,374 --> 01:30:10,821
<i>must be educated.</i>

1326
01:30:13,629 --> 01:30:14,468
What do I do?

1327
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:18,300
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

1328
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:19,986
<i>Make him suffer.</i>

1329
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,073
<i>Make him wish he were dead.</i>

1330
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,334
Yes?

1331
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,419
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

1332
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:27,630
But how?

1333
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:32,134
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

1334
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,511
Tell me how!

1335
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,846
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

1336
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:39,141
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

1337
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,629
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

1338
01:30:44,902 --> 01:30:47,715
as we forgive those who
trespassed against us.

1339
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:51,012
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

1340
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:02,252
Deliver us!

1341
01:31:02,438 --> 01:31:03,623
Finish it!

1342
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:04,989
Finish it!

1343
01:31:05,014 --> 01:31:07,389
From evil!

1344
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:18,806
Get the BP.

1345
01:31:19,145 --> 01:31:19,962
Aunt May!

1346
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,380
Is she gonna be ok?

1347
01:31:21,404 --> 01:31:22,980
What happened? What happened?
Yes, she's going to be ok.

1348
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,315
Look, you're going to have to leave.

1349
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,218
Right now.
What happened?

1350
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:26,507
Those eyes!

1351
01:31:26,587 --> 01:31:29,050
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1352
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,682
He knows who I am.

1353
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:22,828
I'm sorry.

1354
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,304
Will she be ok?

1355
01:32:28,329 --> 01:32:29,671
She's gonna be fine.

1356
01:32:29,696 --> 01:32:31,351
She's been sleeping all day.

1357
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:34,495
Thanks for coming.

1358
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,118
Of course.

1359
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:41,252
How are you?

1360
01:32:41,641 --> 01:32:43,382
You ok about the other night?

1361
01:32:43,407 --> 01:32:44,380
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1362
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,076
I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1363
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:48,467
Have you talked to Harry?

1364
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,726
He called me.

1365
01:32:50,961 --> 01:32:52,316
I haven't called him back.

1366
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,155
The fact is...

1367
01:32:58,296 --> 01:32:59,729
I'm in love with somebody else.

1368
01:33:00,046 --> 01:33:00,741
You are?

1369
01:33:00,846 --> 01:33:02,139
At least, I think I am.

1370
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,803
It's not the right time to talk about it.
No, no.

1371
01:33:06,828 --> 01:33:07,691
Go on.

1372
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,225
Would I know his name, this guy?

1373
01:33:11,764 --> 01:33:13,818
You'll think I'm a stupid
little girl with a crush.

1374
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,529
Trust me.

1375
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,209
It's funny.

1376
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:21,250
He's saved my life twice,

1377
01:33:21,274 --> 01:33:23,009
and I've never even seen his face.

1378
01:33:24,236 --> 01:33:24,962
Him.

1379
01:33:25,783 --> 01:33:26,892
You're laughing at me.
No. No.

1380
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:28,257
No, I understand.

1381
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:30,204
He is extremely cool.

1382
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:33,150
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

1383
01:33:33,175 --> 01:33:34,138
No, no.

1384
01:33:34,162 --> 01:33:37,095
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1385
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,086
I know him a little bit.

1386
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:42,094
I'm sort of his
unofficial photographer.

1387
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,357
Has he mentioned me?

1388
01:33:45,143 --> 01:33:45,896
Yeah.

1389
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,327
What'd he say?

1390
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,319
I said...

1391
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,238
He asked me...

1392
01:33:53,287 --> 01:33:54,615
what I thought about you.

1393
01:33:56,248 --> 01:33:57,396
And what did you say?

1394
01:33:58,675 --> 01:33:59,664
I said...

1395
01:34:02,131 --> 01:34:04,126
Spider-Man. I said...

1396
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,514
The great thing about MJ...

1397
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,202
Is...

1398
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,509
When you...

1399
01:34:12,017 --> 01:34:13,301
look in her eyes,

1400
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,371
and she's looking back in yours,

1401
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:21,811
everything...

1402
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,240
feels...

1403
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,201
Not quite normal.

1404
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,172
Because you feel...

1405
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,422
stronger...

1406
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,490
and weaker...

1407
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:36,531
at the same time.

1408
01:34:38,154 --> 01:34:39,586
You feel excited...

1409
01:34:41,251 --> 01:34:42,656
and at the same time...

1410
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:44,913
Terrified.

1411
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,338
The truth is you...

1412
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:51,889
you don't know what you feel,

1413
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,077
except you know what
kind of man you want to be.

1414
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,249
It's as if you've...

1415
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:03,060
reached...

1416
01:35:03,678 --> 01:35:05,092
the unreachable...

1417
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:08,701
and you weren't ready for it.

1418
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:14,420
You said that?

1419
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,663
Well, something like that.

1420
01:35:48,294 --> 01:35:49,128
Hey.

1421
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,424
Dad?

1422
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,720
Dad, is that you?

1423
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,878
What is it?

1424
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,265
Well, you were right about MJ.

1425
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:25,622
You're right about everything.

1426
01:36:27,839 --> 01:36:29,216
She's in love with Peter.

1427
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:31,607
Parker?

1428
01:36:32,123 --> 01:36:32,564
Yeah.

1429
01:36:32,834 --> 01:36:34,467
And how does he feel about her?

1430
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,411
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1431
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,368
He pretends like he doesn't, but...

1432
01:36:42,766 --> 01:36:44,609
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1433
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:49,977
I'm so sorry.

1434
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:55,285
I haven't always been there for you, have I?

1435
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,678
You're busy. 
You're an important man. I...

1436
01:37:00,702 --> 01:37:01,523
I understand.

1437
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,172
That's no excuse.

1438
01:37:04,448 --> 01:37:05,820
I'm proud of you.

1439
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:10,373
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.

1440
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,303
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1441
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:30,982
Wake up, little spider.

1442
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,232
Wake up.

1443
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,474
Go home, dear.

1444
01:37:35,806 --> 01:37:37,140
You look awful.

1445
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,728
And you look beautiful.
Well, thank you.

1446
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:41,313
I don't like to leave you here.

1447
01:37:41,338 --> 01:37:42,813
But I'm safe here.

1448
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:44,763
Can I do anything for you?

1449
01:37:44,787 --> 01:37:46,109
You do too much.

1450
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,433
College, a job,

1451
01:37:47,648 --> 01:37:50,485
all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1452
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,298
A smile. Finally.

1453
01:37:54,353 --> 01:37:57,696
Haven't seen one of those on your
face since Mary Jane was here.

1454
01:37:57,765 --> 01:37:58,402
Hey.

1455
01:37:58,816 --> 01:38:00,827
You were supposed to be asleep.

1456
01:38:01,983 --> 01:38:06,334
You know, you were about 6 years old
when MJ's family moved in next door.

1457
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,662
And when she got out of the car,

1458
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:11,051
and you saw her for the first time,

1459
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,834
you grabbed me and said,
Aunt May,

1460
01:38:13,858 --> 01:38:15,044
Aunt May,

1461
01:38:15,714 --> 01:38:17,370
is that an angel?

1462
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:18,964
Gee, did I say that?

1463
01:38:19,409 --> 01:38:20,839
You sure did.

1464
01:38:23,943 --> 01:38:24,397
Well,

1465
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,214
Harry's in love with her.

1466
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,349
She's still his girl.

1467
01:38:28,856 --> 01:38:30,466
Well, isn't that up to her?

1468
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,811
She doesn't really know who I am.

1469
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,122
Because you won't let her.

1470
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:38,130
You're so mysterious all the time.

1471
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:39,818
Tell me,

1472
01:38:40,286 --> 01:38:41,980
would it be so dangerous

1473
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:45,271
to let Mary Jane know 
how much you care?

1474
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,922
Everybody else knows.

1475
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,218
I'll be right back.

1476
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:54,770
But...

1477
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,958
Come on, pick up.

1478
01:39:04,572 --> 01:39:05,572
<i>Hi...</i>
Hey MJ!

1479
01:39:05,597 --> 01:39:06,947
Sing your song at the beep.

1480
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:10,471
MJ, it's Peter. You there?

1481
01:39:11,213 --> 01:39:11,934
Hello?

1482
01:39:12,471 --> 01:39:13,338
You there?

1483
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,583
Well, I'm just calling
to check up on you.

1484
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:18,353
Will you call me when you get in, ok?

1485
01:39:19,252 --> 01:39:20,228
Alright, well...

1486
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:21,774
Don't...

1487
01:39:22,947 --> 01:39:24,485
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1488
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,032
Hello?

1489
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:32,381
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1490
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:34,504
Where is she?

1491
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:23,106
What is that?
That's cool!

1492
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,632
<i>♪ The itsy-bitsy spider ♪</i>

1493

Goblin, what have you done?

1497
01:41:32,975 --> 01:41:34,034
Spider-Man!

1498
01:41:34,261 --> 01:41:37,105
This is why only fools are heroes.

1499
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,135
Because you never know,

1500
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:43,315
when some lunatic will come
along with a sadistic choice.

1501
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,588
Let die the woman you love?

1502
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,053
Or...

1503
01:41:54,232 --> 01:41:56,814
Suffer the little children.

1504
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,227
Spider-Man!

1505
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:01,498
Save us!

1506
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,030
Save us!

1507
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,621
Make your choice, Spider-Man.

1508
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,091
And see how a hero is rewarded.

1509
01:42:11,304 --> 01:42:12,560
Don't do it, Goblin!

1510
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,023
We are who we choose to be.

1511
01:42:16,564 --> 01:42:17,899
Now, choose!

1512
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:18,978
No!

1513
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:49,610
Everybody stay still!

1514
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,508
Ahoy up there!

1515
01:43:00,912 --> 01:43:03,830
We're gonna bring
the barge right under you.

1516
01:43:11,487 --> 01:43:12,424
He's coming back!

1517
01:43:12,862 --> 01:43:13,550
Listen.

1518
01:43:14,049 --> 01:43:15,397
I need you to climb down.

1519
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:16,261
I can't.

1520
01:43:16,285 --> 01:43:17,236
Yes, you can!

1521
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,685
MJ, you can do it.

1522
01:43:23,888 --> 01:43:24,841
You have to!

1523
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:26,177
Trust me.

1524
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:29,566
Hold on tight

1525
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,155
and go quickly.

1526
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:37,366
Hurry!

1527
01:43:37,884 --> 01:43:38,979
I can't. I can't do it!

1528
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:40,377
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1529
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,141
He's not gonna make it.
He's gonna make it!

1530
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:23,366
It's time to die.

1531
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,542
Come on up here, tough guy!
I got a little something for ya!

1532
01:44:34,567 --> 01:44:35,814
We ought to kick your freaking ass!

1533
01:44:35,839 --> 01:44:37,050
Leave Spider-Man alone!

1534
01:44:37,074 --> 01:44:39,216
You gonna pick on a guy trying 
to save a bunch of kids?

1535
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,560
Yeah, I got something for your ass!

1536
01:44:41,585 --> 01:44:43,461
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1537
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,946
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1538
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:00,993
Spider-Man, watch out!

1539
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:35,531
Misery, misery, misery.

1540
01:45:35,556 --> 01:45:37,164
That's what you've chosen.

1541
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:40,179
I offered you friendship,

1542
01:45:41,066 --> 01:45:42,942
and you spat in my face.

1543
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,263
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1544
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,620
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death

1545
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,188
would have been quick and painless.

1546
01:46:43,213 --> 01:46:46,230
But now that 
you've really pissed me off,

1547
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:48,723
I'm gonna finish her,

1548
01:46:49,176 --> 01:46:52,046
nice and slow.

1549
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,029
MJ and I...

1550
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,428
We're gonna have a hell of a time.

1551
01:47:56,341 --> 01:47:57,631
Peter, stop!

1552
01:47:58,139 --> 01:47:58,877
Stop!

1553
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,279
It's me.

1554
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:10,739
Mr. Osborn.

1555
01:48:11,091 --> 01:48:12,513
Peter, thank God for you.

1556
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:15,280
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1557
01:48:15,372 --> 01:48:17,755
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1558
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:20,239
Don't, don't let him take me again.

1559
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,662
I beg you. Protect me.

1560
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,972
You tried to kill Aunt May.

1561
01:48:24,997 --> 01:48:26,374
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1562
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:27,631
But not you.

1563
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:30,283
I tried to stop it,

1564
01:48:30,748 --> 01:48:32,522
but I couldn't stop it.

1565
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:34,412
I would never hurt you.

1566
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,654
I knew from the beginning...

1567
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,568
If anything ever happened to me...

1568
01:48:39,938 --> 01:48:42,248
It was you that I could count on.

1569
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:46,102
You, Peter Parker,
would save me and so you have.

1570
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:47,934
Thank God for you.

1571
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,700
Give me your hand.

1572
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:53,181
Believe in me...

1573
01:48:53,564 --> 01:48:55,187
as I believed in you.

1574
01:48:56,649 --> 01:48:58,491
I've been like a father to you.

1575
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,952
Be a son to me now.

1576
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,068
I have a father.

1577
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,334
His name was Ben Parker.

1578
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,754
Godspeed Spider-Man.
What?

1579
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:33,064
Peter...

1580
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,278
Don't tell Harry.

1581
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,625
What have you done?

1582
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:12,574
What have you done?

1583
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,080
Hey.

1584
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,462
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1585
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:46,048
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1586
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:50,590
I didn't lose him.

1587
01:50:50,614 --> 01:50:52,103
He was stolen from me.

1588
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:55,923
One day, Spider-Man will pay.

1589
01:50:58,444 --> 01:51:00,852
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1590
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,126
Thank God for you, Peter.

1591
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:10,642
You're the only family I have.

1592
01:51:35,996 --> 01:51:37,493
<font color="#80ffff"><i>No matter what I do,</i></font>

1593
01:51:38,434 --> 01:51:40,351
<font color="#80ffff"><i>no matter how hard I try,</i></font>

1594
01:51:42,169 --> 01:51:43,517
<font color="#80ffff"><i>the ones I love</i></font>

1595
01:51:44,203 --> 01:51:46,172
<font color="#80ffff"><i>will always be the ones who pay.</i></font>

1596
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,726
You must miss him so much.

1597
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,163
It's been so hard without him.

1598
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:08,148
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1599
01:52:10,695 --> 01:52:12,024
When I was up there,

1600
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,900
and I thought I was gonna die...

1601
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,173
There was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1602
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:25,134
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1603
01:52:27,477 --> 01:52:28,852
It was you Pete.

1604
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,094
I kept thinking,

1605
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,329
I hope I make it through this,

1606
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:40,510
so I could see Peter Parker's
face one more time.

1607
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,041
Really?

1608
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,539
There's only one man,

1609
01:52:47,531 --> 01:52:49,640
who's always been there for me...

1610
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:53,539
Who makes me feel...

1611
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:56,936
like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1612
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,507
That I'm just...

1613
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:03,611
Me.

1614
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:06,338
And that's ok.

1615
01:53:09,121 --> 01:53:10,111
The truth is,

1616
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:13,892
I love you.

1617
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:18,431
I love you so much, Peter.

1618
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,676
<font color="#80ffff"><i>All I wanted,</i></font>

1619
01:53:40,964 --> 01:53:43,253
<font color="#80ffff"><i>was to tell
her how much I loved her...</i></font>

1620
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:45,440
I can't.

1621
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:49,556
You can't what?

1622
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,204
Tell you...

1623
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:55,858
Everything. I mean...

1624
01:53:56,907 --> 01:53:58,581
there's so much to tell.

1625
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,738
Yeah.

1626
01:54:01,611 --> 01:54:03,345
There's so much to tell.

1627
01:54:04,478 --> 01:54:05,821
I want you to know...

1628
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,344
that I will always be there for you.

1629
01:54:09,999 --> 01:54:12,782
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1630
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:16,274
I promise you that.

1631
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,000
I will always be your friend.

1632
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:26,633
Only a friend...

1633
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,156
Peter Parker?

1634
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:33,523
That's all I have to give.
