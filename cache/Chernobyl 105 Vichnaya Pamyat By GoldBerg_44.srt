Can you confirm that
the reactor exploded

and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1600 megawatts.

With your approval, we're ready

Three years.

46
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,170
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

47
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,500
He says we can't lower
power any further,

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,750
not for another ten hours.

49

The grid controller?
Where does he get off...

50

It's not the grid
controller's decision, Dyatlov.

Although, we'll never know who.

56
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,750
So, do we have to scrap it or what?

57
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,210
No, I don't think so.

58

If we need to wait ten hours,

59
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,920
- we wait.
- Running at half power,

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,630
You told me to find out what happened.

158
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,840
I spoke to dozens of people.

159
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,460
Every word they said, I wrote down.

160
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,880
All in these books.

161
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,630
These are the ones who are still alive.

162
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,380
These are the ones who are dead.

163
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,420
They died rescuing each other.

164
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,340
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

165
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,210
They didn't hesitate,
they didn't waiver.

166
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,460
They simply did what had to be done.

167
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,410
So have I.

168
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,580
So have I.

169
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,710
I went willingly to an open reactor.

170
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,090
So I've already given my life.

171
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,210
Isn't that enough?

172
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,880
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

173
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,340
The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union

174
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,420
and the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

175
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
has determined that
justice be carried out

176
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,920
on behalf of the People

177
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,500
in accordance with the
general goal of our Party

178
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,290
as determined by its 20th,
21st, and 22nd Congresses,

179
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,290
which is a Leninist goal.

180
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,590
It was, is, and will be

181
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,340
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

182
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,710
The path of Leninist principles

183
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,500
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed

184
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,840
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet People,

185
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,170
its hopes and aspirations

186
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,600
as we guide the life of
the Party and the State.

187
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,710
This session of court is now open,

188
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,840

189

192

Nikolai Fomin...

are accused of violating
Article 220 Section 2

194
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,310
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

195
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,290
resulting in a nuclear
disaster on April 26, 1986.

196
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,880
The State calls
witnesses Comrade Khomyuk

197
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,340
of the Byelorussian Nuclear Institute,

198
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,500
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

199
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,170
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

200
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,670
Deputy Chairman of the
Council of Ministers

201
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,210
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

202
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,750
It began with, of all
things, a safety test.

203
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,750
Why was there need for
a safety test at all?

204
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,090
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

205
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:13,710
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

206
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,750
Eleven days later, on
the last day of the year,

207
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,590
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document...

208
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:28,920
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

209
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,040
As a result of finishing the
work before the end of the year,

210
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,880
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

211
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,630
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

212
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,300
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

213
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,840
But their work was not finished.

214
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,670
And this document was a lie.

215
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,630
In order to sign this certificate,

216
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,090
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

217
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,210
and yet, one remained.

218
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,500
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

219
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,790
A series of pumps, here and here,

220
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,340
send a constant flow of
cooling water through the core.

221
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,880
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

222
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,340
and the steam spins the turbine here,

223
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,710
and the result is electricity.

224
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,460
But what if a power plant has no power?

225
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,000
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,630
A blackout, equipment failure,

227
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,500
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

228
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,380
If there's no power,

229
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,340
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

230
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,210
And without water, the core overheats,

231
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,790
the fuel melts down.

232
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,290
In short, a nuclear disaster.

233
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,040
The solution?

234
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,040
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

235
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,380
So, problem solved?

236
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,920
No.

237
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,710
Bryukhanov knew that the
problem was not solved at all.

238
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,210
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

239
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,590
to reach the speed required

240
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,920
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

241
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,340
and by that time, it would be too late.

242
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,710
So we arrive at the safety test.

243
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,130
The theory was this:{\c} If
the facility lost power,

244
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,040
the turbine, which had been spinning,

245
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,840
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

246
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,290
What if you could take the electricity

247
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,590
it was still generating and
transfer it to the pumps?

248
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,250
What if the dying turbine

249
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,460
could keep the pumps working long enough

250
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,920
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

252

253
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,130
<font color="#138ce9">KADNIKOV:</font> No. Continue, please.

254
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,040
To test this theory,

255
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,090
the reactor is placed in
a reduced power mode...

256
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,750
700 megawatts...

257
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,420
to simulate a blackout condition.

258
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Then the turbines are turned off,

259
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,500
and as they slowly spin down,

260
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,380
their electrical output is measured

261
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,130
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

262
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,460
The science is strong,

263
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,500
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

264
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,290
Now, the first time
they tried, they failed.

265
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,130
The second time they tried, they failed.

266
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,880
The third time they tried, they failed.

267
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,960
The fourth time they tried

268
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,130
was April 26th, 1986.

To understand what happened that night,

272
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,420
we have to go back ten hours earlier...

273
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,000
April 25th, the day the
test was meant to take place.

274
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,340
By two in the afternoon,

275
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,460
the reactor has been lowered by half

276
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,710
from its normal output
level of 3200 megawatts

277
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,000
to 1600 megawatts and is stable

278
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,210
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:{\c}

279
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,210
700 megawatts.

280
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,170
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

281
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,290
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

282
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,750
a further reduction in the
electricity until after midnight.

283
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,380
They are asking for a ten-hour delay.

284
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,380
This is the first critical moment,

285
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,920
the first link in the chain of disaster.

286
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,590
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

287
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,590
These three men allowed it to proceed.

288
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,380
Why was this delay so dangerous?

289
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,130
It created two problems:{\c}

290
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,090
One of them is scientific in nature...

291
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,920
and the other is very human.

292
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,050
This is the one we will consider first.

293
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,090

in the control room of Reactor 4.

the operator responsible for
controlling and stabilizing

363

the reactor that night
was... all of 25 years old.

This is the human problem
created by the delay.

367

But inside the reactor core,

368

in the space between
the atoms themselves,

I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

376
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,710
from the Kurchatov
Institute and Minenergo.

377
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,170
But you don't need to
be a nuclear scientist

378
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,290
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

379
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,380
You only need to know this:{\c}

380
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,040
there are essentially
two things that happen

381
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,750
inside a nuclear reactor.

382
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,380
The reactivity which generates power

383
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,340
either goes up, or it goes down.

384
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,840
That's it.

385
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,090
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

386
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
Uranium fuel.

387
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,840
As uranium atoms split
apart and collide,

388
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,460
reactivity goes up.

389
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,750
But if you don't balance the reactivity,

390
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,960
it never stops rising. So...

391
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,290
Boron control rods.

392
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,920
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

393
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,460
But there's a third
factor to consider:{\c} water.

394
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,420
Cool water takes heat out of the system.

395
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,840
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void".

396
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,340
In an RBMK reactor of the
type used at Chernobyl,

397
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,460
there's something called a
"positive void coefficient".

398
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,290
What does that mean?

399
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,840
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

400
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,920
the higher the reactivity,

401
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,040
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

402
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,670
which means...

403
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,670
It would appear we have a
vicious cycle on our hands.

404
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,630
And we would, were it not for this...

405
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,340
<font color="#ff00ff">(CLATTERS)</font>

406
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:32,040
And we would, were it not for this:{\c}

407
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,540
the negative temperature coefficient.

408
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:41,550
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

409
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,250
fuel increases reactivity.

410
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,290
Control rods and water reduce it.

411
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,670
Steam increases it,

412
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,040
and the rise in temperature reduces it.

413
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,890
This is the invisible dance

414
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,670
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

415
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,040
And it is beautiful

416
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,050
when things are normal.

417
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,290
As uranium splits
apart to release energy,

418
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,880
it breaks down into
a new element, xenon.

419
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,840
Xenon reduces reactivity.

420
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,340
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

421
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,380
When the core is running at full power,

422
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,460
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

423
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,670
But because of the delay,

424
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,630
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

425
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,290
for ten hours.

426
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,050
The xenon did not burn away.

427
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,840
It built up, poisoning the core.

428
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,590
We're starting to lose balance.

And yet, in less than

- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

474

We have to shut down

No. We're doing the test

- Don't talk to me about rules.

- If we fall from 80%...
- No, no. We fell from 50%.

- There is no rule!
- Comrade Dyatlov,

481
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,920
I apologize, but what
you're saying makes no sense.

482
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,630
- Raise the power.
- No.

483
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,590
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

484
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,380
Safety first. Always.

485
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,460
I've been saying that for 25 years.

486
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,590
That's how long I've
done this job, 25 years.

487
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,130
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

488
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,180
Yes.

489
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,290
- Is it much longer?
- Yes.

490
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,420
And you with your mother's
tit barely out of your mouth?

491

So if I say it's safe, it's safe.

The Jews were killed in pogroms,

and Stalin forced the Poles out.

00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,840
it wouldn't happen to me.

00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,790

I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

555
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,670
but when they told me
they were putting me

in charge of the cleanup

557
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
and they said it wasn't
serious, I believed them.

You know why?

559
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,590
Because they put you in charge.

560
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,090
Yeah.

561

have done what I did.

The operators of Reactor

that leads directly to disaster.

They do not yet know
it, but the die is cast.

587
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,840
At 30 megawatts, xenon
is still being created,

588
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,090
but none of it is burning away.

589
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,090
The reactor is drowning in poison.

590
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,250
To make matters worse, the
reactor isn't hot enough

591
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,050
to produce sufficient steam.

592
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,590
The only way to safely
raise power from this state

593
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,960
is to do it very, very slowly

594
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,840
over the course of 24 hours.

595
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,460
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

596
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,960
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

597
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,790
They begin pulling control rods out.

598
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,000
Dozens at a time.

599
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,130
Halfway out, three-quarters
of the way out,

600
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,960
still, the power does not budge.

601
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,750
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

602
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,630
There were 211 control
rods in Reactor 4.

603
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,340
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

604
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,090
Remember... control rods
are the brakes on this car.

605
00:42:54,090 --> 00:43:00,840
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

606
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,960
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

607
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,130
so the negative temperature coefficient

608
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,670
is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

609
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,670
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

610
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,920
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

611
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,960
The control rods are out.

is water and xenon.

can no longer be held back.

780
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:08,880
At long last, we have
arrived. 1:{\c}23:{\c}45, explosion.

781
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,270
In the instant the lid is thrown
off the reactor, oxygen rushes in.

782
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,500
It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.

783
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,420
The chain of disaster is now complete.

the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

789

They didn't know it,

790
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,630
because it was kept from them.

you're contradicting

792
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,590
your own testimony in Vienna.

793
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,380
My testimony in Vienna was a lie.

794
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,460
- <font color="#ff00ff">(CROWD MURMURING)</font>
- I lied to the world.

795
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,880
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

796
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,170
There are many.

797
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,690
We were following orders,

798
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,630
from the KGB, from
the Central Committee.

799
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,380
And right now, there are 16
reactors in the Soviet Union

800
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,920
with the same fatal flaw.

801
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,740
Three of them are still running

802
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,370
less than 20 kilometers
away at Chernobyl.

803
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,340
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet State

804
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,170
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

805
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,320
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

806
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,420
I've already trod on dangerous ground.

807
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,540
We're on dangerous ground right now,

808
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,380
because of our secrets and our lies.

809
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,540
They're practically what define us.

810
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,750
When the truth offends, we lie and lie

811
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,210
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

812
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,210
But it is still there.

813
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,710
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

814
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,710
Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

815
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,420
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

816
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,630
Lies.

817
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,710
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

818
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,840
son of Alexei Legasov,

819
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,380
Head of Ideological
Compliance, Central Committee.

820
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,460
Do you know what your father did there?

821
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes.

822
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,040
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

823
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,380
Communist Youth, correct?

824
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,880
- You already know.
- Answer the question.

825
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,050
Yes.

826
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,040
At the Kuchartov Institute,

827
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,750
you were the Communist Party secretary.

828
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,250
In the position, you limited

829
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,170
the promotion of Jewish scientists.

830
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,090
Yes.

831
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,760
To curry favor with Kremlin officials.

832
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,710
You're one of us, Legasov.

833
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,550
I can do anything I want with you.

834
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,920
But what I want most is
for you to know that I know.

835
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,380
You're not brave.

836
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,590
You're not heroic.

837
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:56,420
You're just a dying
man who forgot himself.

838
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,130
I know who I am, and
I know what I've done.

839
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,170
In a just world, I'd
be shot for my lies,

840
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,420
but not for this, not for the truth.

841
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,630
Scientists...

842
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,460
and your idiot obsessions with reasons.

843
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,790
When the bullet hits your skull,

844
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,340
what will it matter why?

845
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:29,130
No one's getting shot, Legasov.

846
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,040
The whole world saw you in Vienna.

847
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,290
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

848
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,840
And for what?

849
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,710
Your testimony today will
not be accepted by the State.

850
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,840
It will not be
disseminated in the press.

851
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,800
It never happened.

852
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,130
No, you will live,

853
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,000
however long you have,

854
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,790
but not as a scientist, not anymore.

855
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,420
You'll keep your title and your office,

856
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,420
but no duties, no authority, no friends.

857
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,590
No one will talk to you.

858
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,500
No one will listen to you.

859
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,840
Other men, lesser men,

860
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,590
will receive credit for
the things you have done.

861
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,960
Your legacy is now their legacy.

862
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,710
You'll live long enough to see that.

863
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,630
What role did Shcherbina play in this?

864
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,840
None.

865
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,380
He didn't know what I was gonna say.

866
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,840
What role did Khomyuk play in this?

867
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,380
None.

868
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,880
She didn't know either.

869
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,710
After all you've said and done today,

870
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:52,670
it would be curious if you
chose this moment to lie.

871
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,540
I would think a man of your experience

872
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,880
would know a lie when he hears one.

873
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,420
You will not meet or communicate

874
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,670
with either one of them ever again.

875
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,250
You will not communicate with anyone

876
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,380
about Chernobyl ever again.

877
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,920
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

878
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,790
that when you finally do die,

879
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,090
it will be exceedingly hard to
know that you ever lived at all.

880
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,250
What if I refuse?

881
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,590

that isn't going to happen?

889

we fail to consider how few
