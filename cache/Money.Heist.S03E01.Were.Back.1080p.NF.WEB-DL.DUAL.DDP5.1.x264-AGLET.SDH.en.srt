Sergio, my dear friend. How are you?
Long time no see. Come here.

652
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,291
What is this?

653
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:37,541
Do you remember that old plan
to steal gold from the Bank of Spain?

654
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,833
It's remarkable. We can obtain up to
90 tons of gold from the inside there.

655
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,875
We found a way to do it
and I think you're gonna love it.

It's the most brilliant civil engineering
since the Panama Canal. I guarantee it.

No. Wait a minute. Wait.
I've told you a million times.

658
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,458
You can get the gold, but, Andrés,

659
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,875
there's no way you'll leave
the Bank of Spain alive.

660
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:01,500
Well, that's just a small detail.
The gold comes first.

661
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,916
- Then the people, right Andrés?
- That's right.

Brother, do you notice
something different about me?

664
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,208
- No.
