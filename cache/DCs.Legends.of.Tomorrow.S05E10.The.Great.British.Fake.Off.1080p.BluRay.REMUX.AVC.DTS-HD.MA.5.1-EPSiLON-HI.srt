00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:03,392
[Sara] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:05,066
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,425
Remember when we dented history?

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:09,052
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future.

5
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:12,055
[Nate] <i>What you think of as a haunting
is a temporal echo.</i>

6
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,891
<i>She is the you before... you.</i>

7
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,058
[Charlie] <i>Sara, no.</i>

8
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:16,268
<i>My sister...</i>
[gasping]

9
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,437
- [Atropos] You can't kill me.
- No!

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>I'm a god.</i>

11
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:22,441
[grunts]

12
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,044
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

13
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,069
<i>This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.</i>

14
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:28,906
Behrad, he's dead.
Can that Loom bring him back?

15
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,365
If we get the last piece, yeah.

16
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:38,498
[harp playing]

17
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,835
[Charlie] Oh, there you are.

18
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:44,713
It's always the artsy types with you,
ain't it?

19
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,506
How many times must I tell you

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,551
my powers are not a tool
for your amusement, Clotho?

21
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,904
[Nate] <i>Wait, wait, wait... time-out.</i>

22
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,864
But you did look different at the time,
though, right?

23
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,473
[Charlie] Shapeshifter. 'Course I did.

24
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,351
But it makes the story easier
to imagine, if you just picture me.

25
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,144
- Yeah, just pay attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

26
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,605
Anyway, then she said her magic word...

27
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,523
Enchantress.

28
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:11,323
I imagine this has something to do
with your theft of the Loom of Fate?

29
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:12,824
You disapprove?

30
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:15,410
No.

31
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:19,164
Humanity's status quo should be
shaken up every few millennia.

32
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,582
It's good for them.

33
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:25,504
Well, I'm glad you think so,
because this is a pretty big shake-up.

34
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,589
I need to make sure
that no one ever finds this.

35
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:30,592
Not even me,
and especially not Lachesis.

36
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,836
- You think you can do that?
- [Agent Sharpe] <i>Question.</i>

37
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,888
- La-who?
- Lachesis.

38
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:38,183
She's my older sister
and also the leader of the Fates.

39
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,269
Now, she's a real master manipulator.

40
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,396
Atropos kills because Lachesis wills it.

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,816
It is you, Clotho,
that has the difficult task.

42
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,693
What, running and hiding?

43
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,653
I am relieving you
of a piece of the Loom

44
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:52,114
that has been your entire reason
for existence.

45
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,491
Now, that you are free of it...

46
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,827
it will be up to you
to determine what, if anything,

47
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,745
is left of Clotho in its wake.

48
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,916
All I need is to make sure that
that ring is never found.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,544
Existential actualization
can come later.

50
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,758
You cannot run forever, Clotho.

51
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,846
And that's the last thing I remember.

52
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,432
You have no idea
what spell Enchantress cast?

53
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:21,226
That would defeat the whole point
of goin' to her, now, wouldn't it?

54
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,895
Charlie, all we need is the third ring
to bring Behrad back.

55
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,064
And now, you're telling us
it's impossible to find?

56
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:29,151
Maybe you could have mentioned that
before your sister got on the ship.

57
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,129
See, this is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid would happen.

58
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,111
Stop!

59
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,281
Passing blame
is not gonna help anything.

60
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,366
I'm sorry, Z.

61
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,286
This Enchantress is a witch, right?

62
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,537
Well, we have...

63
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,497
whatever it is you are.

64
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,791
So, do some hocus-pocus
and find the ring.

65
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,794
Yeah, well, it's not as simple
as finding Atropos' ring, love.

66
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,589
Locating something hidden by someone
as powerful as Enchantress,

67
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,232
that can take months, maybe even years.

68
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,301
I don't accept that.

69
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,219
Behrad is gone and he's not coming back

70
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:57,888
until you find the ring.

71
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,432
So, figure it out, magic man.

72
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,477
Fast.

73
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:25,998
[knock at door]

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,001
Hey.

75
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,545
You know,

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,465
I'm here for you if you ever
want to talk about Behrad.

77
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,009
We're getting him back.

78
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:41,056
There's no point in dwelling on it,
because everything's going to be fine.

79
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,139
Totally.

80
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,103
By the way, when I went on
that totem journey thing...

81
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,481
I met the other me.

82
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:51,858
Really?

83
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,821
How... how is she?

84
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,075
She's great. Tough, cool...

85
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,537
You must have a thing for warrior women.

86
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,166
Only if they're from another time period
and eventually will leave me. Sure.

87
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,793
[Nate clears throat]

88
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:11,670
Did she have a message for me?

89
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:13,713
No.

90
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:21,012
But I can tell
she really cares about you.

91
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,390
I really care about her.

92
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,226
And just so you know, I, uh...

93
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,936
care about you, too.

94
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,192
Oh, all right, lovebirds,
look, I think I've got something.

95
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,611
Now, it won't be pretty,
but it might just work.

96
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,904
So, come on. Chop-chop.

97
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,712
[sighs]

98
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,679
[Charlie] Sara! Are you there?

99
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,140
Hey, Sara!

100
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,391
Sara?

101
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,645
- You all right?
- Yeah. I just, um...

102
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,151
It was nothing. I'm good.

103
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,197
Listen, you got hit full-force
with the power of Atropos.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,781
- Yeah?
- I know you survived,

105
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,342
but there still could be repercussions.

106
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:27,787
Charlie... look, I'm telling you,
I'm completely fine. All right?

107
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,873
Assassin's honor.

108
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,415
Fine.

109
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,804
[Constantine] All right, you lot.
Listen up.

110
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,964
Lachesis' ring could be anywhere
in space and time.

111
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,693
I'm going to need to borrow a little bit
of magical energy off you lot

112
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,511
to help amplify the summoning spell.

113
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,138
- Exactly how does that work?
- [Constantine] That's easy.

114
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,616
All you need to do
is keep your mouths shut

115
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,767
and let me use your auras
like batteries.

116
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,578
- Is this safe? It doesn't sound safe.
- It isn't.

117
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,355
Any more questions? Good.
Let's hold hands.

118
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,484
[reciting invocation]

119
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,996
- Whoa. This feels weird!
- [Gary] It is weird.

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,123
Kinda like that time
we went mushroom picking.

121
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,459
Focus, or you'll botch the bloody spell!

122
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,253
[Constantine reciting]

123
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,730
[gasps]

124
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,192
- Sara!
- [Constantine] Focus!

125
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,529
[reciting]

126
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,549
[Zari groans]

127
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,719
[classical music playing]

128
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,429
Where is everyone?

129
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:10,390
[Constantine sighs]

130
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,225
Wait. Something happened.

131
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,019
Oh, bollocks.

132
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,438
When everyone lost focus,
I had successfully

133
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,641
bound the ring to the house,

134
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,066
but I was still working
to anchor it temporally.

135
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:24,154
So, you, me and the ring
have been whooshed into the past?

136
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,488
Good work.

137
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:28,742
It's magic, love.
It's more of an art than a science.

138
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,745
[gasps] Oh, my, are those guests?

139
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:33,663
I didn't hear the bell ring.

140
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:38,209
Well, hello! I'm Mrs. Hughes.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

141
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,211
Oh, no bother, love.

142
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,256
This is a lovely... boarding house.

143
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,383
You know,
I could see myself living here.

144
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,553
Now, wherever did my etui get to?

145
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,679
Is it that?

146
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,096
[gasps]

147
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:52,932
Thank you, my dear.

148
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:56,061
I would have found it eventually.

149
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:59,064
Sometimes, one just needs
to stop looking.

150
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,690
- [chuckles]
- Right, totally.

151
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,610
Oh, is that another guest already?

152
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,321
It is, indeed.

153
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,114
Doctor White at your service.

154
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,910
Were you two
going to book a room, or...

155
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,371
Right you are. Yes.
Me and my wife here...

156
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,666
Oh, we're not married. [chuckles]

157
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,168
Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit traditional.

158
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:23,963
I don't allow single women
to stay in my establishment.

159
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,592
But we are engaged. Yay!

160
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,887
My sincerest congratulations!

161
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,890
- Please sign here.
- Oh, yes, of course.

162
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,896
And you will be in
room number three, upstairs.

163
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,898
Supper is at 8:00, sharp.

164
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,359
All right, thank you. Mr. White.

165
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:53,243
Huh. You know, you should take note.
This place can actually look decent

166
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,953
with a bit of TLC.

167
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,847
See what a difference a nice set
of curtains can make?

168
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:00,083
Yeah, all right. Now, let's take stock
of our situation, shall we?

169
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,669
Now, I'm assuming you can wield
the totem like Behrad.

170
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:04,629
Mm-mm.
I'm just holding onto this for him.

171
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:05,964
I don't have a superpower.

172
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,758
- Unless you count having flawless brows.
- I don't.

173
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,510
Oh, and by age 15,

174
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,513
I built a social media empire
valued at over 500 million dollars.

175
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,741
<i>The New York Times</i> called me
the most influential influencer

176
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,560
- of my generation.
- Oh, <i>The New York Times,</i> eh?

177
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,496
Yeah, it's, like,
an app that tells you the news.

178
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,567
So, your superpower
is that you're sort of popular?

179
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,571
Oh, calling me "sort of" popular is like
calling da Vinci "sort of" a genius.

180
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,948
Great. Got it.

181
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,243
What about you?
What exactly do you do,

182
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,329
besides wear the same outfit everyday,
and screw up spells?

183
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,541
I've banished demons, slain dragons
and walked through the fires of Hell.

184
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,978
I'm a sneaky bastard and
the greatest sorcerer that ever lived.

185
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,730
Cool, cool, cool. Do you wanna go ahead
and "sorcer" something

186
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,514
so, we can find the ring
and get out of here?

187
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,467
- Hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,021
Okay. So, does that mean it's in there?

189
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,690
Yeah, it seems so.
This is the doctor's room.

190
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,319
Maybe you could, uh, "influence" him out
while I go check it out?

191
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,529
Mm. See? You need my skill set already.

192
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,158
Yeah, all right. Good luck.
[clears throat]

193
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,411
[Zari clears throat]

194
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,250
Can I help you?

195
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,752
[coughs]

196
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,547
I seem to have come down
with something, Doctor.

197
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,841
Might you be able to give me a checkup?

198
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,802
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

199
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,179
Please. Come in.

200
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,641
Perhaps we could go down
to the sitting room.

201
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,352
I am a newly-engaged woman, after all.

202
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,104
I understand. One moment.

203
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,523
[scoffs]

204
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,569
Ah. Hmm!

205
00:10:58,785 --> 00:10:59,869
No ring?

206
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,455
We're still looking for one.

207
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,124
And you arrived with no luggage,
if I'm not mistaken.

208
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,852
[Zari] Couldn't wait to get away
from the city.

209
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,628
Yes, I could see why your betrothed

210
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,714
would want to get you to himself
as quickly as possible.

211
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,342
- You have a beautiful face.
- Oh, thank you.

212
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,886
- I moisturize.
- It's not like my face.

213
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,722
No one remembers my face.

214
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,849
Huh.

215
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,103
You know, you could, uh, look into
getting a rebranding specialist.

216
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,148
I'm afraid your case is worse
than I thought.

217
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:33,278
I must insist we return to my room
for a more thorough examination.

218
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:39,075
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.
No more cough! [laughs]

219
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,412
You're a real miracle worker, Doc.

220
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:46,124
You should just stay here, relax,
have a drink. And I'm gonna...

221
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,126
Okay, bye-bye.

222
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,174
Ew.

223
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:09,605
John?

224
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,064
John!

225
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,027
It seems we did end up
in my room, after all.

226
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,321
Shall we begin the examination?

227
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:28,832
[White groans]

228
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:32,711
[neck snaps]

229
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,090
John, you killed him!

230
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,760
'Course I did.
He's Jack the bloody Ripper!

231
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,471
Behind you!

232
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,017
[gasps]

233
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Blimey!

234
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,937
Old leather apron here
must be an Encore.

235
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:51,124
Hand me some rope now, will you, love?

236
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,360
Cheers.

237
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,072
[Gideon] Captain Lance is experiencing
unusual activity in the striatum,

238
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,949
a region of the brain
that processes time.

239
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm continuing to run tests
to determine the cause.

240
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,581
So, Atropos not only killed Behrad,
but also managed to put Sara in a coma.

241
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,142
I don't think the team's gonna survive

242
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,644
another run-in
with your sister, Charlie.

243
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:14,438
If we had it my way, we never would've
run into her in the first place.

244
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,941
[Gideon] Pardon me, but Dr. Heywood
and Mr. Green are requesting

245
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,091
your presence on the bridge.

246
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,969
The Prognosticator is showing
unusual Encore activity.

247
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,052
Hey.

248
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,555
You got this, Captain.

249
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,139
Right...

250
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,558
"Captain."

251
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:34,107
All the Encores are moving through time.

252
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,652
More specifically, they're all heading
towards a particular point.

253
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,571
- Looks like they're hunting something.
- Or someone.

254
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,407
Astra must have sent
the Encores after John.

255
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,490
Gideon, pinpoint
where and when they're converging.

256
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,720
See, guys? I knew all my time spent

257
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,430
creating the Prognosticator
would be worth it.

258
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:51,874
- Ava Sharpe saves the day again!
- [Gideon] I'm sorry, Captain.

259
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,918
It appears that
the Prognosticator is not equipped

260
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,920
to handle time-traveling Encores.

261
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,046
[grunts]

262
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,881
Ava, take a deep breath.

263
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,651
You know what, we don't even know
if Sara's gonna wake up.

264
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,987
And if she does, she's going to find out
that two of the Legends are missing.

265
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,429
This is beyond unacceptable.

266
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,888
Let's just sit down.

267
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,057
I'll bring you a cup
of your favorite herbal tea...

268
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,868
[grunts] I'm not just gonna sit around
and do nothing.

269
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,269
If we can't track the Encores,

270
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,604
we have to go after them
at the source... Astra.

271
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,165
I seriously doubt she's just gonna agree

272
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,275
to stop doing whatever
her current evil plan is.

273
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,403
That's why I'm not going
to give her a choice.

274
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,197
Nighty-night, Jackie-boy.

275
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,408
Sweet dreams of disembowelment
and all that jazz.

276
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,868
What the hell, John?

277
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,596
[sighs] Astra must have sent him here
after me.

278
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,831
You know, not everything is about you.

279
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,876
Well, it'd be a big, bloody coincidence
if an Encore just happened

280
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,379
to show up in the same time and place
as us for no apparent reason.

281
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,715
Okay, fine. But I thought
you and Astra had a deal.

282
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,717
Clearly, she got impatient, all right?

283
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,636
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Did you find the ring?

284
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,390
It wasn't in his room. Now something
is interfering with my magic.

285
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,809
Yeah, some great sorcerer...

286
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:53,728
Ooh, some great influencer.

287
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,873
You could barely keep him
distracted for ten minutes.

288
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:59,067
Oh, I'm sorry, should I have
let myself be serial killed,

289
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,736
so, you would've had five more minutes
to not find the ring?

290
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,415
You know what, we should split up,
so we can both find this in peace.

291
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,241
Fine by me, sweetheart.

292
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:08,618
[entry bell rings]

293
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,044
- Howdy, ma'am. My name's Clyde Barrow.
- And my name's Bonnie.

294
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,506
[Clyde] And we're in need
of some accommodations.

295
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,965
Bloody hell. They're all Encores.

296
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:29,907
All right. While I'm down there,

297
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,891
you two need to work on
fixing the Prognosticator,

298
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,374
so we can track down Zari and John.

299
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,977
Well, tech is not really...

300
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,187
Charlie!

301
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,688
Sure. We'll figure it out.

302
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,914
Um, I feel like somebody has to ask you.

303
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,985
Are you 100% certain
you want Gary to take you to Hell?

304
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,463
I was kinda wondering the same thing.

305
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,364
Look, Gary is the only wizard
I have access to.

306
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:47,925
And besides, I'm not only
taking Gary down there.

307
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,469
I'm gonna need some extra muscle, too.

308
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,869
Well, thank you for noticing
the extra reps

309
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,431
- I've been putting on the lat machine.
- [Agent Sharpe] You ready, Mick?

310
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,373
- Oh.
- Mick,

311
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:57,392
I thought you were taking
some time off to hang out with the kid.

312
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,544
She told me to go to Hell.
Where are we headed?

313
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,588
The portal to Hell is ready, Captain.
All that's left is for...

314
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,466
me to drink some of this demon blood.

315
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,260
- Come on, Gary.
- [Gary] Yeah.

316
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,137
Ugh.

317
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,560
- Oh. It's actually quite tangy.
- Okay. How do we do this?

318
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,784
I will say some words, and then
the sigil will transport us to Hell

319
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,482
for precisely four hours.

320
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,693
After that,
we'll be transported right back here.

321
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,986
Sounds good to me.

322
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:26,696

I call upon you."

00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,604
All right, Mick,
get ready to light it up.

- Beer?
- Yeah.

330
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,852
[Gary] This was a terrible idea.

331
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,854
Should have worn
shoulder pads to blend in.

332
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,731
[Mick] I like it. There's fire.

333
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,274
Let's just find Astra.

334
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,817
About time we killed the bitch.

335
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,778
No! John has been working so hard
to rehabilitate her.

336
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,423
Also, I thought we didn't use
that word anymore.

337
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,049
You know what, I'm gonna let the B-word
slide this time.

338
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,634
She sent a bunch of criminals
after our friends.

339
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,511
How do we even find her?
What are we supposed to do,

340
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,287
just ask a random demon off the streets?

341

- [gasps]
- [weapon whirs]

342
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,625
- Where's Astra?
- She's at her club.

343
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,919
Uh, it's two streets down, make a left.

344
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,881
Wow. I didn't expect that to work.
Thanks, Micky!

345
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,243
Oh, it's times like this that
I wish I hadn't given up smoking.

346

Yeah, well, I wish I had brought
my own hairbrush.

347
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,104
Guess we're both out of luck.

348
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,065
Why would Astra send
so many Encores after me?

349
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,525
I mean... seems like overkill.

350
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,153
Again, maybe it's not all about you.

351
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:50,655
What if they're after the ring?

352
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,842
You know, I never told Astra
about the Loom of Fate,

353
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,284
but you might be onto something.

[clock chimes]

Oh, look at that. Suppertime!

356
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,875
[chuckles] You're not
seriously suggesting

357
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,627
we go dine with Hell-people?

358
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,713
I'm seriously suggesting that
you stay here, while I handle it.

359
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:11,509
I'm part of this,
and possess far superior social skills.

360
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,970
Yeah. Well, you bottled it
when Jack the Ripper attacked.

361
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,429
Look, I can't look after you

362
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,513
and figure out what Astra's up to
at the same time.

This might be Behrad's totem,

but there is a little warrior me
inside here

from a different timeline,
and she's gonna protect me.

I don't even know what to say to that.

367

But I will say this.

Even if I have to tie you up myself,

What are you doing?

373
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,502
Well, I can't exactly go out there
as John Constantine now, can I?

374
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,089
I think I have an idea.

375
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,721
Clyde and I were tortured
by Manaxos the Mutilator himself.

376
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:00,057
Your pain was a mere trifle compared
to what the Norfulthing did to me.

377
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:03,352
And I thought the Hellhounds
were the worst evil a man could suffer.

378
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,230
Who exactly are you
that you were worth Norfulthing's time?

00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,649
[Henry VIII]
I am, of course, King Henry VIII,

ruler of the British Empire.

381
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:13,237
And what crime sent you to Hell?

- We rob banks.

You may have heard of me.

00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,495
The name's Black Caesar.

Caesar?

387
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,207
Ah, and you must be Brutus.

388
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,044
I always favored beheadings
over stabbing someone in the back.

389
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,337
Less cowardly.

Supper is ready!

[bouncer] Excuse me, Miss Astra?

395
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,735
I found this scum
lurking by the entrance.

396
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,821
"Lurking" seems like an overly
sinister way to describe...

Why are you here, twerp?

398
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,450
John Constantine is outside.

He knows you're impatient with him,
but he has the thing he promised you.

400
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,681
But he doesn't want to come in here
and risk being seen.

and I'll let my demonic friends here

What if she's telling the truth?

You've got quite the reputation, Jack.

My mistake, sugar.

424
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:13,149
I would have noticed if the ring
was sitting directly in front of me.

So, we are all here for the ring.

Great, you all have scary weapons.
Now that we know that,

is it really necessary for everyone
to get cramps in their arms?

and he's enjoying some entertainment.

470
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,353
Yeah, I'll definitely be seeing
that one again down here.

471
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,773
Oh, you're no fun.

472
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,776
Now, this is where I keep
all my soul coins.

473
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,738
And as you can see, they're all right...

474
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,658
Did you lose something?

475
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:15,831
No one with an "executive privacy"
button has good intentions.

476
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,542
My vault is empty.

477
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:22,755
Besides me, you're the only one
with access, Tiberius. Care to explain?

478
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,256
Is this one of those human pranks?

479
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,508
You had me take them out
for you last week.

480
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:27,885
Like hell I did.

481
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,346
I swear it, I saw you myself.

482
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,516
A shapeshifter. Damn it!

483
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:35,893
[grunts]

484
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,061
[gasps]

485
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:38,895
[thud]

486
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,524
Oh, don't look at me like that.
He'll be fine in a few hours.

487
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,361
Better, even, 'cause he'll have learned
to be less gullible.

488
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,571
At least
the most valuable one is still...

489
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,704
Who the hell is Vandal Savage?

490
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,332
- Oh, I actually know that one. He's...
- Shut up!

491
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,503
I can't believe she did this to me.

492
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,380
Wait. You know who stole your coins?

493
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,130
Yeah.

494
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,634
But she is...

495
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,596
too powerful for me to take on.

496
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,598
Okay. What if you had backup, you know?

497
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,266
"Enemy of my enemy" sort of thing.

498
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,352
Fine.

499
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,354
But this will require stealth.

500
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:24,149
Wakey-wakey.

501
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,819
The boys stay here.

502
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,326
Now, that was influencing.

503
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,330
You really think
there's a saint's chance in Hell

504
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,412
that your truce is gonna hold?

505
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:39,873
May I remind you
that one of them is ruddy Brutus!

506
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,917
Sorry, was that some weird
British-y way of saying

507
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,812
- "Thank you for saving my life, Zari"?
- [chuckles]

508
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,130
Yeah, okay. All right.
I was in a bit of a pickle.

509
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,674
I admit it,
but may I suggest that we use

510
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,342
the few minutes that you bought us

511
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:52,052
- to go and look for the ring?
- Shh.

512
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:08,986
[gun cocks]

513
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,905
Sorry about this, hon.

514
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,574
Please, don't.

515
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,284
Don't be scared.

516
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,996
"The evil that men do lives after them,"
and all that.

517
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,186
So, who's this being we're going to see?

518
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,296
The woman
who found me terrified and alone

519
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,506
when John left me to rot down here.

520
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:33,051
She took me in, raised me,
taught me how to make it in Hell.

521
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,179
Wow. And now she's betrayed you.

522
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,140
She was the one person
I thought I could trust.

523
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,058
Everything I am, I owe to her.

524
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,747
You know, I don't know if that is
some sob story or what, Astra,

525
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,230
but I know how you feel.

526
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,066
I think it's a pretty specific story.

528
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,779
Yeah, well, I had a mentor once.
The guy's name was Rip.

529
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,782
I trusted him with my life
until I found out that

530
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:57,034
he fabricated all my memories
to make me good at my job.

531
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,204
That's awful. So what did you do
when you found out, did you kill him?

532
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,622
Ooh. [chuckles]

533
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,207
I wanted to so bad.

534
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,335
But, you know,
the one thing that I learned is...

535
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,738
the only way to keep going
is to take control of your life.

536
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,399
Stop letting everybody act like
they know what's best for you

537
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,966
and make your own choices, you know?

538
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:14,926
What the...

539
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:16,594
[Agent Sharpe scoffs]

540
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,556
So, it was a sob story, after all.

541
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,519
No, it was the truth.
Thanks for the therapy session.

542
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,646
Don't have too much fun
without me, boys.

543
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,356
I'll be back soon.

544
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,162
Show me the treasure I seek!

545
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,872
[compass chimes]

546
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,210
That compass must have
some sort of Hell powers.

547
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,670
He's using it to track the ring.

548
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,631
- Okay, then we need to get the compass.
- All right. I'll grab it.

549
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,466
Hey. I'm going with you.

550
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,095
All right. Follow me.

551
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,604
[exclaims]

552
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,192
[Zari clears throat]

553
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,570
Hey.

554
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:23,287
[chuckles] Well, that was
bloody convenient, wasn't it?

555
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,545
I tried to fight them. Just like Rory.

556
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,964
You folded like
a cheap deck of cards, you bum.

557
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,258
[grunts] Easy.

558
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,386
It's okay, Gary.
I totally got played by Astra.

559
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,325
On the bright side,
there's not much time left on the sigil.

560
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,226
We'll pop back
to the <i>Waverider</i> soon enough.

561
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:50,188
Um, about that...
I'm the one who cast the spell.

562
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,917
So, I'll pop back to the <i>Waverider,</i>
along with anyone who's touching me

563
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,401
when the time runs out.

564
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,068
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,197
- Didn't I mention that?
- [both] No!

566
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,867
Listen, you dweeb.
I gotta get out of here. I got a thing.

567
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,326
What thing?

568
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,204
Lita has a soccer match.

569
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,790
She didn't invite me,
but I'm inviting myself.

570
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:09,875
Sorry, Rory.

571
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,544
And I refuse to die here
without getting to know my daughter.

572
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,088
Do we understand each other?

573
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,133
- What position does she play?
- Gary.

574
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,389
[sighs] Hold on,
we were here just a minute ago.

575
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,224
John, we are going in circles.

576
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,037
Yeah, it seems like it's not just
my magic that's wonky in this place.

577
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,521
Magic or no, there's so many people
looking for this ring,

578
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,023
it should've turned up by now.

579
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,609
It's like [sighs]
it doesn't want to be found.

580
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,863
Hold on a minute,
you might be onto something.

581
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,700
"Sometimes you just have
to stop looking," right?

582
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:44,952
Why would we stop looking?

583
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,578
Because I'm beginning to suspect

584
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,456
that the spell on the ring
is of a particular breed.

585
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,667
So, if you want to find the ring...

586
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,502
you can't find it.

587
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,171
[chuckles]

588
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:59,591
You've gotta hand it to Enchantress,
she is a crafty one.

589
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:03,178
Okay, it's not just gonna
slip our minds. So, what do we do?

590
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,015
We drink.

591
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,402
I know what you did, Lachesis.

592
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,742
- Who's she?
- Astra, my dear,

593
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,161
I'd like you to meet my sister, Atropos.

594
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,248
I've wanted you two to meet
for quite some time now.

595
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,125
Your sister?

596
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,420
We've worn many faces in our long lives,

597
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,130
but we are family.

598
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,674
Anything you need to say to me,
you can say in front of her.

599
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,593
I know you stole my soul coins.

600
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,514
Of course I did. I had to.

601
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,225
Astra, they were becoming a distraction.

602
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,687
You'd amassed all this power
for what? Parties?

603
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,731
Gambling?

604
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:59,735
- You need to think in grander terms.
- Much grander.

605
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:03,739
You see, Astra, my sister and I...

606
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,825
are two of the three Fates.

607
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,911
The Loom of Fate belongs to us.

608
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,496
It is our birthright.

609
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,168
- Why... why didn't you tell me?
- [laughs] You weren't ready.

610
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,005
Oh, Astra, making soul coins

611
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,717
and using them to control
the denizens of Hell

612
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,720
was a cheap reflection
of my former glory.

613
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,849
Now, that the Loom of Fate
is within reach...

614
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,352
I want you to become one of us.

615
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,480
Become our third sister.

616
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,858
You'd have the power of a god.

617
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,570
Astra, this is what
I have been preparing you for

618
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,530
ever since I took you in
as a young girl.

619
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,408
But what about my mom?

620
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,952
John had promised that
he'd use the Loom of Fate

621
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,370
to make it so she never died.

622
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:57,626
Astra, you need to move beyond
these petty human desires!

623
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:02,798
I am offering you the power
to design destiny.

624
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,926
You once sought to rule over Hell...

625
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,513
Now, you can rule over the whole cosmos.

626
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,057
Will you join us?

627
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,185
What do you say, girl?

628
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,646
Trust me, Astra.
I know what's best for you.

629
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,022
Sister always knows best.

630
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,777
Of course, I'll join you.

631
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,905
How could I ever turn down
so much power?

632
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,323
Good girl.

633
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,450
There's just one thing.

634
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:33,870
John Constantine's coin.

635
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,455
He's mine to toy with.

636
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,333
Seems like a fair trade.

637
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,517
[sighs]

638
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,004
[Bonnie] I took care of Brutus.

639
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,905
And I got our pirate friend, Caesar.

640
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,699
Any luck with the ring?

641
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,492
Damn thing might as well be invisible.

642
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,620
Well, Bonnie, guess we got no choice
but to make the rest

643
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,664
- of our fellow guests disappear.
- Mmm.

644
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,169
- [thudding]
- [grunting]

645
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,842
Now, what do we have here?

646
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,552
Another Hell-ian to kill?

647
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,137
Lucky us.

648
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,515
- I'm Jack the Ripper.
- Nice try.

649
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,808
We already met Jack.

650
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:39,102
That Jack's an imposter. Worse...

651
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,355
- It's John Constantine.
- That liar!

652
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,039
He must be here to send us back to Hell.

653
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,026
Now, don't lose your temper, Bonnie.

654
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,320
We'll teach that grifter a lesson, okay?

655
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,866
[sighs deeply]

656
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,784
Good old Mrs. Hughes.

657
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,370
Okay, I'm not thinking about the ring.

658
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,372
I'm not thinking about the ring.

659
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,082
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

660
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,752
So, you're just gonna accept failure
when we are this close?

661
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:04,961
I'm not giving up.

662
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,380
Oh, I don't see it as giving up,
so much as...

663
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,133
accepting reality.

664
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,593
I know myself.

665
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:16,181
I'm a ripe old mix of guilt and torment.

666
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,184
If the Loom of Fate offers me
even one glimmer of hope

667
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,728
of redemption for all my past sins,

668
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,481
particularly Astra, then...

669
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,859
I'll never not be thinking about it.

670
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,239
You know, it's funny,
I'm usually an expert

671
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,532
at getting things out of my head.

672
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,747
Boyfriend cheating on me
with my assistant/best friend?

673
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,417
No time to cry,
I have a fall fashion line to plan.

674
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,421
Overhearing my mother tell a friend
she's embarrassed

675
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,049
her daughter is so shallow
and self-absorbed?

676
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:55,679
Definitely can't process that,
I will check my Cat-Chat analytics.

677
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:05,480
But my baby brother dying
because he was trying to protect me?

678
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,944
There is nothing that can get that
out of my head.

679
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,661
I was wearing the totem when he died.

680
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,249
If I hadn't been, maybe he...

681
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,878
Maybe he would have had a chance.

682
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:31,422
[sniffs]

683
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,261
Look, you can take it from an expert...

684
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:38,972
[sighs]

685
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:43,935
Nothing good ever comes
from beating yourself up, love.

686
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,854
Don't try to make me feel better.

687
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,443
John.

688
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,779
What if we don't find the ring?

689
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,448
What if I never get him back?

690
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,075
[Clyde] Yoo-hoo!

691
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,871
- John friggin' Constantine!
- We know who you are,

692
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,749
and there's someone here
you'll be just dying to meet.

693
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,002
They do say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

694
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:13,506
[breathes heavily]

695
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,510
This passage leads outside.
I'll distract them while you escape.

696
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,846
- No, come with me.
- Go.

697
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,183
This is my house
and I'm just crazy enough to defend it.

698
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,768
And listen...

699
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,478
you can get Behrad back, Zari.

700
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,831
I truly believe that. But unless
you get out of here right now,

701
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,648
then neither of you stand a chance.

702
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,902
Okay.

703
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:37,529
[sighs]

704
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,218
Ava, I'd just like to say,
you're the best boss I've ever had.

705
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,553
Well, the only boss I've ever had.

706
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,723
I'm more apprentice
than employee with John.

707
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,100
And before the Bureau, well...

708
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,144
Ah! Finally, you've come to kill us.

709
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,939
About time. I was getting bored!

710
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,983
[groans]

711
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,070
[Astra] Get out of here.

712
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,966
Astra, what made you change your mind?

713
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,631
You're helping John
find the Loom for me.

714
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,909
Might as well let you.

715
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:25,495
Either he'll come through,
or Lachesis is bound to.

716
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,789
Did you say "Lachesis"? The Fate?

717
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:29,833
Wait, how do you know who...

718
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,501
It's a small underworld after all.

719
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,336
- Time's almost up!
- Come with us.

720
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:34,921
- What?
- What?

721
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,690
[Agent Sharpe] Astra, it's time
for you to take control.

722
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:37,714
Don't wait for them.

723
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,027
You can help us find the Loom
and save your mother yourself.

724
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,136
Ten seconds left!

725
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,388
The choice is yours.

726
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,144
Wait, did she ever channel an animal
while you were, you know...

727
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,644
She did once.

728
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:51,688
But it was...

729
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,986
- Is that...
- Meet Astra.

730
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,529
Why does she have the sword?

731
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,292
There's no time to explain.
We got to move.

732
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,911
Where's the ring, John?

733
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,663
I don't know where the ring is.

734
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:11,291
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you muppets.

735
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,751
John. John, be reasonable.

736
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,795
We are going to kill you, regardless.

737
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,840
But it's up to you
how painful that death has to be.

738
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:19,841
[chuckles]

739
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,344
You'd be surprised how long
you can stay alive without...

740
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,511
certain organs.

741
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,018
- You want your coat back, don't ya?
- Mm.

742
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,936
You can all go to Hell!

743
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,396
Hmm.

744
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,735
Stop!

745
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,528
Cleopatra?

746
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,490
Yes.

747
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,408
I order you to stop.

748
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,219
You don't have
that kind of power here, honey.

749
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,204
Are you both serious? She's with him!

750
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:50,747
Is that so?

751
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,373
Maybe this will make you talk.

752
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,250
I don't know
where the ring is, all right?

753
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,879
Funny, I believe you. What a shame.

754
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,799
- Cheer up, darlin'. We can kill him now.
- Mmm.

755
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,593
- No!
- [totem howls]

Blimey.

765
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:55,852
What?

766
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,022
The bloody ring.

767
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,656
[chuckles] Must have been here
the whole time.

768
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,284
I guess I stopped thinking about it.

769
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,455
Guys! We're here to save you!

770

But, uh...

771
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,669
it looks like you took care of that
on your own.

772
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,605
Thank God. Please tell me
that you found the ring?

773
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:24,632
We did. Thanks to Zari.

774
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,093
- Fantastic.
- Good.

775
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Wait a second.
Are those Hell weapons?

776
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,262
Yeah.

777
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,931
We could use those, especially...

778
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,815
Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

779
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,352
- Good morning!
- [all gasp]

Are those even more guests?

Oh! Um, no.
So sorry, ma'am, we were just leaving.

782
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,614
And, uh...

783
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,658
here's me thinking
you weren't allowed to meddle anymore.

784
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,369
You could've been a touch more direct.

785
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,622
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,750
[chuckles] Yeah. Right.

787
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,842
See you around, John Constantine.

788
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,514
So, you got the totem to work?

789
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,433
Yeah, I did. It was amazing.

790
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,310
Terrifying, but amazing.

791
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,230
And I sort of felt like
Behrad was there with me.

792
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,068
He'd be so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you. Congratulations.

793
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,445
[Gary] John!

794
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:28,572
You're safe!

795
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,699
All right, Gary. Oh! Okay, all right.
Calm down, all right?

796
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,326
I'm happy to see you, too, mate.

797
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,619
Hey, how's Sara doing?

798
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,830
Oh, she's still unconscious.
Charlie is sitting with her now.

799
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:40,958
I'm gonna try to distract myself
by fixing the Prognosticator.

800
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,728
Technical skills aren't
Charlie and I's strong suit.

801
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,296
- I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a tick.

802
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,007
If that contraption is broke,
how the hell did you find us?

803
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,842
Uh, about that...

804
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,469
Hey, John.

805
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,683
I hear we have a Loom to build.

806
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,650
