00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,654
I was waiting for you.

165
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,698
I don't want to be you.

166
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,075
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i> I don't blame you.

167
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:01,540
You won't be here forever.
You won't be an old man in a tree.

168
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,461
But before you leave, you must learn.

169
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,131
Learn what?

170
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,383
Everything.

171
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,345
<i>(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)</i>

172
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,366
Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.

173
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,904
Welcome home, Khaleesi.

174

<i>(DOOR CREAKING)</i>

175
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,514

<i>(DOOR OPENS)</i>

177
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,442
What are you doing?!

178
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,860
Take your hands off me!

179
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,529
I will have your heads!

180
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,427
You have made a mistake.

181
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,554
One you will regret.

182
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,305
I am the wife of the Great Khal.

183
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,807
We know who you are.

184
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,810
I remember you eating
the stallion's heart.

185
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:32,816
Why didn't you come to us
after Khal Drogo died?

186
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,068
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

187
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,611
the Breaker of Chains,

188
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,780
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

189
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,824
My place is not here with you.

190
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,493
You were the wife of the Great Khal.

191
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:48,248
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

192
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,791
He didn't.

193
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,378
I was the wife of the Great Khal.

194
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,005
Khal Savo.

195
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,969
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

196
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,098
You're young.

197
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,351
We were all young once.

198
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,688
But we all understand
the way things are.

199
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,191
You will learn as well,

200
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,235
if you are fortunate enough
to stay with us.

201
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,571
Where else would I go?

202
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,741
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

203
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,828
Yes. Immediately after the death
of their khal.

204
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,663
But you went out into the world.

205
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,540
That is forbidden.

206
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,921
All the khalasars have returned
for the Khalar Vezhven.

207
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:42,052
They will decide which cities will be sacked
and which tribes will be enslaved.

208
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:46,723
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

209
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,685
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

210
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,730
It is the best you can hope for, now.

211
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,203
I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

212
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,295
If we could have the room.

213
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,059
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

214
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,063
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

215
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,608
If you're going to torture me,
just call them back and get on with it.

216
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,151
I am not a torturer.

217
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,115
Though it so often is what people deserve.

218
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,870
And it does provide answers.

219
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,998
But they're usually the wrong answers.

220
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,459
My job is to find the right answers.

221
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,628
Do you know how I do that?

222
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,047
I do it by making people happy.

223
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,342
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

224
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,928
That's your name, isn't it? Vala.

225
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:13,268
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i> That's all right.
I know who you are and what you've done.

226
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,813
You've done a lot.

227
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,859
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,
which is more than most people do.

228
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:28,617
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy
murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.

229
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:32,621
The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers,

230
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,041
brought here by a foreign queen
to destroy our city and our history.

231
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,210
I understand.

232
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,757
Well, that makes perfect sense
from your perspective.

233
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,970
I have a different perspective, of course.

234
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,891
I think it's important that you try to see things
from my perspective,

235
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,101
just as I will try to see them from yours.

236
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:00,440
Because that is the only way
that I can make you and Dom happy.

237
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,738
That is how you pronounce it, "Dom"?

238
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,367
I'm afraid
I don't really speak the language.

239
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,204
Such a handsome boy.

240
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,832
Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

241
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,503
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

242
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,006
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

243
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,217
Children are blameless.

244
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,886
I have never hurt them.

245
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,474
Your boy is in no immediate danger,
this I swear to you.

246
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:41,940
But between us, dear,
you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.

247
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,150
We both know the penalty for that crime.

248
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,743
How will poor Dom get on
without his mother?

249
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,578
And with his breathing problem.

250
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,455
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

251
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,291
So either you kill me or they do.

252
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,378
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

253
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,632
There is a third option, though.

254
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,927
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

255
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,681
I've already booked passage
for a woman and her young son.

256
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,269
I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

257
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,856
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
one of our leather-clad friends

258
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,190
back in to carry it.

259
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,359
Far too heavy for me.

260
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,654
The boat sails at dawn.

261
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,615
You need to decide now.

262
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,411
A new life for you and Dom, or...

263
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,973
What should we do while we wait?
To pass the time, what should we do?

264
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,641
What should we talk about?

265
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,772
You speak 19 languages.

266
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,357
You must occasionally use some of them
to talk about things.

267
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,778
You two, you spend
a great deal of time together.

268
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,781
What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

269
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,492
Patrol.

270
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,287
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

271
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,833
What we see on patrol.
Who we captured on patrol.

272
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,294
That's good. That's very good.

273
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:33,426
But that's a report.
I was thinking more of a conversation.

274
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,679
A wise man once said,
"The true history of the world

275
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,016
"is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms."

276
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,352
Who said this?

277
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,688
Me. Just now.

278
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,574
All right, no conversations.
Let's play a game.

279
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,913
You don't play games?
Either one of you, ever?

280
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,206
Games are for children.

281
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,709
My master Kraznys
would sometimes make us play games.

282
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,670
There, that's a start.

283
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,713
Only the girls.

284
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,132
Oh... No, no, no.

285
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,884
Not that. Of course, not that.

286
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,055
Innocent games. Fun games. Drinking games.

287
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,558
MISSANDEI: We do not drink.

288
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,768
Until you do.

289
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:30,400
All right. No drinking.
We can play without drinking.

290
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,903
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.
Here's how it works.

291
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:37,532
I make a statement about your past.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

292
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,284
And if I'm right...

293
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,035
<i>(GASPS)</i>

294
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,079
Maybe we can't play without drinking.

295
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,248
<i>(DOOR OPENS)</i>

296
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,418
Oh, you took your time.

297
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:50,795
VARYS: Sorry.

298
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,507
I was busy learning
who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

299
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,675
Some things you can't rush.

300
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:56,801
You found out?

301
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,972
The Good Masters of Astapor
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

302
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,350
With help from their friends in Volantis.

303
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,894
TYRION: You see?

304
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,605
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

305
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,275
We only have to worry about
the three rich foreign cities paying for it.

306
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:16,154
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
We will do it again and execute the Masters.

307
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:19,282
If the Unsullied march off to
re-conquer Astapor and Yunkai,

308
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,093
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

309
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,453
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

310
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,413
We cannot.

311
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,790
The Masters speak only one language.

312
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,170
They spoke it to me for many years.
I know it better than my mother tongue.

313
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,215
If we want them to hear us,
we must speak it back to them.

314
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,926
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

315
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,470
You may be right.

316
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,388
So we will fight them?

317
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,015
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

318
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,392
It's a conversation.

319
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,771
Tell me, can your little birds get a message

320
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,941

He was on her list.

He was not on her list anymore.

484
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,846
She had taken him off it.

Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?

ARYA: She did and she did not.

She sounds confused.

Yes, she was.

JAQEN: If a girl tells me her name,
I will give her eyes back.

501

A girl has no name.

Come.

No one.

The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

Famously loyal to the Starks.

508
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,675
And you, Lord Karstark,

509
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,596
your people share blood
with the Starks, don't they?

510
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,057
But here we are. Times change.

511
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,853
When my father became Warden of the North,
your house refused to pledge their banners.

512
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,146
Your father was a cunt.

513
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,777
My beloved father, the Warden...

514
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,947
Your father was a cunt,
and that's why you killed him.

515
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,283
I might have done the same to my father

516
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,828
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

517
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,372
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

518
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,165
Mmm.

519
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,086
Why have you come to Winterfell,
Lord Umber?

520
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:53,423
The bastard Jon Snow
led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

521
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,425
We're farther north than any of you fuckers.

522
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:58,887
Wildlings come down,
we always have to fight them first.

523
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,723
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all me life.

524
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:04,852
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

525
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,479
So now you've come seeking help?

526
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,399
We need to help each other.

527
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,444
The colder it gets, the farther south
those goat-fuckers will roam.

528
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:15,839
Won't take them long to get here.

529
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:18,699
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

530
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,619
If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.
He knows this place better than we ever will.

531
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:31,253
Pledge your banners to House Bolton,
swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North,

532
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,462
and we will fight together

533
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,257
to destroy the bastard
and all his wildling friends.

534
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:37,259
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

535
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,429
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

536
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,222
I'm not doing that either.

537
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,017
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

538
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,061
Your father honored tradition.

539
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:53,150
Knelt for Robb Stark.
Called him King of the North.

540
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:55,444
Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

541
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,654
Then it appears we're at a bit of
an impasse.

542

Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
I've got a gift for you.

543

Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

I had a choice, Lord Commander.

562

Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

563
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,123
You brought an army of wildlings

An army of murderers and raiders.
