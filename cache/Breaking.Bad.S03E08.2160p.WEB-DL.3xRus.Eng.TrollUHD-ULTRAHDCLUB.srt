1
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,957
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,627
Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,591
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,802
So roll me further, bitch.

5
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,658
What's coming?

6
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,953
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

7
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,627
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,756
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,464
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,100
Appears pale and diaphoretic.
How many entry wounds?

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,472
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,309
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible exit wounds.

13
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,102
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,522
- What's his hemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,150
Need two large-bore IVs, six units O-neg.

16
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,195
Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

17
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,323
Notify the OR, we are on the way.

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,202
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

19
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,026
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,198
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,576
That's messed up.

22
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,245
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,247
Actually

24
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,251
I'm great.

25
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,234
I don't understand.

26
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,612
I thought things were going pretty well.

27
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,449
{\an8}I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,369
{\an8}You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,957
{\an8}Not... Not so much, no.

30
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,462
{\an8}Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,464
{\an8}No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,468
{\an8}It's much more than that.

33
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,470
Could you elaborate?

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,181
Well, yes, of course I could,

35
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,976
but I don't think either of us

36
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,021
would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

37
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,108
Yeah, so...

38
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,443
Yeah.

39
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,279
I set up the entire lab.

40
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,782
You said you liked the configuration.

41
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,700
And I do.

42
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,994
For the most part.

43
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,083
{\an8}Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,419
{\an8}It's just that I...

45
00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:01,628
{\an8}That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

46
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,178
You see... It's...

47
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,016
{\an8}It's as if I'm classical,

48
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:13,814
{\an8}but you are more jazz.

49
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,526
- Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

50
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,529
And God knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

51
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:26,326
It's simply that I require...

52
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,246
- Classical.
- Exactly.

53
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,375
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,545
{\an8}Man, this is the bomb.

55
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,762
What's up, partner?

56
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,476
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

57
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,562
Oh, Jesus.

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
Hi. Gale.

59
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,567
{\an8}- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

60
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,320
{\an8}Damn, we should've ditched that RV
months ago.

61
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,072
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

62
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,788
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

63
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,916
- This...
- No.

64
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,879
...makes no sense.

65
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:31,099
{\an8}So I guess this is...

66
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,938
{\an8}Oh, dear mother of God.

67
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,276
This is for the best.

68
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,405
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

69
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,407
{\an8}Yeah.

70
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,785
{\an8}Oh, man.

71
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,746
Mr. White.

72
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

73
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,262
Some new techniques to learn.

74
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,891
{\an8}- What, now?
- Yes, now.

75
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,061
{\an8}We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

76
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,979
And I need to get you up to speed.

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,068
{\an8}Right on. I'm just saying...

78
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,114
How's the cell service down here?

79
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,949
It's nonexistent.

80
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,575
{\an8}We're shielded.

81
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,078
{\an8}There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

82
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,455
So you haven't talked to anybody today

83
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,291
other than, you know, Captain Nerd there.

84
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,585
Why?

85
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,380
Your brother-in-law.

86
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,841
What about him?

87
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,304
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

88
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,640
You getting exposure on those wounds?

89
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,017
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

90
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,051
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

91
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,648
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

92
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,943
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

93
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,236
Where's that blood?

94
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,322
{\an8}<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

95
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,908
{\an8}<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

96
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,286
{\an8}- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

97
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,997
{\an8}- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,627
{\an8}Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

99
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,009
I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,762
I don't know what to say.

101
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,812
{\an8}- How is he?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,899
{\an8}They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

103
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,903
They shot him four times.

104
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,864
Oh, Christ.

105
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,746
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,335
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

107
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,045
Yeah?

108
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,256
{\an8}Sure?

109
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,594
{\an8}I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

110
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,972
{\an8}Okay.

111
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,602
{\an8}- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

112
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:28,944
{\an8}Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

113
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,071
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

114
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,572
Thank you.

115
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,117
Can you tell us anything?
Any details?

116
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,912
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

117
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,123
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

118
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,753
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with a drug cartel.

119
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,091
{\an8}Why did they attack Hank?

120
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,759
{\an8}We're not sure yet.

121
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,930
{\an8}It could be in relation to an
investigation Hank was working,

122
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,643
{\an8}or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

123
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,438
They had an axe.

124
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,860
{\an8}The cartels tend to be dramatic.

125
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,862
Jesus.

126
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,784
{\an8}- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

127
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,621
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

128
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,542
{\an8}Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out

129
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,378
{\an8}considering he didn't even have his gun.

130
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,341
He didn't have his gun?

131
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,640
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

132
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,476
Marie, the assault charge.

133
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,479
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

134
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,608
That means I had to take away his weapon.

135
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,318
You had to take it.

136
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,445
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

137
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,117
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate

138
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,876
he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

139
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,787
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

140
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,208
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

141
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,087
It's their fault.

142
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,298
He didn't have a gun.

143
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,508
Honey, this isn't helping you.

144
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,385
You.

145
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,555
What kind of partner are you?

146
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,393
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

147
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,479
Where were you?

148
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,564
Texas.

149
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,651
And you.

150
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,987
You're supposed to protect your agents

151
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,198
instead of taking their guns

152
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,201
not supporting them, not backing them up.

153
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,869
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

154
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,707
Honey, let's just go and sit down, okay?

155
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,712
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

156
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,095
- Sorry...
- Go.

157
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,138
You are not welcome here.

158
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,685
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

159
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,019
Come on.

160
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,605
Come on. Let's go sit down.

161
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,245
It's not just them.

162
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,290
It's you, Walt.

163
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:40,093
This Pinkman that Hank was looking for

164
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,221
Hank would have never even heard his name

165
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,100
if you hadn't bought marijuana from him.

166
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,228
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

167
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,147
Do you?

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,442
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

169
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,694
Marie, stop.

170
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,947
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame,

171
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,908
and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

172
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,619
It's not his fault.

173
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,712
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,715
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

175
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,972
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

176
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,932
It's all right.

177
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,035
All right, you're done.

178
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,498
Okay, next.

179
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,802
Hello.

180
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,974
Hello, hello, hello.

181
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,064
Yeah.

182
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:53,078
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

183
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,502
Oh, my dear God.

184
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,457
<i>Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

185
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,252
<i>Walter White,
please pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

186
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,891
<i>Yo, we working sometime this year?</i>

187
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,687
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

188
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,482
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

189
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,151
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

190
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,196
<i>It's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?</i>

191
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,073
Just put a clock on it for me.

192
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,076
<i>All I'm saying
is we have a schedule, right?</i>

193
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,870
My family comes before your schedule.

194
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,039
<i>Dude, it's not my schedule.</i>

195
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,669
- We have responsibilities here.
<i>- I'll get there when I get there.</i>

196
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,756
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

197
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,759
- You will do no such thing.
<i>- Why not?</i>

198
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,553
<i>Well, for starters</i>

199
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,848
you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

200
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,434
<i>There's gotta be some sort of manual,
right?</i>

201
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,396
- And I can read.
- Jesse, touch nothing.

202
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,854
Stop treating me
like I'm like your assistant.

203
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,568
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

204
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:54,908
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

205
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,244
Thank you very much for your kind words.

206
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,289
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

207
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,417
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

208
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,211
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

209
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,170
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

210
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,355
Hey, tell your douche bag brother-in-law

211
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,509
to head towards the light.

212
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,015
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

213
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,978
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

214
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,998
You know,
these eggs are really not too bad.

215
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,972
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

216
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,309
At what? This. These spots.

217
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,187
This fork is absolutely filthy.

218
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,778
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

219
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,281
Marie, those are just water spots.

220
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,532
That's fine.

221
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,160
Those are not "water spots."

222
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,329
It's dirt.

223
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,832
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

224
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,669
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

225
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,130
God knows what.

226
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,134
Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.

227
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,346
Ours at home aren't any better.

228
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,390
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

229
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,727
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

230
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,479
Well, I'm not actually sure

231
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,525
if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

232
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,861
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

233
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,670
Do you think that sick people

234
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,532
aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

235
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,828
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

236
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,374
Marie...

237
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,837
I survived.

238
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,841
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

239
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,717
Remember that?

240
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,096
Remember how scared we all were?

241
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,935
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

242
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,355
All that week, all I could think of

243
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:35,151
was how they were actually
going to cut me open,

244
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,405
and take out a part of me

245
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,741
that was with me my entire life.

246
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,244
I couldn't get that image out of my head.

247
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:53,086
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

248
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:58,425
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetize you.

249
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,014
Knowing that you may never wake up again.

250
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:15,108
Actually what I really remember
about that day

251
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,777
is driving to the hospital.

252
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,822
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

253
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,116
Yeah.

254
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:27,120
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central,

255
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,457
and we hit every green light.

256
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:35,837
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

257
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,341
It's just... When does that happen?

258
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:45,972
Just like, bang, bang,
green the entire way.

259
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:50,268
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

260
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:55,815
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend

261
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,152
a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

262
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,533
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

263
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,871
At least I was with my family.

264
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,708
I had that.

265
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,218
Anyway, I survived this place.

266
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,389
And I'm not half the man your husband is.

267
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,500
Yes?

268
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,195
I was gonna ask you the same question.

269
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,594
<i>I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?</i>

270
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,967
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

271
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,898
Someone gave the go-ahead.

272
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,401
<i>Are you accusing me?</i>

273
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,236
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

274
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,449
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

275
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,870
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

276
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,539
<i>- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?</i>
- A week, a month.

277
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,753
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

278
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,161
We lay low,
and then we get the real story

279
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,757
from my man who survived.

280
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,760
Your man is in custody.

281
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,847
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

282
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,766
I'll get him the best lawyer,

283
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,976
<i>and then we'll learn the truth.</i>

284
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,812
Well, keep me apprised.

285
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,026
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine

286
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,410
there's always gonna be cause
for concern,

287
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,365
but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

288
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,118
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

289
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,746
- Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

290
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,791
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

291
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,249
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

292
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,962
How long will that take?

293
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,173
I can't really say. It could be hours.

294
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,676
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

295
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,971
Thank you.

296
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,772
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

297
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,982
Get some rest?

298
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,693
I'm not going anywhere.

299
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,821
Me neither.

300
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,664
Well, is anyone else
dying to brush their teeth,

301
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,541
or is it just me?

302
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,109
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

303
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,798
Marie? I could swing by your place.

304
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,176
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

305
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,555
Okay.

306
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,654
Walt. Walt.

307
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,866
We just heard he came through.

308
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:36,494
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

309
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,580
- Thank God. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

310
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,958
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

311
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,252
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

312
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,006
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

313
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,425
God knows, there's a million of them.

314
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,555
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

315
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,266
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

316
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,269
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

317
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,104
Your tax dollars at work.

318
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,905
You ought to see what Hank did
to that bastard.

319
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,985
Wanna see?

320
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,820
Come on, let me show you.

321
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,719
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

322
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,364
- You got him?
- Come on.

323
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:40,034
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

324
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,568
Come here.

325
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
No.

326
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,077
Oh, shit.

327
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,795
Yeah.

328
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,017
Finally. About damn time.

329
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,949
Why isn't there anything cooking?

330
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,176
<i>Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

331
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,638
<i>- Operator.</i>
- This is Walter White.

332
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,557
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

333
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,646
<i>Yo, we got problems, big ones.</i>

334
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,525
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

335
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,110
Turn your phone on already.

336
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,322
<i>You know,
I will definitely look into that.</i>

337
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,367
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

338
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,036
Okay?

339
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,374
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

340
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,501
<i>Yeah, dick, I was waiting,</i>

341
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,463
<i>and then that creepy, quiet guy
showed up.</i>

342
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,341
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

343
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,843
Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.

344
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,679
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

345
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,488
He started asking questions too.

346
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,560
<i>Like why haven't we cooked anything.
All right, we have a quota.</i>

347
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,356
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

348
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>Because that guy,
he's got, like, the dead eyes.</i>

349
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,860
Let me ask you something.

350
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,869
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

351
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,200
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

352
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,161
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

353
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,830
No. He kept... He kept saying

354
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,668
that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

355
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,379
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

356
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,925
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

357
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,721
His cousins.

358
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,183
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

359
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,894
Yeah, cousins.

360
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,646
Whatever, man. Why?

361
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,208
Any news?

362
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,252
No change.

363
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:08,051
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose,

364
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,263
so I just stopped by the drugstore.

365
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,765
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

366
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,475
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

367
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,603
Yeah.

368
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh, I think I'm gonna go wash my face.

369
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm going crazy.

370
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,658
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

371
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,460
<i>Nurse Franklin, please page the operator.</i>

372
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,212
<i>Nurse Franklin, page the operator.</i>

373
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,218
I got candy bars.

374
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,516
Is this what you were asking for?

375
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,769
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

376
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,189
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

377
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,816
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

378
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,153
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

379
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,326
Well, what's it about?

380
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,833
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

381
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,003
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

382
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,217
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him,

383
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,844
and tried to bring him down.

384
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,056
Some of them were DEA, you know?

385
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,394
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about

386
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,648
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

387
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,568
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

388
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,656
I guess I never thought about it.

389
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:02,659
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

390
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,760
So he gave it to me.

391
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,596
Figured I'd read it.

392
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,529
I need to...

393
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,698
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

394
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,917
{\an8}No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

395
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,754
<i>So I can expect delivery by tomorrow
as scheduled.</i>

396
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,965
Well...

397
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,426
Unfortunately...

398
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,303
<i>Unfortunately</i>

399
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,640
we're not going to be able
to keep our schedule this week.

400
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,059
But not for lack of trying.

401
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,270
Is there something I should know?

402
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,316
Well, to be completely honest with you

403
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,611
Gale really screwed us up.

404
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,781
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... He set us way back.

405
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,784
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

406
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,290
And I've had to be out running errands,

407
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,834
<i>and trying to keep us on target.</i>

408
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,297
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

409
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,467
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

410
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,762
But rest assured that...

411
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,264
That we will do whatever it takes.

412
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,642
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

413
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,061
<i>We'll cook through the weekend
if necessary.</i>

414
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,274
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

415
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,488
I have your word on that?

416
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,200
You do. You have my word on that.

417
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,870
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

418
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,228
Yeah. Right.

419
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,107
Any news?

420
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:36,236
No, I'm just wandering.

421
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,700
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be expected.

422
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,911
It's this not knowing

423
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,580
that's the hardest part, I think.

424
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,376
Anything new on these guys?

425
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,545
Who they are? What they wanted?

426
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,632
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

427
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,596
Steve...

428
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,435
Do you think there could maybe be others?

429
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,564
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

430
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,066
That was their one shot and they blew it.

431
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,610
So no.

432
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,155
No way.

433
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,949
Jesus.

434
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,661
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

435
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,455
Me too.

436
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,423
Yeah?

437
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,175
Oh, yeah?

438
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,886
Great. We'll be right down.

439
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,304
Food's here.

440
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,431
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

441
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,267
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

442
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,110
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

443
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,608
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

444
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,320
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

445
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,490
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

446
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,016
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

447
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,838
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

448
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,966
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

449
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,510
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

450
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,346
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward

451
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,557
on any information about the case.

452
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,519
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

453
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,688
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

454
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,524
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband

455
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,527
are the thin blue line
between us and these animals.

456
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,136
I only wish I could do more.

457
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,870
Well, we do appreciate your support.

458
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:54,541
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

459
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,587
Again, I can't express how sorry I am.

460
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,089
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

461
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:06,261
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

462
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,473
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

463
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:13,185
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

464
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:18,315
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

465
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,944
Really?

466
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,573
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

467
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,493
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

468
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,788
I hope that there's been good news.

469
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,793
Things have improved, yes.

470
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,212
That's wonderful to hear.

471
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,799
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

472
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,930
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

473
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,811
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

474
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,063
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

475
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:03,443
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

476
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,947
It's amazing.

477
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:12,077
You know, I didn't say thank you.

478
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,163
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

479
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,752
Good to see you.
Enjoy the chicken?

480
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,589
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

481
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,134
My pleasure. My pleasure.

482
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,885
Thank you. Thank you.

483
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,994
- It's good chicken, huh? Good.
- Yeah.

484
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,265
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

485
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,768
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

486
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:41,064
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

487
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,154
You knew.

488
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,991
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

489
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,369
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

490
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,164
What careful man wouldn't?

491
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:02,294
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

492
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,508
Your being here is...

493
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,970
Is this some sort of message?

494
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,473
I'm supporting my community.

495
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,392
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

496
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,311
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

497
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,898
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

498
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,025
I don't know what it means.

499
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,279
Please, if you have some knowledge

500
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,698
that you could share with me...

501
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,538
I fear for my family.

502
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,123
I'm sure they'll be fine.

503
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,002
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

504
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,380
It's doubtful he'll live.

505
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:52,552
Now thank me and shake my hand.

506
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,894
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

507
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,232
Did you hear that?

508
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,571
- We're going up?
- Come on.

509
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,699
What's going on?

510
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,243
What's happening?

511
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:20,080
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

512
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,040
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

513
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:25,168
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

514
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,212
One, two, three, four.

515
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,921
- Give me a liter of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

516
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,508
One, two, three, four.

517
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:34,886
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

518
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,347
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

519
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:39,599
Time of death, 20:43.

520
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,771
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

521
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,424
Yes? Juan?

522
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,301
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

523
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,137
Your man died. I heard.

524
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,931
- It's unfortunate.
<i>- Yeah, unfortunate.</i>

525
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,934
And meanwhile, I have Federales
surrounding my house.

526
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:26,855
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

527
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:29,274
Why would I do this?

528
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:32,777
- How would it serve me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

529
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,030
Go off on your own, maybe.

530
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,281
Would you actually think that would work?

531
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,118
<i>Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

532
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,413
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

533
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,081
I see things clear enough.

534
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,794
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

535
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,129
D.F. suddenly has to put
on a big show,

536
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:54,049
<i>and I wind up with Federales
in my rosebushes.</i>

537
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,967
<i>But just for a while.</i>

538
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:00,180
Appearances, politics.

539
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,307
<i>Are you still there, Gustavo?</i>

540
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,184
Yes.

541
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,644
I'm here.

542
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,313
<i>I'll weather this. I always do.</i>

543
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:09,981
My brother's a police chief.

544
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,818
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

545
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,153
And when I get proof,

546
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:18,198
and the others find out what you've done

547
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,368
maybe we come pay you a visit.

548
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,411
<i>Maybe we can...</i>

549
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:15,255
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

550
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,174
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

551
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,720
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

552
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,347
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

553
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,516
- We're all family.
- I understand.

554
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,686
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

555
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,355
We're all family.
