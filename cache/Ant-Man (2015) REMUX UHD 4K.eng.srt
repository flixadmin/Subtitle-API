1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,265
Stark!

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,876
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,345
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,646
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,504
I took a detour...

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,708
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,757
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

8
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,886
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,244
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:42,841
You were instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:44,918
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,122
I am a scientist.

13
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,846
Then act like one.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,516
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,157
Help us put it to good use.
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

16
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,159
and now you try to steal my research?

17
00:00:56,183 --> 00:01:00,584
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,268
Easy, Hank.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,247
You mention my wife again

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,364
and I will show you ferocity.

21
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,064
Don't look at me. You said it.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,437
I formally tender my resignation.

23
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,837
We don't accept it. Formally.

24
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,202
Hank,

25
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,005
we need you.

26
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:26,397
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

27
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,797
Don't let your past determine the future.

28
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,800
As long as I am alive,

29
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:35,382
nobody will ever get that formula.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,038
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

31
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,323
You have already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

32
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,921
Yes.

33
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:51,000
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

34
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,164
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

35
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,140
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,406
I have known Hank Pym for a long time.

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,990
He's no security risk.

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,904
Unless we make him one.

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,906
You like that?

40
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,362
You like that?

41
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,905
Come get you some now.

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,666
You didn't even move.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,197
Nah.

44
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:04,981
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here. You see this right here?

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,886
I am going to miss you, Scott.

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,823
I am going to miss you, too, Peachy.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,637
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

48
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,684
All right, break it up.

49
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,101
Break it up! Break it up!

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,482
Scotty!

51
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,285
What's up, man!

52
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,227
Damn! Hey.
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

53
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,361
Hey, what's up with your eye?

54
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,519
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

55
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,485
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

56
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,548
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

57
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,722
You know what? I am still the only one
who knocked him out.

58
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,982
Well, I definitely didn't.

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,041
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

60
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:09,596
Bro, you think I am going to miss
my celly getting out?

61
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,007
Hey, how's your girl, man?

62
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,261
Oh, she left me.

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,191
Yeah, my ma died, too.

64
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,505
And my dad got deported.

65
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,117
But I got the van!

66
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,745
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,636
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

68
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,963
You wait till you see this couch.
You're going to be really happy.

69
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,526
You're going to be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

70
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,041
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,722
And I got to introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

72
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,446
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

73
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,861
No, I am serious, man.
I am not going back.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,400
I got a daughter to take care of.

75
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,683
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

76
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:45,704
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,621
I am going to be fine.

78
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,236
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

79
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,318
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

80
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,421
Uh, no, thanks.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,925
Um, I will have...
I will have a burger, please.

82
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,567
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

83
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:04,560
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

84
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,549
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,067
I will just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

86
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,717
Dude.

87
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,605
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

88
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,304
Sure thing, Dale.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,150
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

90
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,109
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,866
Pull up some chair.

92
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,518
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

93
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,802
You found out.

94
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:34,117
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

95
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,587
Look, I am sorry, all right?
But I...

96
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,282
No one would hire me.

97
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,802
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

98
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:45,701
Look, I am sorry. I can always...
I don't do it anymore. I just... Respect.

99
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,957
I couldn't be happier about it.

100
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,556
- Really? Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

101
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,127
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

102
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,776
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

103
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,478
I am like, "Wow, I know this guy?
"I am in charge of this guy?"

104
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:04,023
Well, I am very happy in this job, and...

105
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,865
I really just appreciate the opportunity to...
Yeah, yeah. Well, you're fired, of course.

106
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,400
I can't really keep you on.
Wait, what? Fired?

107
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,557
Yeah.

108
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,638
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I am a good worker.

109
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:19,600
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

110
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,002
I will tell you what, though.

111
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:24,239
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

112
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:27,320
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

113
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,727
on your way out the door,

114
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,266
I will just pretend I didn't see it.

115
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,151
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

116
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,405
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

117
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,319
I was. I got fired.

118
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,125
Damn. They find out who you are?

119
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:18,243
Yeah.

120
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:20,045
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

121
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,039
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

122
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:25,365
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I will take a waffle.

123
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,887
Oh. That's Kurt.

124
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,300
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

125
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,661
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

126
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,587
Who are you?

127
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,021
Dave.

128
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,910
Nice work on the Vista job.

129
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,122
Vista job, yes.

130
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:43,676
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,124
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

132
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,927
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I am a cat burglar.

133
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,441
You mean you're a pussy.

134
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:52,597
Yeah.

135
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,519
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

136
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,041
And it added up to millions.

137
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,029
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

138
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,842
And what does he do?

139
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,839
He hacks into the security system

140
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:04,601
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

141
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,599
Posts all the bank records online.

142
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,860
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

143
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,349
What are you doing?

144
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,517
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

145
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,882
What do you want?

146
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:22,437
Okay.
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

147
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,803
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

148
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,277
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

149
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,356
No!

150
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,717
I am finished, man.
I am not going back to jail.

151
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,844
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

152
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,884
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

153
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,062
I don't care. I am out.

154
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,127
Dr. Pym?

155
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,621
Yes. I am still alive.

156
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,747
ID?

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,268
Perhaps that will suffice.

158
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,502
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

159
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,788
Is that Hank Pym?

160
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,146
Good morning, Hank.

161
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,397
Hope.

162
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,980
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

163
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,824
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

164
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,308
More like "thrilled."

165
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,876
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

166
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,367
What's the occasion?

167
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,749
Oh, you will see. Won't he, Hope?

168
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,544
We're ready for you inside.

169
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,243
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

170
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,024
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

171
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,982
You're in for a treat.

172
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,425
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

173
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,664
How's your face?

174
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,469
After you.

175
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,245
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

176
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,707
This company's founder and my mentor,

177
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,381
Dr. Hank Pym.

178
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,964
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

179
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,277
I immediately started
researching a particle

180
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,121
that could change
the distance between atoms,

181
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:57,064
while increasing density and strength.

182
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,599
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

183
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:04,965
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

184
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:06,959
But just imagine,

185
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:11,304
a soldier the size of an insect.

186
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,310
The ultimate secret weapon.

187
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,302
An Ant-Man.

188
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,128
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

189
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,401
Silly, I know.

190
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,990
Propaganda.

191
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,149
Tales to astonish!

192
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,564
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

193
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,482
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

194
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:54,107
every single time I asked you,

195
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,156
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

196
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,886
Just a tall tale.

197
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,003
Right.

198
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:04,183
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

199
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,203
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

200
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:21,120
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

201
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:24,269
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

202
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,744
Could that be done?

203
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,551
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

204
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,900
Distinguished guests,

205
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,036
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

206
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,949
The Yellowjacket!

207
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,042
Oh, no.

208
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:51,462
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

209
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,527
capable of altering the size of the wearer

210
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,702
for the ultimate combat advantage.

211
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,767
We live in an era

212
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,077
in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves

213
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:04,239
are undermined
by constant surveillance.

214
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,069
It's time to return to a simpler age.

215
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,964
One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly

216
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,346
to protect their interests.

217
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,238
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

218
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:16,683
The Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict

219
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,121
on the geopolitical landscape

220
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,278
completely unseen.

221
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:24,305
Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.

222
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,602
Practical applications
include surveillance,

223
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,384
industrial sabotage,

224
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,559
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.

225
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,876
A single Yellowjacket

226
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,101
offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.

227
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,287
And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets

228
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:48,567
will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.

229
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:50,549
The Yellowjacket.

230
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,990
So, it's a suit?

231
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,125
Don't be crude, Frank.

232
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,349
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

233
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,287
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

234
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:06,246
No, I am impressed. I am also concerned.

235
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,286
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

236
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,967
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

237
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,824
I really value your opinion.

238
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,344
Thank you for coming. Hope?

239
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,767
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

240
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,986
Thank you.

241
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,801
You seem a bit shocked.

242
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:30,165
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

243
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,262
So you finally admit it!

244
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,547
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

245
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,346
That's why you're the past
and I am the future. Don't do this.

246
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,584
Dr. Cross?

247
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,561
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

248
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,525
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

249
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,826
Deal.

250
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,683
We have to make our move, Hank.

251
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:05,561
How close is he?
He still can't shrink a live subject.

252
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:08,207
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

253
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,301
No.

254
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,405
I have Cross' complete trust.

255
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,662
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

256
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,302
Well, that's not entirely true.

257
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,143
I think I found a guy.

258
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,985
Who?

259
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,766
Daddy!

260
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,326
Peanut! Oh!

261
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,598
Happy birthday!

262
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:33,677
I am so sorry I am late.

263
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,360
I didn't know
what time your party started.

264
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:36,926
It was on the invitation.

265
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,760
He didn't get an invitation.

266
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,361
But he came anyway!

267
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,406
Well, I am not going to miss
my little girl's birthday party.

268
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,240
I am going to go tell Mommy you're here.

269
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:46,317
Oh, you don't...

270
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,397
What are you doing here, Lang?

271
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,001
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

272
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,760
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

273
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,917
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

274
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,342
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

275
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,567
Hey, look what I have for you.

276
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,047
Can I open it now?

277
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,869
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

278
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,806
You're my bestest friend.

279
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,037
What is that thing?

280
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,869
He's so ugly!

281
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,398
I love him!

282
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,001
Can I go show my friends?

283
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,023
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

284
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,316
You're my bestest friend.

285
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,596
Look, the child support is coming, all right? It's
just hard finding a job when you have a record.

286
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,536
I am sure you will figure it out. But for
now, I want you out of my house. No way! Okay.

287
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,660
It's my daughter's birthday. It's my house!
So what? Scott! It's my kid!

288
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,003
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

289
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,123
It's a birthday party.

290
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,880
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

291
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:37,957
She's my daughter.

292
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,447
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

293
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,601
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

294
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,639
Your fiancé is an asshat.

295
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:46,776
He's not an asshat.

296
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,766
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

297
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,225
Stop it.

298
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,524
Really, Maggie? That guy?

299
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,200
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

300
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,641
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

301
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:59,390
At least he's not a crook.

302
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,960
I am trying, okay? I have changed.
I am straight.

303
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,427
I had a job and...

304
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,963
I want to provide.

305
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,602
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

306
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:12,677
So much.

307
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:16,078
I have missed so much time
and I want to be a part of her life.

308
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,181
What do I do?

309
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,266
Get an apartment,

310
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,202
get a job, pay child support.

311
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:25,509
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

312
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,028
You're her hero, Scott.

313
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,190
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

314
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,790
I am sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

315
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,364
Yeah. Well, uh...

316
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:06,943
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

317
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,224
It'd be nice though, right?

318
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,707
But there are laws.

319
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,801
What laws? Of man?

320
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,322
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

321
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,582
And I have transcended the laws of nature.

322
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,943
Darren, I don't think you understand...

323
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,500
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

324
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,071
Goodbye, Frank.

325
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,224
Thank you.

326
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,081
You know, I have been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

327
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,523
And today,
during my morning meditation,

328
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:07,520
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

329
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:08,882
How's that?

330
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,789
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

331
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,763
I have spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

332
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,442
I devoted my genius to him.

333
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,383
I could have worked anywhere.

334
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,710
I chose my mentor poorly.

335
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,349
You didn't even have a choice.

336
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,347
He never believed in you.

337
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,982
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

338
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,384
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

339
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,006
Because his failures as a mentor,

340
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,228
as a father,

341
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,903
forced us to spread our wings.

342
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,662
You're a success, Darren.

343
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,821
You deserve everything
coming your way.

344
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:17,790
Stop cheating.

345
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,110
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

346
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,319
Maybe he didn't hear you.

347
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,461
How was the party?

348
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,756
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

349
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,804
I want to know about that tip.

350
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:39,376
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.
Calm down, all right?

351
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,997
I just need to know where it came from.

352
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,386
It's got to be airtight.

353
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,237
Okay.

354
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,557
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

355
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,977
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

356
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,356
You know, but there was a rosé
that saved the day. It was delightful.

357
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,042
And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

358
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,323
It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.

359
00:20:56,347 --> 00:21:00,781
It's the wrong details.
It has nothing to do with the story. Go.

360
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,037
So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a housekeeper now, right?

361
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,438
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.

362
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:11,599
And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.

363
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:14,043
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO.

364
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,198
That is all retired now, but he's loaded.

365
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:19,997
And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,

366
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,796
and they get to talking, right?

367
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,243
And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.

368
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:29,401
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."

369
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,956
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

370
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,037
Of course, I ask him...

371
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:36,438
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"

372
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,756
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

373
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,302
"All she said is that it's like super-legit
and whatever's in it, it's got to be good."

374
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,317
What?

375
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:48,836
Old man have safe.

376
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,038
And he's gone for a week.

377
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,084
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

378
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,282
and he's gone for a week.

379
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,437
Let's just work with that.

380
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,985
You know what I am saying?

381
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,966
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

382
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,323
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

383
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:52,397
Comm check.

384
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,636
- Check.
- Check.

385
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,196
Hey, if the job goes bad, you know
I got your back, right? Don't worry.

386
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,507
It's not going to happen.

387
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,744
I love it when he gets cocky.

388
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,861
Damn!

389
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,637
Alarm is dead.

390
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:40,827
Nice.

391
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,461
All right,
I am moving through the house.

392
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,525
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

393
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,202
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

394
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:17,358
Aw, man, are we screwed?

395
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:19,383
Not necessarily.

396
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,437
I am in.

397
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:11,749
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

398
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,320
Oh, man.

399
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:18,791
What is it?

400
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,127
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

401
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,437
How serious
are we talking, Scotty?

402
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:26,200
It's a Carbondale.

403
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,687
It's from 1910.

404
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:30,521
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

405
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:31,836
Wow.

406
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,327
Can you crack it?

407
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,798
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

408
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:38,202
Remember what that iceberg did?

409
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,005
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

410
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,077
Killed everybody.

411
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,681
Did not kill the Old lady.

412
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,982
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

413
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,726
What are you doing?

414
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,460
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

415
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,341
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

416
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,822
- What are you doing now?
- Waiting.

417
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,421
Waiting.

418
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,661
Nice.

419
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,550
What is it? Cash? Jewels?

420
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,663
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

421
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,489
- It's a suit.
- What?

422
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,709
It's an old motorcycle suit.

423
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,605
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

424
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,145
"No".

425
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,997
It's a bust.

426
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,562
I am really sorry, Scotty.

427
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:24,424
I know you needed to score.

428
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,551
I thought we were using mice.

429
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,541
What's the difference?

430
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,757
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

431
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:10,716
Darren, maybe we should think...

432
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,196
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

433
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,302
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

434
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,040
Experiment 34-C results,

435
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:45,187
negative.

436
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,141
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

437
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,950
Why would you lock this up?

438
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,901
This is so weird.

439
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,271
Scotty, what's up, man?

440
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,907
I wonder... What is this?

441
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,926
The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

442
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,301
What? Who said that?

443
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,629
Luis. Luis, down here!

444
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,037
It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case...

445
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:00,487
...water.

446
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,947
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

447
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,105
Oh, I don't want to see this!

448
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,020
Luis!

449
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,987
Son of a...

450
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,511
What the hell?

451
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,036
Not bad for a test drive.

452
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,788
Keep the suit. I will be in touch.
No! No! No, thank you!

453
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,644
Get down on the ground!

454
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,006
You are under arrest!

455
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,985
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

456
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,070
Don't move.

457
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,322
You know,
you almost had us convinced

458
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,548
that you were going to change your ways.

459
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,262
They were really rooting for you.

460
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,902
It's going to break their hearts.

461
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,061
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

462
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,501
Your lawyer.

463
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,631
My lawyer?

464
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,186
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

465
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,666
I am starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

466
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,186
Oh, man.
Sit down.

467
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,840
Sir, I am sorry I stole the suit.

468
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,805
I don't even want to know
why you have it.

469
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:15,868
Maggie was right about you.

470
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,580
How do you know about... No wonder
she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

471
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,065
The moment things get hard,
you turn right back to crime.

472
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,718
The way I see it, you have a choice.

473
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:32,471
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

474
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,143
or go back to your cell

475
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,196
and await further instructions.

476
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,687
I don't understand.

477
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,918
No, I don't expect you to.

478
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:45,045
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

479
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:46,471
neither do I.

480
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,202
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

481
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,461
What?

482
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,919
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

483
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:09,045
So, next time you think
you might see one,

484
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:13,623
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

485
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,843
You're my bestest friend!

486
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,956
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

487
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,943
No, I love this one.

488
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,271
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

489
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,287
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

490
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:39,701
Is Daddy a bad man?

491
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,144
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

492
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,226
No.

493
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,149
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

494
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,584
Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.

495
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,621
Under the door.

496
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,316
Okay, where to now?

497
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,922
- Hang tight.
- Oh, God.

498
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,237
What, what?

499
00:36:58,261 --> 00:36:59,317
Where the hell did he go?

500
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,682
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

501
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:02,724
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

502
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:06,932
Get back! Get back!
Scott, these are my associates.

503
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,606
Is that a camera on an ant?

504
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,565
Yeah, sure. Why not?

505
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:11,637
Where's the car?

506
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,366
No car. We have got wings.

507
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,746
Incoming!

508
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,685
Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.

509
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:30,389
- Are you kidding. How safe is...
- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

510
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,363
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

511
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:48,877
So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.

512
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:52,644
- All right. Now, what's the next move?
- Hang on tight.

513
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,480
Oh, this is easy!
I am getting the hang of this.

514
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,206
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

515
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,324
You're throwing 247 off balance.

516
00:37:58,348 --> 00:37:59,807
Wait, his name is 247?

517
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,640
He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.

518
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:04,266
Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?

519
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:09,561
Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

520
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,938
- No, I think it's 247.
- Wait.

521
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:13,566
Hang on tight!

522
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,604
I think
I am getting the hang of this.

523
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:18,560
I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.

524
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,676
What?

525
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,629
- Can I make one little request?
- No.

526
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,023
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

527
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,957
Time out.

528
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:28,117
All right, hold on.

529
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,109
Just wait! Whoa!

530
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,326
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

531
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,764
It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.

532
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,440
Let's set her down, all right?

533
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:38,517
I am getting light-headed.

534
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,701
Hang on, Scott.

535
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,343
I am getting a little light...
I need a snooze button.

536
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,227
Hit me in 5 minutes.

537
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,060
Hello.

538
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,661
Who are you?

539
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,481
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

540
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:17,637
Yes.

541
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,901
Why?

542
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,900
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

543
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,741
Hey, look...

544
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,005
Paraponera clavata.

545
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,566
Giant tropical bullet ants,

546
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,436
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

547
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,340
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

548
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,065
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

549
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,661
Who?

550
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,997
Hey!

551
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:51,785
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

552
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,103
How am I supposed to do this?

553
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,423
All right, just one step at a time.

554
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,703
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

555
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,797
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

556
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,082
We don't need this guy.

557
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,636
I assume that you have already
met my daughter, Hope.

558
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,287
I did. She's great.

559
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:33,597
She doesn't think that we need you.

560
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:35,076
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

561
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,359
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

562
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:41,007
and then Hope has you arrested.

563
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:44,080
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I will do it myself.

564
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,824
She's a little bit anxious.

565
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,801
It has to do with this job,

566
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:50,402
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

567
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:52,717
I take it that you're interested in.

568
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,922
What job?

569
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,181
Would you like some tea?

570
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,405
Uh... Sure.

571
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:01,990
I was very impressed with how you
managed to get past my security system.

572
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,200
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

573
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:07,721
Were you watching me?

574
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:11,005
Scott, I have been
watching you for a while.

575
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:13,501
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

576
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,720
Oh! Excuse me.

577
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,788
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

578
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,367
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

579
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:26,165
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

580
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,159
But you beat it.

581
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:29,567
Would you like some sugar?

582
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,230
Yeah, thanks.

583
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,380
You know what?
I am okay.

584
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,478
How do you make them do that?

585
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,207
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

586
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:49,917
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

587
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,182
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

588
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,749
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

589
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,805
I speak to them.

590
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,277
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

591
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,767
and see everything.

592
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,749
And still know absolutely nothing.

593
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,787
I am late to meet Cross.

594
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,381
Uh... Dr. Pym?
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

595
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,567
Sorry, I just have one question.

596
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,764
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

597
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,486
and can I go back to jail now?

598
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,991
Come with me.

599
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,750
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

600
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:35,317
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

601
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:37,125
That's what powers the suit.

602
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:38,904
That's why it works.

603
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,101
Wow.

604
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,104
But it was dangerous.

605
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,862
It was too dangerous.

606
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,068
So I hid it from the world.

607
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,870
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

608
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,837
Pym Tech.

609
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:01,106
Yes.

610
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,836
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

611
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,156
Darren Cross.

612
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,283
He's a big deal.

613
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:10,836
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

614
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,240
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

615
00:43:15,264 --> 00:43:17,637
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

616
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,277
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

617
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:25,037
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

618
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,349
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

619
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,883
But I wouldn't help him.

620
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,802
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

621
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:35,401
How could he do that?

622
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:38,286
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

623
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,711
She was the deciding vote.

624
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,748
But she came back to me when she saw how
close Cross was to cracking my formula.

625
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,037
The process is highly volatile.

626
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,960
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

627
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:55,950
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

628
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,904
I don't think Darren realizes this, and, you
know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

629
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,742
So, what do you want from me?

630
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,482
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

631
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:11,557
Do you?

632
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:13,105
I do.

633
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,246
If you can help me,

634
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,061
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

635
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,467
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

636
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,117
Absolutely.

637
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:27,986
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

638
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,401
What do you want me to do?

639
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:33,902
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

640
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,500
Are you going to be home
for dinner tonight?

641
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,597
Uh, yeah. I will pick something up.
Text me.

642
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:43,986
Okay. Good news?

643
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,478
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

644
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:49,106
Are you trying to find my daddy?

645
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,749
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

646
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,441
I just want your daddy to be safe.

647
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:57,668
Hope you don't catch him.

648
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,446
This isn't the first time these guys

649
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,326
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

650
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,446
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

651
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,907
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

652
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,325
He always wanted my tech.

653
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:00,718
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

654
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:02,948
and destroy all the data,

655
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,990
Darren Cross is going to unleash chaos
upon the world.

656
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,465
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

657
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,520
I spent half my life

658
00:46:18,544 --> 00:46:21,759
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

659
00:46:21,783 --> 00:46:25,602
I am sure as hell not going to
hand-deliver it to one now.

660
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:29,078
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

661
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:31,706
This could change the texture of reality.

662
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,710
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

663
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,263
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

664
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,044
Scott, they are ants.

665
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:47,065
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

666
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,963
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

667
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:56,643
Hank, I am a thief, all right? I mean,
I am a good thief, but this is insane.

668
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:58,798
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

669
00:46:58,822 --> 00:47:01,506
You have seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

670
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,644
I was against using him
when we had months, and now we have days.

671
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,717
I am wearing the suit.

672
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,207
Absolutely not!

673
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:11,200
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

674
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:13,875
I know this mission better than anybody
here. We need you close to Cross.

675
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:15,601
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

676
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,926
We don't have time to screw around! Hope, please
listen to me... He is a criminal! I am your daughter.

677
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,191
No!

678
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,320
She's right, Hank.

679
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:03,104
I am not your guy.

680
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,997
Why don't you wear the suit?

681
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:08,283
You think I don't want to?

682
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:09,620
I can't.

683
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,103
I spent years wearing it,

684
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,947
and it took a toll on me.

685
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,671
You're our only option.

686
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,960
Before Hope lost her mother,

687
00:48:32,984 --> 00:48:36,985
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

688
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,148
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

689
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,462
It's too late for me,

690
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,405
but not for you.

691
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,439
This is your chance.

692
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:56,123
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

693
00:48:56,147 --> 00:49:00,111
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

694
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,346
It's not about saving our world.

695
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,030
It's about saving theirs.

696
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,823
Damn. That was a good speech.

697
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,501
Scott,

698
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,340
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

699
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,762
In the right hands,

700
00:49:22,786 --> 00:49:26,124
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

701
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:29,962
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

702
00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:32,880
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

703
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:34,162
you need to be fast.

704
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:36,159
You should be able to shrink and grow

705
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:41,382
on a dime.
So your size always suits your needs.

706
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,285
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

707
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:48,351
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

708
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,386
Useless.

709
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,121
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

710
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,119
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

711
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:06,484
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

712
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,924
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

713
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:11,441
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

714
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:13,320
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

715
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,125
Show me.

716
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:16,989
- Terrible.
- You want to show me how to punch?

717
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,581
Show me...

718
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,760
That's how you punch.

719
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:24,601
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

720
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,327
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

721
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:29,516
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

722
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,604
We lost her in a plane crash.

723
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,405
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

724
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,046
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

725
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,904
We're working, here.

726
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,220
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

727
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,821
Were you going for the hand?

728
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,001
You know, I think this regulator is holding
me back. Do not screw with the regulator.

729
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:57,840
If that regulator is compromised,

730
00:50:57,864 --> 00:50:59,486
you would go subatomic.

731
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,945
What does that mean?

732
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,158
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

733
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:10,284
What does that mean? It means that you would enter
a reality where all concepts of time and space

734
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:11,403
become irrelevant

735
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:14,344
as you shrink for all eternity.

736
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,647
Everything that you know

737
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:19,071
and love,

738
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,550
gone forever.

739
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,758
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

740
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,167
You have learned about the suit,

741
00:51:27,191 --> 00:51:29,991
but you have yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

742
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,347
the ants.

743
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,202
Loyal, brave,

744
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:36,109
and your partners on this job.

745
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,040
Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

746
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:47,196
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

747
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,842
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

748
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:51,624
You're not so crazy.

749
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,998
"Hey..."

750
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:55,426
You're cute.

751
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,028
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

752
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,042
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

753
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,039
There's a security guard posted
around the clock.

754
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:23,722
We will need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

755
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:26,391
Okay, who's next?

756
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,727
Paraponera clavata.

757
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:33,086
I know. Bullet ants, right?
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

758
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,529
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

759
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,756
The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed.

760
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,961
And the only access point is a tube we
estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.

761
00:52:43,985 --> 00:52:45,879
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

762
00:52:45,903 --> 00:52:50,000
The tube is protected by a laser grid, and
we can only power that down for 15 seconds.

763
00:52:50,024 --> 00:52:52,682
You're going to need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

764
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:56,841
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

765
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:59,102
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

766
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,356
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

767
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,206
Ideal for ground and air transport.

768
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,384
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

769
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,557
I am going to call him "Ant-thony."

770
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:10,876
That's good. That's very good.

771
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,598
Because this time, you're really going to
have to learn how to control him.

772
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:18,431
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

773
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,166
Aw! You okay?
Did I hurt...

774
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,876
Hank wants you outside for target practice. The
suit has no weapons, so I made you these discs.

775
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,340
Red shrinks.

776
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,950
Blue enlarges.

777
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,376
Solenopsis mandibularis.

778
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,596
Known for their bite, the fire ants
have evolved into remarkable architects.

779
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,823
They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.

780
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,144
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

781
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,838
They're not listening to me.

782
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:13,567
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

783
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:15,604
No shortcuts, no lies.

784
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:20,364
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

785
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:21,961
We don't have time for coddling.

786
00:54:21,985 --> 00:54:24,198
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

787
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:25,711
Really?

788
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,464
Is that where our focus should be?

789
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,946
Hope!

790
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,471
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

791
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,587
We can't do this without her.

792
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,844
Oh, God.
You got to lock your doors.

793
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:28,584
I mean, really, there's some weird folks in
this neighborhood. Do you think this is a joke?

794
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,122
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

795
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:33,436
You have a daughter.

796
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,847
I am doing this for her.

797
00:55:34,871 --> 00:55:37,910
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

798
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,637
He was in grief.

799
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,081
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

800
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:43,786
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

801
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,583
He just sent me off to boarding school.

802
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,901
You know, I thought,

803
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,081
with all that's at stake,

804
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:54,319
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

805
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:56,319
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

806
00:55:56,343 --> 00:55:59,286
He doesn't want to shut you out.
He trusts you.

807
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,721
Then why are you here?

808
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:02,822
It proves that he loves you.

809
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,507
Hope. Look at me.

810
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,430
I am expendable.

811
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,505
That's why I am here.

812
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,503
You must have realized that by now.

813
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,587
I mean, it's why I am in the suit
and you're not.

814
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,827
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

815
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,787
Anyway...

816
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,239
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

817
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:31,581
when I called the cops on you.

818
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,781
What's her name?

819
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,110
Cassie.

820
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,624
It's a pretty name.

821
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,840
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

822
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,908
That's how it works.

823
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,447
Think about Cassie.

824
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:56,465
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

825
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,827
Open your eyes and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

826
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,500
That's good!

827
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:57,423
Your mother convinced me
to let her join me on my missions.

828
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,078
They called her the Wasp.

829
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,421
She was born to it.

830
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,628
And there's not a day that goes by

831
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,904
that I don't regret having said yes.

832
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,064
It was 1987.

833
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,343
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

834
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,870
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

835
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,445
The only way to the internal mechanics

836
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:38,463
was through solid titanium.

837
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:52,438
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

838
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,783
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

839
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,921
Your mother,

840
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:00,385
she didn't hesitate.

841
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,144
Janet! No!

842
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,380
She turned off her regulator

843
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,869
and went subatomic

844
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,468
to deactivate the bomb.

845
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,069
And she was gone.

846
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,628
Your mom died a hero.

847
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,597
And I spent the next 10 years

848
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:39,064
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

849
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,748
You were trying to bring her back.

850
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,987
But all I learned was we know nothing.

851
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,823
It's not your fault.

852
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,664
She made her choice.

853
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,802
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

854
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:12,870
I was trying to protect you.

855
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,350
I lost your mother.

856
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,225
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

857
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,425
I am sorry.

858
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,066
This is awesome.

859
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,800
It's awesome, you know?

860
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:32,982
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

861
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,505
It's important.

862
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,886
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

863
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,709
Yes, you did. Yes.

864
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,783
I am going to make some tea.

865
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,501
Nailed it!

866
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,788
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

867
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,519
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

868
01:01:35,543 --> 01:01:36,757
It's freezing!

869
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:39,227
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

870
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,767
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

871
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,567
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

872
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:47,476
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

873
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,709
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

874
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:55,626
It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard
Stark's old storage facilities in upstate New York.

875
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,524
Should be a piece of cake.

876
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:59,479
You're over the target area.

877
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:03,117
Disengage now, Scott!
Squadron A, go!

878
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:04,551
B, go!

879
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,061
C, go!

880
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,551
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

881
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,678
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

882
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:16,827
Stay calm.

883
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,525
Guys?
We might have a problem.

884
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:24,043
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

885
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,487
It's not!

886
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,463
You son of a bitch!

887
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,645
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

888
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:33,797
Abort now!

889
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:36,607
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

890
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,788
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

891
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,717
He's going to lose the suit.

892
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:42,310
He's going to lose his life.

893
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,268
All right, I am on the roof
of the target building.

894
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,990
Somebody's home, Scott.

895
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,666
What's going on down there, Sam?
It's the Falcon!

896
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,468
I had a sensor trip
but I am not seeing anything.

897
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,997
Wait a second.

898
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:05,084
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

899
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:06,681
It's okay. He can't see me.

900
01:03:06,705 --> 01:03:07,803
I can see you.

901
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,061
He can see me.

902
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,319
Hi. I am Scott.

903
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:15,046
Did he just say, "Hi, I am Scott"?

904
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,404
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I am a big fan.

905
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,150
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

906
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,117
I am Ant-Man.

907
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:23,436
"Ant-Man"?

908
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,638
What? You haven't heard of me?

909
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:27,504
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

910
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,321
You want to tell me what you want?

911
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:31,837
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

912
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:33,645
Just for a few days. I
am going to return it.

913
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:36,367
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

914
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:37,871
I know exactly how that is.

915
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,803
Located the breach.

916
01:03:39,827 --> 01:03:41,380
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

917
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,385
What the hell are you doing?

918
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,060
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

919
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,402
Sorry!

920
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,030
Look, I am sorry about this. Sorry.

921
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,781
That's enough!

922
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,504
Ant-thony! A little help!

923
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,266
I have lost visual.

924
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,756
He's inside my pack!

925
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,907
Sorry!

926
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,820
You seem like a really great guy.

927
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:32,660
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

928
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,467
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

929
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,381
You jeopardized everything!

930
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,944
You got it.

931
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,917
Well done.

932
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:04,996
Wait a minute.

933
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,447
Did you just compliment me?

934
01:06:06,471 --> 01:06:09,020
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

935
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,346
I was good, wasn't I?

936
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,517
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

937
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,076
Let us not dwell on the past.

938
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,308
We got to finish our planning.

939
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,344
Don't mind him.

940
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,861
You did good.

941
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,026
Darren.

942
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,670
How the hell did you get in here?

943
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,141
You left the front door open, Hank.

944
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,517
It's official.

945
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:46,741
You're old.

946
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,461
The plans.

947
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,464
He will kill him.

948
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,385
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

949
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,886
I have good news.

950
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,220
Really?

951
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,061
What's that?

952
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:08,278
Pym Tech, the company you created,

953
01:07:08,302 --> 01:07:12,156
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

954
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:16,026
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

955
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,746
You're welcome.

956
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,580
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

957
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,262
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

958
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,046
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

959
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,426
I will be there.

960
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,945
What did you see in me?

961
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,551
I don't know what you mean.

962
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,042
All those years ago, you picked me.

963
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:03,630
What did you see?

964
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,584
I saw myself.

965
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,581
Then why did you push me away?

966
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,462
Because I saw too much of myself.

967
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,525
He knows. He's baiting you.
We have to call it off.

968
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:30,757
We're all taking risks.

969
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:32,167
What if he saw me here?

970
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,567
He didn't. There's no way.

971
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:36,027
How do you know that?

972
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,762
Darren, hi.

973
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:47,710
Hope, where are you right now?

974
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,360
I am at home. Why?
I just saw Hank.

975
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:53,245
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

976
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:56,877
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

977
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:59,402
We need to start everyone working
around the clock.

978
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,325
Get the assembly line up and running.

979
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:02,682
And I am tripling security.

980
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,758
Full sensors at all entrances

981
01:09:04,782 --> 01:09:08,238
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

982
01:09:08,262 --> 01:09:09,960
Great. Good idea.

983
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:14,384
Thank you, Hope.
I am so lucky to have you on my team.

984
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:21,279
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

985
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:23,324
But he is not onto you.

986
01:09:23,348 --> 01:09:25,763
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

987
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,605
and closing exterior vents.

988
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,623
How are we going to get Scott inside?

989
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,665
The water main.

990
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,679
You can't add security to a water main.

991
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:38,077
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

992
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:39,362
that's how I get in.

993
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:41,643
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

994
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,081
to change the water pressure.

995
01:09:43,105 --> 01:09:45,887
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

996
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:47,505
So we expand our team.

997
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,077
What do we need?

998
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,558
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

999
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:54,479
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1000
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,967
and kill the laser grid,

1001
01:09:55,991 --> 01:10:02,731
and a getaway guy. No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

1002
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,481
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1003
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:08,163
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1004
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:10,149
Because we just robbed you.

1005
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:15,376
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1006
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,602
Two smoothie machines.

1007
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:18,286
Are you sure they can handle this?

1008
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,767
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1009
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:23,443
You will forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1010
01:10:23,467 --> 01:10:27,607
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax
a little bit, man. We know our business.

1011
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:31,561
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we? I let you.

1012
01:10:31,585 --> 01:10:34,924
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1013
01:10:34,948 --> 01:10:38,318
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

1014
01:10:38,342 --> 01:10:40,160
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1015
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:42,716
- I am in the system?
- You're in the system.

1016
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,002
The system?

1017
01:10:44,026 --> 01:10:46,363
Yeah, we're doomed.

1018
01:10:46,387 --> 01:10:47,483
All right.

1019
01:10:47,507 --> 01:10:49,240
There's something
you guys need to see.

1020
01:10:49,264 --> 01:10:51,159
When you get to this corner,

1021
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:54,001
there's going to be three offices
on your left side.

1022
01:10:54,025 --> 01:10:55,431
Damn!

1023
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,807
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1024
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:02,561
Now, look,
this is going to get weird, all right?

1025
01:11:02,585 --> 01:11:05,879
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1026
01:11:05,903 --> 01:11:07,287
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1027
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:09,199
- Really?
- Yeah.

1028
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,461
Good.

1029
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,519
This is the work of gypsies.

1030
01:11:19,543 --> 01:11:21,981
That's witchcraft.
Wow, that's amazing.

1031
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,237
That's like some David Copperfield shit.
That's some kind of wizardry.

1032
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:26,397
This is sorcery!

1033
01:11:26,421 --> 01:11:27,602
How'd you do that, bro?

1034
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:29,968
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1035
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:35,586
Ahhh! Get off! Get off!
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1036
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,247
I gave them each half a Xanax

1037
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:41,922
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1038
01:11:41,946 --> 01:11:44,182
They fell right asleep.

1039
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:49,439
Hey, look, I want to thank you for...
No, please don't.

1040
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:51,962
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1041
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:55,882
I am just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1042
01:11:55,906 --> 01:11:58,976
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1043
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,480
You know, the honest truth is, I actually
went from despising you to almost liking you.

1044
01:12:03,504 --> 01:12:05,309
You really should write poetry.

1045
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,389
Get some sleep, Scott.

1046
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,686
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1047
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:05,360
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1048
01:13:05,384 --> 01:13:06,767
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1049
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:08,281
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1050
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:09,876
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

1051
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,520
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

1052
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:13,803
I am sorry. I am good. I am good.
I am just excited.

1053
01:13:13,827 --> 01:13:16,607
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1054
01:13:16,631 --> 01:13:17,677
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1055
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:22,003
Oh, my Lord. She's not my... You know what? I was
thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1056
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,376
Like a whistling. You know
what I am saying? To like, blend in.

1057
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,308
No. Don't whistle. No whistling. It's
not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

1058
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,346
All clear in Sector One.

1059
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,661
Step out.

1060
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,466
All clear.

1061
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,266
We're set.

1062
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,185
Wish me luck.

1063
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,304
Utilities online.

1064
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,549
Hey! What are you doing?

1065
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,708
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I am securing it.

1066
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,431
I am the boss.

1067
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,690
Utilities 1.3...

1068
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,422
Water level is dropping!

1069
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:32,671
Coming up on extraction pipe.
All right, I see it.

1070
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:44,342
All right, come on, I got to get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes! Yes!

1071
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,989
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1072
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,781
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1073
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,238
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1074
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:12,264
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1075
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,324
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1076
01:16:16,348 --> 01:16:17,602
This is problem?

1077
01:16:17,626 --> 01:16:21,557
Considering the Crown Vic's the most
commonly used car for undercover cops, man...

1078
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:23,451
...yes, this is problem.

1079
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,141
That's Pym.

1080
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,201
Oh, no.

1081
01:16:32,225 --> 01:16:33,516
I am deploying the bullet ants.

1082
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,361
Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...

1083
01:16:35,385 --> 01:16:38,184
I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.

1084
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,026
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

1085
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,237
See? That's what I am talking about.
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1086
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:56,342
in a very serious operation.

1087
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,708
Signal decoy in place.

1088
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,183
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1089
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,683
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1090
01:17:13,707 --> 01:17:15,440
Scott, we have problem.

1091
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,463
Problem? What's the problem?

1092
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,756
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1093
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,486
Listen to me.

1094
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:26,380
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1095
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,749
That's awfully dramatic.

1096
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,906
Are you kidding me?

1097
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,144
Problem solved.

1098
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,266
Well...

1099
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,903
How do I look?

1100
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,481
There he is.

1101
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,983
Just in time. Come on.

1102
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,165
12-point verification.

1103
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:27,176
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1104
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,320
Confirming authorization level.
Well, you can never be too safe.

1105
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:31,940
Access granted.

1106
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,630
Got to hand it to you, Darren.

1107
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,244
You really did it.

1108
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:45,183
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1109
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,030
Arriving in second position.

1110
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,988
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1111
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,266
Proceeding to command position.

1112
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,664
I will be right back, Ant-thony.

1113
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,638
All right, guys. I am in position.

1114
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,400
I am going to signal the ants.

1115
01:19:54,424 --> 01:19:56,987
No, no, no, no, no!

1116
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,226
Did you see that?

1117
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,246
Assume formation.

1118
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,239
All right, you cute little crazies,

1119
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:11,069
let's fry these servers!

1120
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,382
Let's go get them, buddy!

1121
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,163
Servers are fried.
Data backup completely erased.

1122
01:20:41,187 --> 01:20:42,864
Heading to the particle chamber.

1123
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,223
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1124
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,557
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1125
01:20:57,581 --> 01:20:58,797
Wonderful.

1126
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:01,720
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1127
01:21:01,744 --> 01:21:03,400
They're representatives of Hydra.

1128
01:21:03,424 --> 01:21:04,807
They're not what they were.

1129
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:07,163
They're doing some interesting work.

1130
01:21:07,187 --> 01:21:09,706
And I am enjoying myself.

1131
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,726
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1132
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,968
And now it's going to blow up in your face.

1133
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,627
Wow.

1134
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:23,997
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

1135
01:21:24,021 --> 01:21:26,158
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

1136
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:27,785
Well, you figured wrong.

1137
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,311
I know this van.

1138
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,901
Anybody home?

1139
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,741
All right, guys. I am here.

1140
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,149
I am setting the charges.

1141
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,029
Great job, guys.
I will take it from here.

1142
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,746
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1143
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,701
Final position.

1144
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,603
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1145
01:22:32,627 --> 01:22:34,246
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

1146
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:36,220
- I am getting close!
- No, you're not.

1147
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,080
San Francisco P.D.!

1148
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:43,181
Out of the van!

1149
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:44,797
I know you're in there!

1150
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:47,422
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

1151
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,798
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

1152
01:22:54,822 --> 01:22:56,291
So close.

1153
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,156
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1154
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,806
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1155
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,799
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1156
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:07,308
- Get out of the van! Okay, I am coming.
- Take it easy! No, I will not move! Go now!

1157
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,508
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1158
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:23,061
What? What?

1159
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,986
Hey, little guy.

1160
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,805
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1161
01:23:41,829 --> 01:23:42,876
Which begs the question,

1162
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,078
who is the new Ant-Man?

1163
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:47,602
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1164
01:23:47,626 --> 01:23:49,589
trusted even more than me?

1165
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,107
Scott Lang.

1166
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,886
A martyr

1167
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,442
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1168
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:03,123
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1169
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:06,463
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1170
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:12,261
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1171
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,427
And then he disappears magically,

1172
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,724
despite having no money to his name.

1173
01:24:19,748 --> 01:24:22,905
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1174
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:28,602
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1175
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:32,078
Darren, don't do this.

1176
01:24:32,102 --> 01:24:34,244
If you sell to these men,

1177
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:35,761
it's going to be chaos.

1178
01:24:35,785 --> 01:24:37,247
I already have.

1179
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:38,761
And for twice the price,

1180
01:24:38,785 --> 01:24:40,838
thanks to you.

1181
01:24:40,862 --> 01:24:44,324
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1182
01:24:44,348 --> 01:24:46,364
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1183
01:24:46,388 --> 01:24:50,306
I will sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I am keeping the particle to myself.

1184
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,727
They don't run on diesel.

1185
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:55,710
If you want the fuel,
you will have to come to me.

1186
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,645
What do you call the only man

1187
01:24:58,669 --> 01:25:01,710
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

1188
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,967
The most powerful man in the world.

1189
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:06,561
You proud of me yet?

1190
01:25:06,585 --> 01:25:09,685
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1191
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:13,501
It's been too late for a long time now.

1192
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,508
Darren!

1193
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,717
What are you doing?

1194
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:22,005
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1195
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:23,805
This is not who you are.

1196
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:26,750
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1197
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,148
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1198
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,545
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

1199
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,426
Here we go.

1200
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:50,029
Drop your gun.

1201
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,566
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1202
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,717
but you were there.

1203
01:25:56,741 --> 01:26:00,323
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1204
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:01,700
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1205
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,642
but I think I am now!

1206
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,798
Drop your gun now!

1207
01:26:06,822 --> 01:26:10,308
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1208
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,542
Dad...

1209
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,476
Hank, no.

1210
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,230
No, Hank.

1211
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,764
Hank? Listen, you're going to be okay.

1212
01:26:38,788 --> 01:26:40,940
All right? You're going to be just fine.

1213
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,824
Take the suit off, or I will blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1214
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,525
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1215
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:14,086
Request immediate backup!

1216
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,466
Go, go, go!

1217
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,245
Get me to the roof.

1218
01:27:30,269 --> 01:27:31,556
And radio ahead.

1219
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,480
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1220
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:35,603
You two,

1221
01:27:35,627 --> 01:27:38,361
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1222
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:41,669
Dad, can you move?

1223
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,431
We need to get him out of here.

1224
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:49,346
Go get that suit.

1225
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,717
Hey, Scotty.

1226
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,549
Hey, did I save your life?

1227
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:39,306
- Scotty?
- Scotty?

1228
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,280
Thank you, Luis.

1229
01:28:43,304 --> 01:28:44,926
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1230
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,301
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

1231
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,560
Feels kind of weird, you know.

1232
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,718
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1233
01:28:51,742 --> 01:28:53,902
Get out of here before this place blows!

1234
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,868
Damn it! That guy.

1235
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,148
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1236
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,683
The charges are set.

1237
01:29:12,707 --> 01:29:14,758
We have got to find a way out of here.
And fast.

1238
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,759
Don't worry.

1239
01:29:16,783 --> 01:29:19,407
I am not going to die.

1240
01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:20,945
And neither are you.

1241
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,546
It's not a keychain.

1242
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,590
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1243
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,144
And there's a tank.

1244
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,270
A little help!

1245
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,906
I got it.

1246
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,145
We need a doctor!

1247
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:01,700
We have got him.

1248
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,470
Thank you.

1249
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,384
Let's go!

1250
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,825
Ant-thony!

1251
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,426
Go!

1252
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,980
You're going to regret that.

1253
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,846
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1254
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:56,526
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1255
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:58,500
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1256
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,060
Hey! Hey!

1257
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:09,123
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1258
01:31:09,147 --> 01:31:10,745
The windows!

1259
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,010
Did you think you could stop the future
with a heist? It was never just a heist!

1260
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,390
Put the gun down!

1261
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,508
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1262
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:12,428
We got to set her down somewhere.

1263
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,760
I am going to disintegrate you!
Playing Disintegration by the Cure.

1264
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:26,141
Call 911!

1265
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,224
It's okay.

1266
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,028
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1267
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,880
Scott?
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1268
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,123
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1269
01:34:28,147 --> 01:34:30,198
I am taking you back. To prison.

1270
01:34:30,222 --> 01:34:32,756
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1271
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,291
In the bug zapper. There...

1272
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:39,084
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1273
01:34:39,108 --> 01:34:43,480
All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.

1274
01:34:43,504 --> 01:34:44,911
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1275
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,786
Don't be scared.

1276
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,042
Paxton, let me help!

1277
01:35:06,066 --> 01:35:08,118
- Don't move.
- Let me help! Maggie!

1278
01:35:08,142 --> 01:35:10,278
- What's going on?
- He's got Cassie!

1279
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:14,140
- Who's got Cassie, honey? That thing.
- Thing? I don't know! I don't know!

1280
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:23,944
Are you a monster?

1281
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,502
Do I look like a monster?

1282
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,985
I want my daddy!

1283
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,071
I want your daddy, too.

1284
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:37,843
There you are.

1285
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:39,305
Daddy, is that you?

1286
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:41,941
Hi, peanut.

1287
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,101
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1288
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,145
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1289
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,306
There you are.

1290
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,591
Not just me!

1291
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,580
Damn it!

1292
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:26,870
Go! Go!

1293
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:22,240
Scotty needs us,
you know what I am saying?

1294
01:37:22,264 --> 01:37:24,183
Ain't nothing going to stop us.

1295
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,002
Back it up.

1296
01:37:28,026 --> 01:37:30,078
- Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

1297
01:37:30,102 --> 01:37:31,676
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1298
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,400
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1299
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,960
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1300
01:37:35,984 --> 01:37:37,401
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1301
01:37:37,425 --> 01:37:41,586
- Backing up? Yep, just backing up.
- No, no. Just back it up.

1302
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,348
You insult me, Scott.

1303
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:58,420
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1304
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,621
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1305
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,346
Yeah, "I" agree.

1306
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,781
Cassie!

1307
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:40,547
I am going to show you
just how insignificant you are.

1308
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,146
Cassie! I am coming!

1309
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,566
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1310
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,762
I am going to destroy

1311
01:38:59,786 --> 01:39:01,430
everything you love.

1312
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,590
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1313
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,751
I can't break through.

1314
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,748
It's titanium, you idiot!

1315
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,868
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1316
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,361
Sorry, sweetheart.

1317
01:39:27,385 --> 01:39:29,882
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1318
01:39:29,906 --> 01:39:32,701
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay. Stay behind me.

1319
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:36,760
I am going to have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1320
01:39:36,784 --> 01:39:38,908
Get away from us!

1321
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:43,464
Daddy, help!
I love you, Cassie.

1322
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,665
Daddy, where are you?

1323
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,199
You could go subatomic.

1324
01:40:18,223 --> 01:40:19,540
You could go subatomic.

1325
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:21,820
Oh, no.

1326
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:40,162
You would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space...

1327
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:44,949
All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1328
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:50,865
...all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1329
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:57,322
Come back, Daddy!

1330
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:04,385
...as you shrink for all eternity.

1331
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,625
Everything that you know

1332
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:12,309
and love,

1333
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,263
gone forever.

1334
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,270
Daddy, where are you?

1335
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,541
Where are you?

1336
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,825
Where are you?

1337
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:43,829
- Daddy!
- Cassie.

1338
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,070
Come back, Daddy!

1339
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,831
Do not screw with the regulator!

1340
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,269
Daddy!

1341
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:37,030
I love you so much.

1342
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:38,901
I love you, too.

1343
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:40,661
So much.

1344
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,700
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1345
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,061
Sorry.

1346
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:55,828
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1347
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:58,901
Mommy!

1348
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:03,384
She's fine, she's fine.

1349
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:14,310
Scott, please.

1350
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,845
You don't remember anything?

1351
01:43:16,869 --> 01:43:18,077
Hank. I don't.

1352
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:20,587
There must be something else.

1353
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:28,185
Well, I suppose the human mind
just can't comprehend the experience...

1354
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,591
...but you made it.

1355
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,910
You went in,

1356
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,989
and you got out.

1357
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,784
It's amazing.

1358
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,200
Scott,

1359
01:43:43,224 --> 01:43:45,223
I will walk you out.

1360
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:50,705
Get some rest.

1361
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,341
Is it possible?

1362
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:21,442
When did this happen?
Nothing's happening.

1363
01:44:21,466 --> 01:44:25,884
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind
of happening. Well, if that's the case,

1364
01:44:25,908 --> 01:44:27,505
shoot me again.

1365
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:30,442
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1366
01:44:30,466 --> 01:44:32,439
I am a little surprised myself.

1367
01:44:32,463 --> 01:44:34,883
I have to get somewhere.
I will see you later, Hank.

1368
01:44:34,907 --> 01:44:36,470
Really, Hope.

1369
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,965
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1370
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:40,989
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1371
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,319
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

1372
01:44:44,343 --> 01:44:47,105
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1373
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,180
Something happened with the cameras.

1374
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:52,107
Some circuits got fried.

1375
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,437
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1376
01:44:55,461 --> 01:44:56,642
Really?

1377
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:58,185
Well, yeah.

1378
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,880
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1379
01:45:02,904 --> 01:45:04,924
Thank you, Paxton.

1380
01:45:04,948 --> 01:45:06,465
I am blown away.

1381
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:09,045
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1382
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,188
Well, that's my pleasure.

1383
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,549
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1384
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,526
- This is awkward.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1385
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:22,406
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1386
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:26,487
- Oh, I know. What?
- I did my first cartwheel today. What?

1387
01:45:26,511 --> 01:45:29,162
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1388
01:45:29,186 --> 01:45:32,720
But today was the magic day.
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1389
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:38,226
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.
Yeah, it is. This is a professional gymnast.

1390
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,644
There is no way that's you.

1391
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:40,906
Yeah, that's her.

1392
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,430
Good boy.

1393
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:48,071
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1394
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,021
Sorry.

1395
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,429
It's work.

1396
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,346
Yeah.

1397
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,037
All right.

1398
01:46:00,061 --> 01:46:01,840
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1399
01:46:01,864 --> 01:46:03,247
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1400
01:46:03,271 --> 01:46:08,926
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1401
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:11,403
So, I am at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1402
01:46:11,427 --> 01:46:13,716
And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.

1403
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,997
But you know me, I am more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1404
01:46:16,021 --> 01:46:18,761
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1405
01:46:18,785 --> 01:46:21,004
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1406
01:46:21,028 --> 01:46:23,078
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1407
01:46:23,102 --> 01:46:25,124
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1408
01:46:25,148 --> 01:46:28,837
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1409
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:31,283
"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1410
01:46:31,307 --> 01:46:33,040
"Look at the girl I am with.
You know what I am saying?

1411
01:46:33,064 --> 01:46:34,436
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1412
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:37,127
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1413
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:39,119
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1414
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,006
"Yo, I am like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1415
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:44,843
and I got mad connects with the peeps behind
the curtains, "you know what I am saying?"

1416
01:46:44,867 --> 01:46:46,441
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1417
01:46:46,465 --> 01:46:49,486
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1418
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:50,921
"because he works with the Avengers."

1419
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:52,276
Oh, no.

1420
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,797
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1421
01:46:54,821 --> 01:46:56,016
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1422
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,164
"Yo, I am looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1423
01:46:58,188 --> 01:46:59,362
"who's like flashing his fresh tack,

1424
01:46:59,386 --> 01:47:02,007
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1425
01:47:02,031 --> 01:47:05,205
And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.

1426
01:47:05,229 --> 01:47:08,736
We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls
up the walls. "You got to be more specific."

1427
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:11,079
And he's like,
"I am looking for a guy that shrinks."

1428
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:14,603
And I am, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
because I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1429
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:15,723
So I asked Ignacio,

1430
01:47:15,747 --> 01:47:17,844
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1431
01:47:17,868 --> 01:47:20,157
"to tell you to tell me,
because I am tight with Ant-Man,

1432
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:21,500
"that he's looking for him?"

1433
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,711
And? What'd he say?

1434
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,425
He said, "Yes."

1435
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,787
There's something I want to show you.

1436
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:32,268
I realized you can't destroy power.

1437
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:37,865
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1438
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:46,684
This is an advanced prototype

1439
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:49,670
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1440
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:53,791
She never got to use it.

1441
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:58,823
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1442
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,986
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1443
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:17,021
It's about damn time.

1444
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,751
Hey, Cap!

1445
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:35,443
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1446
01:56:35,467 --> 01:56:37,439
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1447
01:56:37,463 --> 01:56:38,517
Even if he did...

1448
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:40,349
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1449
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:43,425
We're on our own.

1450
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:46,151
Maybe not.

1451
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:49,865
I know a guy.
