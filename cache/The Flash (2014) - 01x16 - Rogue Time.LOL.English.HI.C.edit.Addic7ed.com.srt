1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,804
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,868
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,870
by something impossible.

4
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:11,309
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,182
(Barry) My father went to
prison for her murder.

6
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:18,130
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,668
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,843
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:25,546
and find others like me.

10
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:27,883
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:29,120
Mom!

12
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:30,422
(Barry) And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:33,228
I am The Flash.

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,401
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,040
(Barry) Last night, on
my way to the morgue,

16
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:39,545
I saw something.

17
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,616
Taxi! Oh, come on!

18
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:42,987
I'm gonna be late!

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,726
Simon Stagg, remember him?

20
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,562
Hasn't been seen in, like, six months.

21
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,400
You're saying Wells knows where Stagg is.

22
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:49,837
(Mason) No, I'm saying Wells killed him.

23
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:51,777
I have evidence in a secure digital file

24
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,147
that will explain everything.

25
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,450
There is a tsunami heading for the city.

26
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:57,119
You need to get as far
away from here as possible.

27
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,190
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

28
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,660
Go!

29
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:09,135
Aah!

No, no...

33
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:35,450
Taxi! Taxi!

34
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:38,423
Oh, come on! I'm gonna be late!

35
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,691
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,828
(Cisco) Hey, what's going on?

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,268
- Dude?
- Yeah, Cisco.

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,502
I'm...here...

39
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:48,339
What happened? Why'd you stop?

40
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,476
I just got a little disoriented.

41
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,745
Well, you need to make up some time, man.

42
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,316
You better hurry up.

43
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,685
Hurry? What are you...

44
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:57,956
Hurry, as in get to the morgue.

45
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,162
The morgue? I was there.

46
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,332
Yesterday.

47
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,566
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:06,769
Come on, you gotta go.

[camera shutter clicks]

51
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:29,293
Hey, Barr. What's with all the water?

52
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:31,161
Did the sprinkler system
go off or something?

53
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,865
What? No, I checked the sprinklers.

54
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:34,869
They're all intact.

55
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,267
But the water has ice in it.

56
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,170
And the bruises on the coroner

57
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,573
aren't just on his face.

58
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,343
Check... look at his torso.

59
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,083
Whoa.

60
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,484
How the hell did you know that?

61
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,454
He was killed by hail.

62
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,055
We have to listen to the recording.

63
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,123
Recording?

64
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,391
(Thawne) Joe, we got something.

65
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,526
The coroner's office just installed

66
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:58,394
an automated dictation system.

67
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:59,860
Listen to this.

68
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:01,661
(coroner) Please... no more...

69
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,297
(Mardon) I'll stop when you tell me...

70
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,700
(coroner) Just stop!

71
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:05,735
(Mardon) Who killed him?

72
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:07,336
It's Mark Mardon.

73
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:08,671
He wants revenge.

74

[screams of pain on recording]

And I really don't wanna go.

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,875
He's your brother, Cisco.

77
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:17,208
Not by choice.

78
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,174
Okay, well, how bad can
a birthday party be?

79

Um, my folks think
Dante's stink don't stink.

80
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,380
Doesn't matter how much he screws up,

81
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:25,782
or how many times he gets into trouble.

82
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:27,748
In their eyes, he can do no wrong.

83
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,515
And yet, they never fail to remind me

84
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:33,185
that I can do no right.

85
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:34,621
What if I came with you?

86
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,058
What? Seriously?

87
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,459
Absolutely. You've done so much for me.

88
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,894
Let me be there for you for a change.

89
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,930
And I could look at old family photo albums

90
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,465
and see what little Cisco looks like

91

92
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:47,768
I'm rescinding your invite.

Clyde Mardon has a brother?

94
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,276
So, both Mardon brothers
survived the plane crash

95
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:54,644
and then the dark matter released

96
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,246

98
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:58,981
(Barry and Wells) Virtually the same way.

99
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,516
That's right.

100
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,085
Only Mark's not like Clyde at all.

101
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,020
He can do things that

102
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,589
you couldn't even imagine.

103
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:07,758
You mean he's sort of like a...

104

- Weather wizard?

00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,726
Yeah.

00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,994
[slurps] Mm.

Mr. Allen.

109
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,432
A word please.

110
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,002
Yeah.

111
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,675
(Wells) You ruptured the
time continuum, didn't you?

112
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,645
You're experiencing temporal reversion.

113
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,911
- Yeah!
- How long?

114
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,978
Uh, a day and some change.

115
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,545
It's like I'm living it all over again.

116
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:37,846
Yeah, well that's good. That means there's

117
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,649
not too much you could've messed up yet.

118
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,017
How did this happen?

119
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,417
I... I don't know. I mean,

120
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,152
I was running faster than I've ever ran,

121
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,353
and the first time that I lived this day

122
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,520
some really horrible things happened.

123
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,454
There was a tidal wave and...

124
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,055
No. Do not tell me.

125
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,423
I do not want to know anything

126
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,626
about the future you experienced. Nothing!

127
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,627
Okay, but Dr. Wells, I...

128
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,029
Barry.

129
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,401
Time...

130
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,338
is an extremely fragile construct.

131
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,075
Any deviation, no matter how small,

132
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,875
could result in a cataclysm.

133
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,309
Now here's what you're going to do.

134
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:10,846
Everything you did before.

135
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:11,813
Every word you uttered,

136
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,648
every step you took,

137
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,117
you're going to do again.

138
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,351
And you're not going to tell anyone

139
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:19,587
this happened.

140
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,190
[sighs]

141
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,494
Good day, Dr. Wells.

142
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,427
Time will tell, Gideon.

143
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,993
Show me the future.

144
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,562
(Gideon) As you wish.

145
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,365
The future remains intact, Dr. Wells.

146
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,066
If anything changes,

147
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,468
alert me immediately.

148
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,570
(Gideon) Of course, Doctor.

149
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:47,210
[indistinct chatter]

150
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,048
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,250
What's going on with you?

152
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,386
How'd you figure all that stuff out

153
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:01,487
at the morgue?

154
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,754
Lucky guesses, I guess.

155
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,389
Look, I'm telling you,

156
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,828
I'm gonna get Mardon if it kills me.

157
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,095
Joe, um...

158
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,563
I gotta run an errand.

159
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,799
I'll see you later. All right?

160
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:35,985
I didn't know there was
anyone else like me.

161
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,757
(Mardon) I'm gonna break out of here!

162
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,127
I'm gonna create a tidal wave
that destroys your entire city!

163
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,229
(Cisco) So, I still don't understand.

164
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,831
How did you find him?

165
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,734
I just had a hunch.

166
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,369
That's gotta be some kind of record.

167
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,870
[laughs] Yeah.

168
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,438
Well, there goes my excuse

You too.

672
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:45,980
Debatable.

673
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,648
You answer one question for me,

674
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,718
I'll let you and your brother walk.

675
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
What's the question?

676
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:58,491
The Flash. Who is he?

677
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:02,528
I swear...he always wears a mask.

678
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,496
Aah!

679
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:04,531
No!

680
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:05,733
No! Stop!

681
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:07,001
[cries in pain]

682
00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:09,472
This is first degree frost bite.

683
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,675
Your brother could
recover with proper treatment.

684
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:14,381
If not, all his tendons,
blood vessels, and nerves

685
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:15,850
will freeze.

686
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:18,551
His fingers will need to be amputated.

687
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:21,587
No more concertos for
the Ramon family holidays.

688
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,023
Now tell me,

689
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:26,432
who is The Flash?

690
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,359
There's nothing the satellite thermography.

691
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,827
You were right. This is all my fault.

692
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:39,862
How is this your fault?

693
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:43,336
Brave heart, Barry. We'll get Cisco back.

694
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,173
(Cisco) I'm back.

695
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:47,141
(Caitlin) Oh, my God. Are you okay?

696
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,344
We were so worried.

697
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:50,881
What happened?

698
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,584
How did you escape?

699
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,786
I didn't.

700
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:59,391
Snart just let you go? Why?

701
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:03,399
He, um... he tortured my brother.

702
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,500
And he said he was gonna kill him

703
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:09,470
if I didn't...

704
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:11,739
if I didn't tell him...

705
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,972
Tell him what?

706
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:19,277
Who The Flash really is.

707
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,980
(Cisco) I, honestly, man, they...

708
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:25,483
they could've killed me.

709
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:28,454
But they were gonna kill my brother.

710
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,088
I couldn't let him do that.

711
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,590
[cries]

712
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:33,724
Hey.

713
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:34,725
I'm sorry, Barry.

714
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:37,091
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

715
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:40,296
I put you in that position.

716
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:46,606
I'm the one who's sorry.

717
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:53,448
Where are you going?

718
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:59,022
I don't deserve to be here.

719
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,692
I won't be the one to put you in jeopardy.

720
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,329
Not again.

721
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,930
Never again.

722
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,774
Hey.

723
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:18,142
What?

724
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,243
What a surprise.

725
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,911
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

726
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:24,278
As big a surprise as Eddie punching Barry

727
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,711
at a crime scene this evening.

728
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:27,681
Oh, my God. Is Barry okay?

729
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,486
Yeah. He...heals fast.

730
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,955
Look, Iris. This got complicated.

731
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,660
I know. I'm sorry.

732
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:40,298
Barry was too late. I'm with Eddie.

733
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,001
Let me ask you something.

734
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:47,677
Who do you love?

735
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,780
I mean, I love Eddie.

736
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,351
Okay. You need to make them believe that,

737
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:54,620
because right now, I'm not
sure either one of them does.

738
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,220
Okay?

739
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:59,925
Okay.

740
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:02,265
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

741
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,666
Not enough.

742
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:08,068
See you later.

743
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,139
- Bad time?
- Yes, actually.

744
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:17,244
[sighs]

745
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:29,827
Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon.

746
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,397
Well, before you shuffle off forever,

747
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,499
may I show you something?

748
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:48,006
I get it. I failed.

749
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,447
(Wells) No, no, no. Now, you're
an incredibly clever guy, Cisco.

750
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:55,385
So why don't you tell me

751
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:57,655
why would I bring you down here?

752
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:02,564
Because we all failed that night.

753
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:05,268
But we kept going.

754
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,304
We kept trying to protect each other,

755
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,772
and Barry,

756
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,710
in spite of the setbacks.

757
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,445
Making a choice

758
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,146
between two people you love,

759
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:17,049
that is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

760
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:20,222
Well, you won't have to worry about me

761
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,756
making the wrong decision again.

762
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,591
All you proved today, Mr. Ramon,

763
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:26,026
is that you're human.

764
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,866
All you proved today

765
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,734
is that you love your brother.

766
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:35,072
And the reason that we all want you to stay

767
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:37,911
is that we love you too.

768
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:41,082
Now, I am not a parent,

769
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:44,486
but, in many ways,

770
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:46,055
you have shown me what it's like

771
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,423
to have a son.

772
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:55,095
(Caitlin over intercom)
Guys, you should get up here.

773
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,264
Shall we?

774
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:02,833
The casino wasn't the target.

775
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,235
Then why did he do it?

776
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,205
Casinos keep tons of cash on hand

777
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,472
to cover their markers, not to mention

778
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:08,672
the money that they make.

779
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,408
But if they're under attack,

780
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,511
the protocol is to relocate
the money outside the casino.

781
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:14,880
So, that was Snart's plan all along.

782
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:17,180
- To trigger the move.
- Okay, where is it now?

783
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,622
[indistinct chatter]

784
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:32,696
Get ready, we got company.

785
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,957
Aah!

786
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,692
[gunfire]

787
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,195
[tires squealing]

788
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:08,867
[weapon whirring]

789
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:13,671
[tires squealing]

790
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:14,872
Oh!

791
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:17,075
[crashes]

792
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,990
Good to see you...

793
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,555
Barry.

794
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:32,325
We have to talk.

795
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,857
(Barry) I know Cisco told you who I am.

796
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,455
Can't really blame
the kid for giving you up.

797
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,226
You or his brother? Come on!

798
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,560
I put him in a tight spot.

799
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,498
Same kind I got you in right now.

800
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,467
Can't really stop me now
that I know who you are.

801
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:54,803
I could speed you to my own private prison

802
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,506
where you'll never see the light of day.

803
00:35:56,508 --> 00:35:58,009
You could, but then I won't be around

804
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,676
to stop my own private uplink

805
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:01,845
that'll broadcast
your identity to the world.

806
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:04,984
So, the million dollar question.

807
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,386
What to do with me now, Barry Allen?

808
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:08,854
I won't let you keep stealing

809
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:11,590
whatever you want,
whenever you feel like it.

810
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:13,755
- It needs to end.
- Can't do that.

811
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:14,823
It's what I do.

812
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,626
Then find a new line of work.

813
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:17,794
Don't want to.

814
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:19,262
Why is that?

815
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,863
The same reason you keep
running after guys like me.

816
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:24,633
The adrenaline. The thrill of the chase.

817
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,234
I love this game.

818
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:28,501
And I'm very good at it.

819
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,734
Then go play it somewhere else.

820
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:33,436
- Leave Central City.
- Can't do that either.

821
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:35,437
I love it here. [inhales]

822
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:39,038
- This city is my home.
- [scoffs]

823
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,014
You've seen what I can do.

824
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:45,916
You know that I can stop you.

825
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:47,720
You want to keep pushing your luck,

826
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,356
go for it.

827
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,058
But from here on out,

828
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,326
no one else dies.

829
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:54,661
If you're as good as you say you are,

830
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,063
you don't have to kill anyone

831
00:36:56,065 --> 00:37:00,132
to get what you want.

832
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,436
That's true.

833
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:09,410
And if you, or anyone
in your Rogues' gallery

834
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:13,548
goes near any of my friends
or family again,

835
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,520
I don't care who you tell my identity to.

836
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:19,656
I'm putting you away.

837
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:25,664
