1
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:18,833
<i>Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary</i>

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,769
<i>since Velez Sir Flight 180
exploded and crashed</i>

3
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,105
<i>shortly after takeoff from JFK airport.</i>

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,273
<i>It's a disaster that's affected many.</i>

5
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,110
<i>None more so than
Mt. Abraham High School,</i>

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,280
<i>which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.</i>

7
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,116
<i>But it was the events after the crash</i>

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,951
<i>that has turned this tragic story</i>

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,086
<i>into something even stranger.</i>

10
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:42,634
<i>The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed</i>

11
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,925
<i>died soon thereafter in a series</i>

12
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:47,306
<i>of mysterious and bizarre accidents.</i>

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,820
<i>Now, to some, these Deaths
are just tragic coincidences,</i>

14
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:52,912
<i>but to others, they're an indication</i>

15
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:55,793
<i>that there are more
sinister events taking place.</i>

16
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:57,919
<i>That's the contention
of tonight's guest.</i>

17
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,586
<i>Thank you for joining us
this evening.</i>

18
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:00,899
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

19
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:03,303
<i>And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.</i>

20
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,512
<i>Most people say supernatural,</i>

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,342
<i>because they think
I'm talking about ghosts,</i>

22
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:09,062
<i>and witches and stuff like that.</i>

23
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,156
<i>Here's your chance
to set the record straight.</i>

24
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,793
<i>Great. ok. Well.</i>

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,772
<i>I believe,</i>

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,546
<i>that there's a sort of force,</i>

27
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,720
<i>an unseen malevolent presence</i>

28
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:24,264
<i>That's all around us every day.</i>

29
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,327
<i>And it determines when we live and die.</i>

30
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,008
<i>And...</i>

31
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,127
<i>some people call this force the devil,</i>

32
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,700
<i>but I think that whole religious thing is...</i>

33
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,837
<i>so I prefer to call it Death itself.</i>

34
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,219
<i>So I'm surrounded by Death?</i>

35
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:43,297
<i>Absolutely. Absolutely.</i>

36
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,218
<i>Every day, everywhere,</i>

37
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,620
<i>all the time.</i>

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,438
<i>And that's what I want people
to understand that.</i>

39
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,903
<i>Death has this grand design</i>

40
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,352
<i>that we all fit into.</i>

41
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:56,296
<i>So when Alex Browning
got off that plane,</i>

42
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:58,398
<i>and took the other survivors with him,</i>

43
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,138
<i>he basically screwed up Death's plan.</i>

44
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,711
<i>And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.</i>

45
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:07,074
<i>And the fact that all
of the survivors have died,</i>

46
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:09,059
<i>is your evidence of this?</i>

47
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:13,999
<i>Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,</i>

48
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,079
<i>but it's the way that they died.</i>

49
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,709
<i>I mean, there were so many weird,</i>

50
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,876
<i>seemingly random things
about the way they died.</i>

51
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,421
<i>It just didn't make sense.</i>

52
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:29,634
<i>You know, and that's the proof
there's something out there</i>

53
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,718
<i>Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation</i>

54
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.</i>

55
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,605
<i>Kimberly.</i>

56
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,727
<i>You should be more open minded about</i>

57
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,092
<i>What happened after
that was just coincidence.</i>

58
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,192
<i>May I finish?</i>

59
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:48,782
<i>Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.</i>

60
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,951
<i>But not all of them
including their teachers.</i>

61
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,213
<i>Yes, but people die all the time so,</i>

62
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,758
<i>why should this be any different?</i>

63
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,458
<i>It forced people to question</i>

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,233
<i>these so-called everyday coincidences.</i>

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,063
<i>What if they were something more?</i>

66
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,232
<i>What if you could do something about it?</i>

67
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:08,102
<i>Please, are you listening to yourself?
This is crazy.</i>

68
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,605
<i>You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?</i>

69
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,150
<i>That's exactly, what I'm saying.</i>

70
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,616
<i>Exactly it.</i>

71
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,609
<i>And in order to survive</i>

72
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,028
<i>the only way to survive</i>

73
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,461
<i>is to look beneath the visible world.</i>

74
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:26,888
<i>Because in the end
no one can escape Death.</i>

75
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:30,109
<i>And today, may be your day to die.</i>

76
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,971
Ok, I'll call you.

77
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,279
Kimberly, are you sure you've got everything?

78
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,685
Credit card, cell phone, triple-a card?

79
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,111
Dad, it's Daytona, not Somalia.

80
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,137
Alright.

81
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:55,103
Fix-a-flat, road flares, sunblock, mace?

82
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,183
Condoms, whips, chains.

83
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,120
Just kidding, Mr. Corman.

84
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,609
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.

85
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,875
That makes me feel a lot better, thanks.

86
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,128
Ok.
Alright.

87
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,363
Can we go get the guys?

88
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,788
I'm getting horny.

89
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,111
Go on.

90
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:17,885
Ok, I'll call you.

91
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,808
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

92
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,428
Whatever, your dad's cool.

93
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,376
Buckle up!

94
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,312
Watch it!

95
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,832
Easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?

96
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:03,709
Sorry.

97
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,616
Oh my God.
Fucking freak.

98
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,307
Yo Dano, shouldn't we, help your mom?

99
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,063
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

100
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,587
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

101
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:21,889
Whatever.

102
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,347
What are we going to do in Daytona?

103
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,667
We're going to see lots of honeys there.

104
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,565
We're gonna get drunk,

105
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,721
we're gonna smoke this big El gagerero,

106
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:30,818
we're gonna have this,

107
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:32,915
awesome party.
Pileup! Pileup!

108

109

00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:03,993
Watch out!

163
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:49,929
Shaina?

164
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,564
I can't get out of here!

165
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,977
Help me!

166
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,954
Easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

167
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,277
Yo, Dano, shouldn't we help your mom?

168
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:33,109
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

169
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,329
Pileup! Pileup!

170
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,402
Pileup! Pileup!

171
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,412
Oh my God.

172
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:39,439
What?

173
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,161
There's going to be a huge accident.

174
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,188
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

175
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:44,911
Alright, that's it.
My turn to drive.

176
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,514
No, I'm serious.
Kim, what's wrong?

177
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:51,726
What are you doing?
Oh my God.

178
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:54,984
<i>Of flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. tonight</i>

179
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,138
<i>at the Mt. Abraham
High School auditorium.</i>

180
00:12:58,769 --> 00:12:59,729
Highway to hell.

181
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,109
Highway to hell.

182
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:02,456
Highway to hell?

183
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,400
Ok, Kimberly, you're scaring me.

184
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,807
Green means go, Kimmy.
Yeah.

185
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,100
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell are you doing?

186
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,507
What the fuck, Kimberly?

187
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:26,471
What's this?

188
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,761
Kimberly, you just got to breathe.

189
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:36,095
Oh, shit, shit.

190
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,589
Five-O is coming.
Let's fucking roll, man.

191
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:38,439
What?

192
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,479
Oh, my God.

193
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:40,919
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me?

194
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,632
Ok Dano, just shut up!

195
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,304
Just stay cool.

196
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,612
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, I'm going to jail.

197
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:54,572
I'm fucking going to jail.

198
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:09,929
What's going on here?

199
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,161
I think there's going to be a huge pileup.

200
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,080
I saw it.

201
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,580
There were bodies everywhere.

202
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,333
There were logs, I saw it.

203
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,538
It just happened.

204
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:23,558
Alright miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

205
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,201
Just pull over!

206
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,674
I know, mommy's hungry, too.

207
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,007
Come on.

208
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:46,900
Come on!

209
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:48,647
Oh, fuck this.

210
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,810
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

211
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,697
Fuck.

212
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,051
What the hell is going on up there?

213
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:09,304
Excuse me!

214
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,886
Is there any way that
we could drive around?

215
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,798
I have a delivery

216
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,829
You need to get back into your vehicles.

217
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,064
Just move it.
Now!

218
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,309
That's it!

219
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,766
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

220
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,776
You need to stop that truck!

221
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,600
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

222
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,279
Why won't you listen to me?

223
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:37,800
Fuck!

224
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,217
Oh my God.

225
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,340
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance,

226
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:51,524
and backup for a major traffic accident

227
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,800
Kimberly, what's going on?

228
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:21,694
No!

229
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,415
Listen sir, this girl is really freaked out.

230
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,057
In fact, all of them are scared
as you can imagine.

231
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:45,756
Scared?

232
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,777
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

233
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,243
Get this guy, Evan Lewis

234
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,117
yesterday the kid wins the lotto.

235
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,410
Today, some loony bitch blocks traffic

236
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:56,181
and he avoids the worst pileup in years.

237
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,151
I should be so damn unlucky.

238
00:16:58,668 --> 00:16:59,795
Go babysit the rest of them.

239
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,515
I'll be done with Lewis in a minute.

240
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,334
Hey, excuse me...

241
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,539
We're trying to do the best we can.

242
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,646
We're going to get you out
of here as soon as possible.

243
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:11,539
I just think it's a bunch of bullshit.

244
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:21,243
Listen, I know you've gone over
all this with detective Suby

245
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,867
But would you mind telling me
what happened?

246
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,674
It was like I was there.

247
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:36,051
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

248
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,024
I just felt wrong, just like...

249
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,614
Just like what?

250
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,459
Look, I know this sounds crazy but...

251
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,392
You guys all heard about flight 180, right?

252
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,206
The kid who got off the plane?

253
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,819
Well, it happened a year ago, today.

254
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,896
My premonition was just like his.

255
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,282
What are you talking about?

256
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:07,462
Come on.

257
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,395
Sure you must have read about the kid

258
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

259
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,133
so he got all his buddies off the plane

260
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,466
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

261
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:16,942
Yeah.

262
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,823
Yeah but did you hear
what happened after?

263
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,050
So a month goes by, right?

264
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,990
Everything seems cool.

265
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,396
But then all the survivors
start to die one-by-one.

266
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,002
Because when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

267
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,437
You know, some people
even say that Death itself...

268
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,231
was stalking them,

269
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,289
hunting each one down

270
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,192
until they were all...

271
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,170
dead.

272
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,941
Please.

273
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:52,821
There was one survivor.

274
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,908
Clear Rivers is in a padded room
at the Stonybrook Institution.

275
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:01,821
Well, that's encouraging.

276
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:05,591
<i>Ok.</i>

277
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,478
<i>You want me to believe this is true,</i>

278
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,324
<i>that this is happening all over again?</i>

279
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,378
I don't know why we're even here.

280
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:15,534
What do you want from me?

281
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,602
<i>But if I was never meant to pull over,</i>

282
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:20,436
<i>we all should have died in that pileup.</i>

283
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,722
Which means Death could be coming for us.

284
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:24,742
Yeah, like...

285
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,995
What if we're all getting that
different strokes curse or something?

286
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,950
<i>I think you're all are certifiable,</i>

287
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>I can't believe I've been
listening to this crap.</i>

288
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,648
Let's go.

289
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,794
Let's go, Tim.

290
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,500
Mrs. Carpenter, please.

291
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,570
Kimberly!

292
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,670
Oh baby!

293
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:51,887
Are you ok?

294
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:53,150
I'm so sorry.

295
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:55,724
You can all go now.

296
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,229
Thank you for your patience.

297
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,132
Could I ask you something?

298
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:20,871
Anything.

299
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,317
Did mom ever have any...

300
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:25,584
I don't know...

301
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,438
weird feelings about anything?

302
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:30,445
What do you mean?

303
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:35,472
Like visions or...

304
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,342
premonitions.

305
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:40,954
Sweetie, are you sure you're ok?

306
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:41,812
Dad I know,

307
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,789
I know this sounds crazy but,

308
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,825
I'm really scared for the others.

309
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:47,484
I don't know I just...

310
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:50,001
I just have this really bad feeling.

311
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:51,928
What?

312
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,228
It's not over yet.

313
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:21,459
Jesus Christ!

314
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,245
Shit!

315
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:56,956
<i>Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.</i>

316
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,958
<i>Sorry I haven't called.</i>

317
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,630
<i>Hey listen, I heard about your lottery win.</i>

318
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:02,995
<i>Let's hook up.</i>

319
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:04,210
<i>Call me.</i>

320
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:07,016
Yeah.

321
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,734
<i>Hi Evan, it's Nikki.</i>

322
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,916
<i>We met at Tucker's party last year?</i>

323
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,739
<i>I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.</i>

324
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:16,109
<i>I just wanted to say congratulations.</i>

325
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:17,342
<i>So give me a call.</i>

326
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,346
<i>555-0123.</i>

327
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:21,562
<i>Bye.</i>

328
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:23,901
You little bastard.

329
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:25,661
Shit.

330
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,149
Come on.

331
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:33,630
Come on.

332
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,147
Fuck. Fuck.

333
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:54,913
Come on!

334
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,620
Come on.

335
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:04,590
Fuck!

336
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:06,196
Jesus!

337
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,590
<i>Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.</i>

338
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:26,475
<i>If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,</i>

339
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,268
<i>and I don't know when
he's coming back. Thanks.</i>

340
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,686
<i>Evan, call me when you get in,
you lucky fuck!</i>

341
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:04,308
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

342
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:37,803
Jesus!

343
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:44,116
Come on.

344
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,336
Shit, I'm lucky.

345
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:08,125
Jesus Christ!

346
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,872
No, mother just...

347
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,026
just turn on any station.

348
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,732
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

349
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,686
Yes, mother, channel 4 is fine.

350
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,779
Ok you know. Here it is!
I got to go, ok?

351
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:49,786
I got to go!

352
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:50,653
<i>Reach them.</i>

353
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:52,878
<i>To recap our top story,</i>

354
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:56,578
<i>route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.</i>

355
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:59,765
<i>A record-breaking pileup killed
an estimated 18 people.</i>

356
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:02,695
<i>Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage</i>

357
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:05,818
<i>hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.</i>

358
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:08,856
<i>So far police are refusing to release
the names of the victims,</i>

359
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,670
<i>until the families are notified.</i>

360
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,438
<i>The camera of a highway patrol car</i>

361
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,386
<i>managed to catch this shocking footage.</i>

362
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:16,757
<i>A semi comes from reading across the roadway</i>
Oh my God.

363
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,876
<i>And smashes into a red SUV.</i>

364
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,353
<i>The driver of the SUV,</i>

365
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:21,723
<i>standing outside the vehicule,</i>
No.

366
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,398
<i>And a quick action of the police trooper</i>
Leave it.

367
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:24,928
<i>May have saved her life.</i>

368
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,659
<i>He pulled her back at the last second</i>

369
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:28,806
<i>just as the semi plowed into the vehicle.</i>

370
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,816
<i>The passengers inside the SUV</i>

371
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:34,020
You guys see that? Shit.
I was there, baby!

372
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
<i>In other news a freak accident
took the life of a lotto winner.</i>

373
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,669
Hey...
<i>Friends say Evan Lewis was on top of the world</i>

374
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:43,560
<i>after recently winning $250,000.</i>

375
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,818
<i>But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today</i>

376
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:49,342
<i>while trying to escape
a fire in his apartment.</i>

377
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:51,043
<i>He managed to make it out of the building,</i>

378
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:53,438
<i>but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape</i>

379
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,263
<i>slipped and impaled him.</i>

380
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,869
<i>Investigators believe Lewis died instantly.</i>

381
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,126
Come in.

382
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:11,195
Hey, buddy.

383
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,407
I want you to take this,

384
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:15,938
so you can get some sleep.

385
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:20,038
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,

386
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,208
which I know you love.

387
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,168
Now, get some rest.

388
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,256
Mom.

389
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,001
Yeah?

390
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,708
Do you think those guys
were BSing us today?

391
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:34,727
Yeah.

392
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,294
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

393
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:40,399
Lights out.

394
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,485
At the request of the patient,

395
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,479
you'll relinquish any sharp objects

396
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,492
such as. Nail files, pencils, pens,

397
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,121
safety pins, bobby pins, your necklace,

398
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:51,973
matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles,

399
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:54,025
earrings, hair clips, glasses,

400
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,944
shoelaces, paper clips,

401
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,279
watches, money clip, pocket knives,

402
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,919
food, drinks, keys, cell phone

403
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,013
you have a cell phone on you?

404
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:05,493
Poisons, pills, medications.

405
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:07,979
Great. And let me see your nails.

406
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,662
Good. Then I think we're all done.

407
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:12,755
Wait...

408
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,414
Is she dangerous or something?

409
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,060
No honey, she expects you are.

410
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:24,848
Get him off me.

411
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:26,199
Get him off me!

412
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,006
Get him off me!

413
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,407
How long are they gonna
keep her locked up like this?

414
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,633
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

415
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:08,850
Clear Rivers?

416
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:10,173
Don't come any closer.

417
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:21,344
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on route 23.

418
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:24,164
Look, I don't know how to explain it,

419
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,760
but I saw the pileup before it happened.

420
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,187
And I saved some people.

421
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,920
And now you think Death is after you.

422
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:37,679
Nice work.

423
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:41,166
Maybe if you're real lucky one,
you'll wind up in here with me.

424
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:44,536
Anything else?

425
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,033
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

426
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,693
What if the other people are in danger, too?

427
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,710
Well, if you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

428
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:53,965
List? What list?

429
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:55,758
Death's list.

430
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,870
The survivors of flight 180

431
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,610
died in the exact order

432
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,024
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

433
00:34:07,832 --> 00:34:09,493
That was Death's original design.

434
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:12,306
The list.

435
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,739
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

436
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,045
So you're telling me that I'm next?

437
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,517
You said someone else died last night.

438
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:21,005
That means someone
must have intervened.

439
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:25,325
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

440
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:27,197
Congratulations.

441
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,144
You'll be the last to go.

442
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:31,432
But don't worry,

443
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:34,054
once the others are dead,
it'll come back for you.

444
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:37,501
It always does.

445
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,512
This doesn't make sense.

446
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,856
You said that you die in the order
you're originally meant to.

447
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,949
But my friends died last
in my premonition,

448
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,134
not first.

449
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:50,288
Wait.

450
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:53,991
Dead last?

451
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:58,252
Backwards.

452
00:34:58,686 --> 00:34:59,572
Are you sure?

453
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,924
In my premonition that Nora woman

454
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,198
and her kid died.

455
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,385
Then Evan,

456
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:09,545
then me and my friends.

457
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,745
Why is this even happening to me?

458
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:21,500
That's what Alex used to ask himself.

459
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,001
So, what am I supposed to do?

460
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:27,021
Clear.

461
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:30,939
Watch out for the signs.

462
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:32,744
What?

463
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:36,622
Have you ever seen,

464
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,831
anything creepy or ominous?

465
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,214
An in your face irony kind of thing?

466
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,383
The songs on the radio.

467
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,529
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

468
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:51,096
Well, don't ignore it.

469
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,086
Recognizing those signs usually means

470
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,837
the difference between life and death.

471
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:57,536
You got to help me.

472
00:35:57,937 --> 00:35:59,363
I don't have to do anything.

473
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:00,889
But you beat it.

474
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:02,643
Take a look around.

475
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,436
What did I beat, Kimberly?

476
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:09,161
If you were smart, you'd save yourself

477
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,566
and just forget about the others.

478
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,184
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

479
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,259
My friends are dead.

480
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,366
That's how I can say that.

481
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:22,198
And this is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

482
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,038
Get out.

483
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,806
Before you hurt me or yourself.

484
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:33,596
Alright, you know what?

485
00:36:33,884 --> 00:36:34,604
What?

486
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,441
I think you're a coward.

487
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,797
You hide out in here because
you're too damn

488
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,048
bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

489
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,787
In my opinion, you're already dead.

490
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:23,617
I tried calling you last night,

491
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:24,903
but your father said you were sleeping.

492
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:26,917
Evan Lewis is dead.
Yeah.

493
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,089
I've been getting calls all morning
from everyone who was on the on ramp.

494
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:32,549
We're meeting tonight at my apartment.

495
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:33,990
Wait, so...

496
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,496
you believe all this death stuff?

497
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,823
Well at first, no I didn't.

498
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,537
Until last year when I was dispatched

499
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:44,475
to clean up one of the flight 180 survivors.

500
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,028
Clean up, I don't...

501
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:53,689
did you see that?
See what?

502
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,136
Pigeons.

503
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:56,465
Pigeons?

504
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,089
It's a sign.
A sign of what?

505
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,264
If Clear's right about the order then I...

506
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:01,684
Nora and Tim,

507
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,305
are going to be attacked by pigeons.

508
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,410
I'm not following you.

509
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,396
They're next on Death's list.

510
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,816
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

511
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,196
The doctor's ready for you now.

512
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,454
If he gives me the gas and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned.

513
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:04,036
We ain't paying.

514
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:06,645
Tim.

515
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:08,402
Shit.

516
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:15,279
There you are.

517
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:17,419
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

518
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:18,552
We missed you in here.

519
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,192
We got hung up by
that accident on route 23.

520
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:22,431
Good lord.

521
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,327
How lucky that you're ok.

522
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,047
Your mom says you've been
having some pain lately.

523
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:29,635
Not really.

524
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,408
I'm a bit disappointed, Tim.

525
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,074
Does your mom know
you've been smoking?

526
00:40:02,195 --> 00:40:03,568
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

527
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:07,608
Damn those pigeons.

528
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:10,407
How many times am I going to have
to replace those goddamn windows?

529
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,234
We can't do it, boss,

530
00:40:15,258 --> 00:40:16,764
we can't do it!

531
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,415
This will only sting for a moment.

532
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:19,959
Open big.

533
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:22,439
Little bit wider.

534
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,679
Wider.

535
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,192
Ok.

536
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:30,528
God.

537
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,557
How do they expect me to...

538
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:35,543
Would you rather
just have the laughing gas?

539
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:37,050
Yeah.
Ok.

540
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:39,731
Jean, I'm going to need you in here.

541
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:44,684
You're have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

542
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,183
What?

543
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:49,298
I can't hear you!

544
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:51,611
Excuse me, what?

545
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:55,825
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

546
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:56,442
Jean!

547
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,678
Let me get this started.

548
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:01,781
Tim you'll be awake,

549
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:02,737
and a little groggy,

550
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:04,631
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

551
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,185
Ok great, thanks.

552
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,103
Alright, turn around.

553
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:35,306
The cleaning lady said they're at the
Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

554
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,637
<i>Goddamn it anyway.</i>

555
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:51,601
Ok, I got it.
I can't find a box!

556
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:55,359
Not again. Careful.

557
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:38,475
There we go.

558
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:50,110
Jean, how is Tim doing in there?

559
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:56,621
What did he say about your tooth?

560
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:58,729
Did he say...
I can't remember.

561
00:42:58,754 --> 00:42:59,356
Nora!

562
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:00,736
The pigeons!

563
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:01,859
What?

564
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:02,886
Pigeons?

565
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:06,042
Kid, kid!

566
00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:07,203
Come on! Hey!

567
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:09,992
No!

568
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:10,702
Tim!

569
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:11,742
Look out!

570
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:15,006
Stay back, stay back!
No!

571
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:16,247
Please, no!

572
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,706
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

573
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:40,152
No, but she's next...
Right now I don't think she cares.

574
00:43:59,785 --> 00:44:01,544
This is really happening again, isn't it?

575
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:06,090
I hoped we'd get there and...

576
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,917
they'd be fine,

577
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:10,569
and Clear Rivers was just full of shit,

578
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:13,922
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

579
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:18,529
But we're all going to die, aren't we?

580
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:24,772
I'm so scared.

581
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:28,663
I know you didn't ask for any of this

582
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:32,810
But I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

583
00:44:41,661 --> 00:44:43,094
A second one just died.

584
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:44,994
A 15 year old kid.

585
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:48,732
I hope you're ready for this.

586
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,146
It's this way.

587
00:45:05,255 --> 00:45:06,835
How is this guy going to help us anyway?

588
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:09,768
He seemed to know a hell
of a lot more about death,

589
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,328
than he ever told us.

590
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:17,729
Shouldn't we knock first?

591
00:45:18,737 --> 00:45:20,161
He probably already knows we're coming.

592
00:46:07,692 --> 00:46:09,626
Hello, Clear.

593
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:17,359
I've been expecting you.

594
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:19,159
Oh my God.

595
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:21,934
That's Evan Lewis.

596
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,671
Come to pick my brain?

597
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,956
Just a simple question and we'll leave
you alone with your new friend.

598
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:29,482
Dead...

599
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:31,985
yet still...

600
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:33,375
fresh.

601
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:35,235
Look.

602
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:37,008
We drove a long way to get here,

603
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:38,899
so if you happen to know how
to stop the death,

604
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,031
it would be really great if you told us.

605
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:43,414
You can't cheat Death.

606
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:45,416
There are no escapes.

607
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,250
Bullshit.

608
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,084
You told me Death has a distinct design.

609
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:52,663
But Alex and I cheated Death
not once but dozens of times.

610
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:54,133
The design is flawed,

611
00:46:54,157 --> 00:46:55,404
it can be beaten.

612
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:57,929
Such fire in you now.

613
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,831
People are always most alive

614
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:02,723
just before they die.

615
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:04,077
Don't you think?

616
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,152
Look, please

617
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,800
If you know of anything
that could help us,

618
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:33,953
what harm could it do?

619
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:38,669
Only new life can defeat Death.

620
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,693
What the hell does that mean?

621
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,382
Some people say
there's a balance to everything.

622
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:47,991
For every life there's a death,

623
00:47:48,016 --> 00:47:50,349
and for every death there is a life.

624
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:53,427
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

625
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:55,932
that can invalidate the list,

626
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:57,613
force Death,

627
00:47:57,983 --> 00:47:59,218
to start a new.

628
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:09,700
You have to follow the signs

629
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:11,355
Kimberly.

630
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:15,673
How do you know my name?

631
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:32,156
Hey, wait a second.

632
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:33,857
New life defeats Death?

633
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,226
Follow the signs?

634
00:48:35,228 --> 00:48:37,068
Where did you find that guy?

635
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,481
I thought he was supposed to help us,

636
00:48:39,506 --> 00:48:40,905
not freak us out.

637
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:47,672
What the fuck are you thinking?

638
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:52,905
I'm thinking suck on my junk, bee-atch.

639
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:54,399
Little punk.

640
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,492
What is it?

641
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:09,587
What did you see?

642
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,729
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

643
00:49:26,975 --> 00:49:28,036
Kimberly, look at me!

644
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,948
You have to tell us.

645
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:30,181
What did you see?

646
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,287
I was driving a white van and...

647
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,588
Or I must have lost control,

648
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:40,391
because I crashed into a lake and...

649
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:41,550
And I drowned.

650
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:42,593
You were there?

651
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:45,462
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

652
00:49:49,258 --> 00:49:50,633
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

653
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:52,939
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

654
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:56,566
He said only new life can defeat Death.

655
00:49:58,364 --> 00:49:59,898
If she gives birth to a baby

656
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:01,663
that would've died in that car crash

657
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:04,738
a brand new soul that was never
part of Death's design

658
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:06,049
it throws the whole list out of whack

659
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:07,903
and we start over with a clean slate.

660
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,909
It seems like a bit of a reach,
don't you think?

661
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:11,588
What else could it mean?

662
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,177
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

663
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:15,077
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

664
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:18,670
We have to find her and warn her about the
lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.

665
00:50:19,465 --> 00:50:21,214
That'll be an easy conversation to have.

666
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:22,451
How are we gonna find her?

667
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,345
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

668
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:25,771
Hey!

669
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,424
I'm a cop, remember?

670
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:33,557
Wait, that's it.

671
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:37,783
Got it.

672
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:43,098
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

673
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:44,585
Here we go.

674
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:46,938
The vehicle is a delivery van

675
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,330
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

676
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:52,964
We should pick them up pretty quickly.

677
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:54,652
Come on, let's get to the meeting.

678
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,147
Hey, hold the door!

679
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,104
Hey, let go of my shoe!

680
00:51:15,846 --> 00:51:16,930
Give me my shoe!

681
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:26,171
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these frigging bumpers.

682
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,566
Is that dogshit, dude?

683
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,972
Oh, you got something on your...

684
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:48,386
It's still there, bro.
Here, I can get it for you.

685
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,568
No it's... it's alright.

686
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,466
I'll do it if you want me to do it.

687
00:51:59,404 --> 00:52:01,103
Just let...
I'll let me do it.

688
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:03,870
What?

689
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,496
Hey, man, how you doing?

690
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:10,096
Listen, any word on that white van yet?

691
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:13,336
Ok, keep checking.

692
00:52:24,355 --> 00:52:25,675
Does anybody have a valium?

693
00:52:25,758 --> 00:52:26,758
Oh, yeah.

694
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:29,071
Here.

695
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:32,124
You're just going to want
to take half of that.

696
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,278
Keep them coming.

697
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:39,220
If what you're saying is true,
that means I'm next.

698
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,345
This is crazy people, come on.

699
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,608
First Death is stalking us,

700
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,838
and now premonitions, is what?

701
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:48,812
You're not next, Nora.

702
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,207
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

703
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:55,234
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

704
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:57,121
This cannot be happening.

705
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,956
See, because my career is at a peak

706
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,900
and I finally met a quality guy.

707
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:02,507
I just bought a house.

708
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:04,858
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, you'll live.

709
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:08,051
Like I'm going to take advice from you.

710
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:09,633
Ok, look,

711
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:12,411
if you know what to look
for you have a fighting chance.

712
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:15,055
If, I call and say...

713
00:53:15,385 --> 00:53:16,546
I don't know, subway.

714
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:18,457
Get to a high rise fast.

715
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,747
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

716
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:25,132
Get it?

717
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:30,507
Ok, you guys listen,

718
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:33,600
just because Kimberly has these visions,

719
00:53:33,813 --> 00:53:35,468
it doesn't mean we're not all capable

720
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:37,094
of seeing signs to some extent.

721
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:38,946
Ok, ok, look.

722
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,431
I gotta call bullshit.

723
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,266
I mean, I've sat here and listened

724
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:44,079
to all your theories and all your stories,

725
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:45,984
and I think it's just all bullshit.

726
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:47,630
Call it what you want!

727
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,823
It'll keep your ass alive.
Darling, my ass is alive!

728
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,010
Has been all day.

729
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,443
There is nobody after us but you,

730
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:58,523
trying to make us all crazy.

731
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,798
I should have seen that coming.

732
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:16,557
Yeah.

733
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:18,390
If Death is out to get you,

734
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,530
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

735
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,106
She's the only one
that's dealt with this before.

736
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:25,370
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

737
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:26,877
Sleep in shifts.

738
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,231
We need to safe proof this deathtrap.

739
00:54:39,295 --> 00:54:40,924
Get you to step out of the van, miss?

740
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:42,608
Are you kidding me?

741
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:46,096
What did I do?
This vehicle's been reported stolen.

742
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,916
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

743
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,096
No, no, no, it's not safe out there.

744
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:57,716
So, Nora's got to bite it
before me anyhow?

745
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,078
Oh, you people have no sense of humor.

746
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:08,873
Nora,

747
00:55:09,616 --> 00:55:10,485
you ok?

748
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,269
Four years ago my husband died.

749
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,426
Now Tim.

750
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,728
There's nothing left for me.

751
00:55:18,129 --> 00:55:19,563
Don't say that, ok?

752
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:22,523
If it is my time to go and be in heaven

753
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:24,717
with my family, I can accept that.

754
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:28,457
You got to trust me, ok.
We can fight this.

755
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:31,012
If we just stick together long enough

756
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,012
for her to have her baby...
if you'll excuse me,

757
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:34,910
I have a funeral to plan.

758
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,423
Nora.

759
00:55:41,015 --> 00:55:42,195
What do you think you're doing?

760
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:43,824
I'm finished. I'm out.

761
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,724
I mean don't leave, Eugene.

762
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:46,588
Look, look.

763
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:49,435
I control my life, alright?

764
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,560
Not some crazy list Death
has put together.

765
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,893
I'll be sure to carve that
into your tombstone.

766
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,969
Whatever, you may be able
to scare these people,

767
00:55:57,994 --> 00:55:59,219
but I'm not buying that shit.

768
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:00,171
Be careful, man.

769
00:56:00,196 --> 00:56:00,867
Hey?

770
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:02,740
What?

771
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:03,932
Even if you don't believe,

772
00:56:04,468 --> 00:56:05,630
give this to Nora.

773
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,774
I'm just going to put this in the...

774
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:20,724
Closet.

775
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:52,191
Sorry.

776
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,571
Man with hooks?

777
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:25,458
Man with hooks.

778
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:26,598
Hey,

779
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,473
I think I see a man with hooks.

780
00:57:30,399 --> 00:57:31,413
Is that

781
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:35,297
A sign?
Oh my God.

782
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,900
Do you guys see that?
He's right.

783
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:38,104
The phone.
Shit.

784
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:00,831
What the fuck?

785
00:58:12,357 --> 00:58:12,852
Hello?

786
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:13,504
Nora!

787
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:15,063
Who is this?

788
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:16,424
Nora, can you hear me?

789
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:19,142
O... Officer Burke, I can't, I...

790
00:58:19,815 --> 00:58:21,182
I can't hear you! What?

791
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:22,549
What does he what?

792
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,515
A man with hooks is going to kill you.

793
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:26,015
What, what?

794
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:27,229
What is it Nora?

795
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:31,674
No!

796
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:32,441
No!

797
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:33,427
Wait, wait!
No!

798
00:58:33,452 --> 00:58:34,257
Let go!

799
00:58:34,259 --> 00:58:36,192
Let go!
Wait, wait, Nora!

800
00:58:36,194 --> 00:58:38,295
Get me out of here!
Will you stop it?

801
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:39,696
Get me out of here!
Let me help!

802
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:41,064
Let me go!

803
00:58:48,473 --> 00:58:50,199
Let go of me!

804
00:58:58,321 --> 00:58:59,095
Kat!

805
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,141
Help me!

806
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:15,198
Wait!
I don't want to die!

807
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,732
Alright good, I got it, thanks.

808
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:35,035
They found the van.

809
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,560
Isabella's being held at the
Greenwood Lake Sheriff's station.

810
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:41,753
Kiss my ass!
Eugene, what is it?

811
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,092
I control my life!
What happened, Eugene?

812
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:45,777
You hear me, you reaper cocksucker?

813
00:59:45,802 --> 00:59:47,258
Calm down.
What happened?

814
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:49,282
Where's Nora?
Back up! Back up! Back up!

815
00:59:50,348 --> 00:59:51,881
Back the fuck up!
Ok!

816
00:59:52,248 --> 00:59:53,828
Eugene, what's wrong man?

817
00:59:53,852 --> 00:59:54,916
Just tell us what happened.

818
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:56,773
Alright, give me the gun, Eugene.

819
00:59:56,954 --> 00:59:57,790
Give me the gun.

820
00:59:57,814 --> 00:59:59,409
No! Fuck no!

821
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:00,756
It's your Eugene.

822
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,046
You just got to relax, bro, ok?

823
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:04,555
You just got to calm down, man.

824
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:06,475
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

825
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:07,884
No!
No, no, no, no, no!

826
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,482
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't do it! Don't do it!

827
01:00:09,507 --> 01:00:10,762
I ain't going out like that.

828
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:11,575
Hey, Eugene, Eugene, no!

829
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,764
On my terms!
Hey!

830
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:13,940
Oh my God!

831
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,593
You hear me or not?

832
01:00:15,807 --> 01:00:16,353
God!

833
01:00:30,289 --> 01:00:31,688
You don't keep it loaded?

834
01:00:33,624 --> 01:00:34,535
Maybe they're all duds.

835
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,857
Six in a row?

836
01:00:36,948 --> 01:00:37,830
Never.

837
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,315
That's impossible.

838
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:41,004
It wasn't his turn to die.

839
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,990
Can we find the pregnant
woman now please?

840
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:54,563
Is this safe, guys?

841
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,515
I mean,

842
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:57,400
someone in this car
is about to get whacked, right.

843
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:59,545
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

844
01:00:59,805 --> 01:01:00,672
Or her?

845
01:01:03,074 --> 01:01:04,641
Hopefully her.

846
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:07,765
Ok, guys, let's not panic.

847
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:08,778
Isabella's safe.

848
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:10,765
How do you know?

849
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:13,937
When you said she was going
to drive into a lake.

850
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:16,357
How can she if she's in protective custody?

851
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,196
Look at me.

852
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:27,872
Come on.

853
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,433
Does it look like I'm in the condition

854
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,593
to commit grand theft auto,
this is insane.

855
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:33,421
Look,

856
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,764
hopefully the district judge will have
it all sorted out by Monday morning,

857
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:37,619
ok?

858
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:45,741
Marcus.

859
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:47,692
Marcus.

860
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:49,041
Marcus.

861
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:51,558
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his.

862
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,407
Oh my God.

863
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:55,450
What,

864
01:01:55,474 --> 01:01:56,392
what now?

865
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:58,428
My water just broke.

866
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,287
What?

867
01:01:59,512 --> 01:02:01,870
My water, it just broke.
I'm gonna have my baby.

868
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,233
No, not here.

869
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:04,959
No, you can't do this to me.

870
01:02:04,983 --> 01:02:06,419
Don't just stand there!

871
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:08,558
Get me to a hospital!
Give me a second to think!

872
01:02:09,544 --> 01:02:12,743
I am not going to have
my baby in a jail cell!

873
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:14,603
Get me to the hospital!

874
01:02:14,628 --> 01:02:15,721
Ok, ok!

875
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,688
Sheriff Perry, this is
Deputy Adams, come back.

876
01:02:21,162 --> 01:02:23,677
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

877
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:25,869
My van! My van!
Take my van!

878
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:29,586
Ok. ok.

879
01:02:29,762 --> 01:02:30,860
Yeah, we'll go.

880
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:31,772
We'll go.

881
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:33,792
Yeah, we'll go.

882
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:39,459
Come on, come on!

883
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:46,041
You all want to hear something crazy?

884
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,558
It's not the first time I cheated Death.

885
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:53,299
A kid came to school,

886
01:02:53,509 --> 01:02:54,470
with a knife

887
01:02:54,759 --> 01:02:55,966
killed his teacher.

888
01:02:58,153 --> 01:02:59,633
Teacher would have been me,

889
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,725
but I was transferred
to another school two days before.

890
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,096
That's fucking weird, man.

891
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:07,318
You want weird?

892
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:09,588
Last year my partner
and I were heading out

893
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:11,575
when a call came in about a train wreck.

894
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,251
Frank decided to let me handle it alone.

895
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,274
He died that night in a shootout.

896
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:22,286
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

897
01:03:23,353 --> 01:03:24,514
I'd be dead, too.

898
01:03:25,113 --> 01:03:26,066
Oh my God.

899
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:28,539
I'm sorry.

900
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:30,332
It's just I got one, too.

901
01:03:30,714 --> 01:03:32,728
Ok, so last may I'm supposed
to go and stay

902
01:03:32,753 --> 01:03:34,981
at this cheesy little bed
and breakfast in Pennsylvania right.

903
01:03:35,174 --> 01:03:38,053
So anyhow, there's this major gas leak
no one knows about,

904
01:03:38,078 --> 01:03:40,579
and all the guests
suffocated during the night.

905
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:41,931
So what happened?

906
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:44,057
I don't know. I never made it.

907
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,770
The bus I was on splattered
some girl over the road.

908
01:03:46,772 --> 01:03:48,271
Was that in Mt. Abraham?

909
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:50,148
Yes.

910
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:51,775
How did you know?

911
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:54,219
That bus you were on
killed Terry Chaney.

912
01:03:56,173 --> 01:03:58,166
She was supposed to die on flight 180.

913
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:02,154
Hey,

914
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:04,268
do you guys remember
that theater in Paris

915
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:06,666
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

916
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:10,459
Well, I had tickets to go.

917
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:14,172
But one night I'm in Paris and...

918
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:17,293
I'm just tripping on acid and...

919
01:04:17,472 --> 01:04:19,545
sipping lattes and such and...

920
01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:21,645
And then all of a sudden,

921
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:23,014
this dude...

922
01:04:23,811 --> 01:04:25,057
out of nowhere just gets,

923
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:27,217
whacked by this falling sign.

924
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:28,186
Carter.

925
01:04:28,424 --> 01:04:29,344
Wait, wait, wait.

926
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:31,272
The teacher I replaced,

927
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:32,772
her name was Val Lewton.

928
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:35,630
She was from Mt. Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

929
01:04:35,793 --> 01:04:36,623
Shit.

930
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,610
The call about the train
wreck that saved my life.

931
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:42,592
That was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

932
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:45,061
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

933
01:04:46,597 --> 01:04:48,531
The people who got off of flight 180.

934
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:51,838
They were my friends.

935
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:56,756
Kimberly,

936
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:58,288
tell us what happened.

937
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:04,086
About a year ago
my mom and I were at the mall.

938
01:05:05,185 --> 01:05:06,549
I was supposed to meet her outside, but...

939
01:05:07,132 --> 01:05:09,219
I got caught up
watching this news report

940
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:10,952
about some kid that committed suicide.

941
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:13,916
I kept thinking,

942
01:05:14,392 --> 01:05:16,943
how can you strangle
yourself in the bathtub?

943
01:05:17,434 --> 01:05:18,610
That's stupid.

944
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:23,399
Alright, it felt wrong.

945
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:24,187
And yet...

946
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:29,413
I heard...

947
01:05:29,437 --> 01:05:31,474
some gunshots and I ran outside.

948
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:36,246
Some kids were trying
to steal my mom's car.

949
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:39,312
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter and...

950
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:40,556
they killed her.

951
01:05:42,586 --> 01:05:44,006
After the funeral I...

952
01:05:44,325 --> 01:05:46,223
kept thinking
that it should have been me.

953
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:49,692
I guess everyone must think that.

954
01:05:51,998 --> 01:05:53,363
But I guess I was right.

955
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:03,806
Get there.

956
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:05,675
Could you drive a little faster maybe?

957
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:07,410
I'm going as fast as I can.
God!

958
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,722
When we got off flight 180,

959
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,629
it didn't just change our lives.

960
01:06:15,382 --> 01:06:16,961
It affected everyone

961
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:19,598
and everything we've come
into contact with since.

962
01:06:19,885 --> 01:06:21,691
I'm not sure I'm understanding you.

963
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,386
Being alive after we were supposed to die,

964
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:26,363
it caused an outward ripple.

965
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:28,331
A rift in Death's design.

966
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,181
So...

967
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,738
if you had never gotten off the plane.

968
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:35,338
We wouldn't be alive in the first place.

969
01:06:35,378 --> 01:06:37,499
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

970
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,876
It's tying up all the loose ends,

971
01:06:40,424 --> 01:06:42,392
sealing the rift once and for all.

972
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:05,307
Oh, shit!

973
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,154
Jesus Christ!

974
01:07:11,976 --> 01:07:13,516
Hang on! Hang on!

975
01:07:34,578 --> 01:07:36,065
Is everybody alright?
Oh God.

976
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:40,503
God, Eugene!

977
01:07:40,505 --> 01:07:41,837
He can't breathe.

978
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:43,407
Oh, my legs!

979
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:48,244
No, please.

980
01:07:48,674 --> 01:07:49,845
It's not going to wait.

981
01:07:50,019 --> 01:07:51,297
I got to go help those people.

982
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:53,200
Do you want to deliver this baby?

983
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:56,560
Those people can help.

984
01:07:56,957 --> 01:07:58,125
Let's go.

985
01:07:59,752 --> 01:08:01,725
Officer Adams reporting a vehicle collision

986
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,917
off 9-A at the 180 mile-marker.

987
01:08:04,187 --> 01:08:05,867
Send all emergency vehicles to the scene.

988
01:08:07,472 --> 01:08:09,440
Go! Go.
Ok, ok, ok!

989
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:11,731
Go!
Ok. We're going! We're going!

990
01:08:14,283 --> 01:08:15,371
Take it easy, take it easy.

991
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:16,473
Here, here, here, here, here.

992
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:18,774
I think he has a collapsed lung.

993
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:19,583
Everyone ok?

994
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,311
Call an ambulance!

995
01:08:26,784 --> 01:08:27,938
Stay with us.

996
01:08:28,993 --> 01:08:30,459
Hey, hey you!

997
01:08:30,737 --> 01:08:31,511
Hey!

998
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:32,957
Come on.
Help me out.

999
01:08:35,103 --> 01:08:37,927
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, ok?

1000
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:42,612
I think it's ok.

1001
01:08:42,637 --> 01:08:44,662
I don't smell any gas
and nothing is dripping.

1002
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:45,860
Alright, get this thing off me.

1003
01:08:45,885 --> 01:08:46,520
Just pull. Hurry.

1004
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:48,280
Ok. Be careful.
Ready?

1005
01:08:48,474 --> 01:08:49,113
OK

1006
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,300
Ok.

1007
01:08:52,648 --> 01:08:54,395
God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

1008
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,579
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

1009
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,355
I'm so... Dad!

1010
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,149
Eugene, everything's going to be ok.
Just keep doing.

1011
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:08,894
If he doesn't get a respirator,
is gonna to make it.

1012
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:10,176
We're going to get you to the hospital.

1013
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,426
Hey be careful with that!

1014
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,165
Check the gauges on the regulator,

1015
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,650
and watch out for overdoses!

1016
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:17,683
And look out for potholes and puddles.

1017
01:09:17,707 --> 01:09:19,110
You can't come in, miss.

1018
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:22,905
And watch out for power lines!

1019
01:09:24,848 --> 01:09:25,715
Watch it!

1020
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:34,113
You trying to get yourself killed, little boy?

1021
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:36,186
You got to use your head, man.

1022
01:09:39,122 --> 01:09:39,857
Thanks.

1023
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
See right away.

1024
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:49,390
Ok, let's go.

1025
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:07,462
How is she doing?

1026
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:10,288
I think she's going to be ok.

1027
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,637
Can I ask you a question?

1028
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:16,156
Yeah.

1029
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:19,130
When I die...

1030
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:21,536
Is it going to hurt?

1031
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:24,643
I don't know.

1032
01:10:26,604 --> 01:10:27,936
You're going to die after me, right?

1033
01:10:30,053 --> 01:10:31,360
Yeah, I guess so.

1034
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:35,033
Would you take these?

1035
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,913
And if I die...

1036
01:10:46,415 --> 01:10:47,989
Will you throw out all my drugs and...

1037
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:51,576
my paraphernalia and my porno?

1038
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,037
Just... You know.

1039
01:10:56,033 --> 01:10:58,051
Anything that's going
to break my mom's heart.

1040
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:00,617
Please?

1041
01:11:04,934 --> 01:11:05,684
Thank you.

1042
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:12,609
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

1043
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:14,417
reporting live from the Gibbons Farm.

1044
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:16,309
Sheriff Perry, officer Burke here, listen.

1045
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:18,067
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella Hu...

1046
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,000
she did?

1047
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:21,932
Ok.

1048
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:23,434
Thanks. Great.

1049
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,753
Kimberly!

1050
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,713
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

1051
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:28,772
We got to go now.

1052
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:29,809
What about Kat?

1053
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:30,904
I'll go talk to her.

1054
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:33,211
Hi.

1055
01:11:34,025 --> 01:11:36,464
Just find Isabella
and get this thing over with, ok?

1056
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,724
Go on, I'll be fine.

1057
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:47,489
Where's Rory?
I don't know.

1058
01:11:52,505 --> 01:11:54,627
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

1059
01:11:55,052 --> 01:11:57,490
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

1060
01:11:57,515 --> 01:11:58,848
That would be good.

1061
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:28,341
Rory.

1062
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:45,791
Oh my God!

1063
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:48,331
Somebody get out there!

1064
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:50,521
We have to get to the hospital now!

1065
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:51,507
Well, take my truck!

1066
01:12:51,616 --> 01:12:52,745
The keys are in it.

1067
01:12:58,246 --> 01:12:59,199
Kimberly!

1068
01:13:10,955 --> 01:13:11,595
<i>Kimberly!</i>

1069
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,043
Kimberly.

1070
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:14,266
What do you see?

1071
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,462
What are we looking for?

1072
01:13:15,565 --> 01:13:16,805
It's not here.

1073
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:19,774
This one was different.

1074
01:13:20,807 --> 01:13:23,187
It was like the van crashing into the lake.

1075
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:24,888
I was in a hospital I...

1076
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,627
there was screaming
and a nurse was trying to choke me.

1077
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,120
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

1078
01:13:30,147 --> 01:13:31,145
Right in my face.

1079
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:32,313
Kalarjian.

1080
01:13:34,067 --> 01:13:36,741
I think a nurse named Kalarjian
is going to try and kill Isabella.

1081
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:42,614
Listen to me, Isabella!

1082
01:13:42,788 --> 01:13:44,103
I need you to stop pushing!

1083
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,748
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

1084
01:13:45,907 --> 01:13:48,128
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

1085
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:50,634
<i>A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,</i>

1086
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,747
<i>one of them killed by a safety
device meant to protect us.</i>

1087
01:13:54,154 --> 01:13:56,496
<i>Ironically, the woman was impaled
through the head</i>

1088
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:58,848
<i>after her emergency airbag deployed.</i>

1089
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:02,769
<i>She was trapped in her vehicle
after it crashed into a field near greenwood lake.</i>

1090
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,842
<i>Suddenly the airbag went off</i>

1091
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,631
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

1092
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:43,869
We may need to do a stat caesarean!

1093
01:14:44,003 --> 01:14:45,628
Get Dr. Kalarjian up here now!

1094
01:14:46,196 --> 01:14:48,398
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

1095
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:49,866
I'm just going to wait outside,

1096
01:14:49,868 --> 01:14:51,428
because I'm just really in the way here.

1097
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,453
Don't you dare leave me!
Ok, ok.

1098
01:14:54,353 --> 01:14:55,772
You guys, get to Isabella!

1099
01:14:55,979 --> 01:14:57,219
I'm going to find Eugene!

1100
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:00,877
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.</i>

1101
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:04,058
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.</i>

1102
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:21,979
Dr. Kalarjian, in here, hurry!

1103
01:15:23,512 --> 01:15:24,692
That's her.

1104
01:15:26,349 --> 01:15:27,362
Wait, wait, wait!

1105
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:07,335
Contractions have stopped.

1106
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:09,727
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

1107
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:11,774
Bad tracing, it's losing oxygen.

1108
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:14,156
The cord's compressed!

1109
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:16,268
Down to 40.
Oh God!

1110
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:17,753
What's happening?

1111
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:19,029
Where's Kalarjian?

1112
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:21,273
Dr. Kalarjian!

1113
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,303
Dr. Kalarjian!
Not now, I'm busy.

1114
01:16:25,443 --> 01:16:27,112
Hey! Hey!

1115
01:16:27,136 --> 01:16:27,955
Police business.

1116
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:38,839
Just push a little more.

1117
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,032
Oh, no.

1118
01:16:42,419 --> 01:16:43,826
Isabella, is the baby ok?

1119
01:16:45,366 --> 01:16:46,854
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

1120
01:16:46,879 --> 01:16:49,313
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I need to know

1121
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,346
I need to know if the baby's alright!

1122
01:16:54,304 --> 01:16:55,457
It's a boy.

1123
01:17:17,026 --> 01:17:18,908
Thank you.
Congratulations!

1124
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,093
Who the hell are they?

1125
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:22,660
Oh my God!

1126
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:28,704
Clear.
I can't find Eugene.

1127
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:30,592
No, don't worry. She had the baby!

1128
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:31,393
It's ok.

1129
01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:33,643
It's over.
It's ok.

1130
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:48,344
Kimberly.

1131
01:17:48,656 --> 01:17:49,569
What did you see?

1132
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:52,748
I don't think Isabella was ever
supposed to die in that pileup.

1133
01:17:53,062 --> 01:17:55,135
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to be?

1134
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,232
Try to remember.

1135
01:18:14,717 --> 01:18:15,846
Bloody hands.

1136
01:18:16,076 --> 01:18:18,029
Someone with bloody hands.

1137
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:20,076
Eugene.

1138
01:18:25,112 --> 01:18:27,865
Only new life defeats Death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1139
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,872
You saw an ecg machine and what else?

1140
01:18:31,554 --> 01:18:33,656
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1141
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,158
Wait.

1142
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:39,398
Eugene.

1143
01:19:00,183 --> 01:19:02,018
Oh God, no!

1144
01:19:12,362 --> 01:19:13,996
Bloody hands.

1145
01:19:15,866 --> 01:19:16,740
It's me.

1146
01:19:16,897 --> 01:19:18,190
The premonitions are about me.

1147
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:19,034
What?

1148
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:20,405
Crash cart.

1149
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,563
Let's go! Move it!

1150
01:19:24,007 --> 01:19:25,472
Dr. Kalarjian.

1151
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:27,605
ECG machine.

1152
01:19:32,638 --> 01:19:33,698
The lake.

1153
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:35,731
The white van.

1154
01:19:41,217 --> 01:19:42,548
What are you talking about?

1155
01:19:45,301 --> 01:19:46,702
Kimberly.
New life.

1156
01:19:49,339 --> 01:19:50,332
What is it?

1157
01:19:51,842 --> 01:19:53,539
I know what I have to do
to save us.

1158
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:56,738
I have to die.

1159
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,635
No, no, no. That's, that's crazy.

1160
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:01,174
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1161
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:07,776
Get Kalarjian.

1162
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,302
<i>Only new life can defeat Death.</i>

1163
01:22:37,175 --> 01:22:39,402
<i>If it is my time to go and be in heaven,</i>

1164
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:41,736
<i>with my family.
I can accept that.</i>

1165
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,130
<i>Flight 180</i>

1166
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:47,142
<i>I know what I have to do to save us.</i>

1167
01:22:47,355 --> 01:22:49,196
<i>There are no known survivors.</i>

1168
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:50,535
<i>I have to die.</i>

1169
01:23:01,058 --> 01:23:03,158
Ready and clear.

1170
01:23:04,727 --> 01:23:05,903
Nothing.

1171
01:23:08,202 --> 01:23:09,597
Come on. Ready.

1172
01:23:09,906 --> 01:23:10,684
Clear.

1173
01:23:12,895 --> 01:23:13,687
She's back!

1174
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:16,080
Epinephrine. Two milligrams, IV push.

1175
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:18,567
I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.

1176
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:24,592
Welcome back.

1177
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:27,712
They lost you for a minute there.

1178
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:34,831
Hey.

1179
01:23:36,005 --> 01:23:36,898
We did it.

1180
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:40,062
Thanks to you, we cheated Death.

1181
01:24:12,824 --> 01:24:14,162
Would you like some wine?

1182
01:24:14,186 --> 01:24:16,551
I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.

1183
01:24:16,971 --> 01:24:17,777
Alright.

1184
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,635
This is really great, Mrs. Gibbons.

1185
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:22,871
Thank you so much for inviting us.

1186
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:24,566
It's our pleasure.

1187
01:24:26,246 --> 01:24:27,467
How are you doing, Kimberly?

1188
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:28,468
Good.

1189
01:24:28,973 --> 01:24:29,806
Yeah...

1190
01:24:30,307 --> 01:24:31,626
I had a fun summer.

1191
01:24:32,315 --> 01:24:34,786
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1192
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,213
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1193
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:42,607
Hey, careful.

1194
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:43,855
Those things are dangerous.

1195
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,995
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

1196
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:46,761
Yeah, me too.

1197
01:24:46,786 --> 01:24:49,020
Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1198
01:24:49,706 --> 01:24:50,580
What's that?

1199
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,283
Brian was almost hit by that,

1200
01:24:52,307 --> 01:24:53,900
news van that day in the field.

1201
01:24:54,271 --> 01:24:56,880
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

1202
01:24:57,574 --> 01:24:58,397
Saved his life.

1203
01:24:58,681 --> 01:25:00,241
You never told me that Peter.

1204
01:25:01,077 --> 01:25:02,401
Boy, that was lucky.

1205
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:09,318
Brian!

1206
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,980
