2
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:37,520
Okay, come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,053
Oh, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go, buddy.

4
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:43,182
Come on. Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

5
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:46,945
Whoa!

6
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:50,478
Oh...!

7
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,566
Yes, yes, yes...
No, no, no...

8
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,977
Ahhh!

9
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,103
Aw!

10
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,133
Uh!
What!

11
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:02,217
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:05,147
Egg! Egg!
Got you.

13
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:08,970
Ow.
Ow.

14
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,830
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

15
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,133
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

16
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:29,115
Beak.
Wing.

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,263
Tail.
Ribs.

18
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:33,040
Giblets.

19
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:40,007
I'm flying.
No, still can't fly.

20
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,275
Notta dodbly leees.
(Not the top of my list.)

21
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,508
Breathe.
Breathe.

22
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,873
Bottom feeder.

23
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:53,794
Up... and over.

24
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,862
Woo.
Huh!

25
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,993
Ta-da!

26
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,043
No, no, no...

27
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,402
Look, it's okay.
I'm just a clown.

28
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:06,824
Oh boy.
That's loud.

29
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,895
You're loud.
You're... very scared of me.

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,765
Here, come here.
No? Okay. No, never mind.

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,368
Uh.
Happy Hatchday.

32
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,943
Oh.
Hi, pal.

33
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,683
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

34
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,336
Oh, no.
No. No, no, no.

35
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,736
I'm not late.
Look at the time.

36
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,083
See.
The order said, "Before noon."

37
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,797
Okay.
Now, you're late.

38
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,834
- What?
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,933
- It's funny you ask. I was...
- You missed the party.

40
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,498
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

41
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,942
Uh, yes.
I fell on the box.

42
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,428
Oh, the squirrel.
That's on us.

43
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:40,342
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

44
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,132
but...
No, I think I got a little bruise.

45
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:43,884
You see anything back there?

46
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,954
Hear that, honey?
The clown we paid

47
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,628
to be here an hour ago,
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

48
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:52,304
That's why our son's hatchday
party is ruined.

49
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,427
- Oh.
- And the next time you messed up.

50
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:59,163
Don't tell me a story.
Just take responsibility.

51
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:00,899
Hey, man.
It wasn't a story.

52
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:03,385
I'm a screw up
that woke up late

53
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,959
and fell on the thing
you paid for!

54
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,538
It wasn't a story,
I almost drown.

55
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,629
Why don't we just settle this out
and say the cake's on you.

56
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,586
I'm sorry.
It's on me?

57
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,009
Well, who else will it be on?

58
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,871
Well, you know, I...

59
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,404
I'm not sure you're
going to like this.

60
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,760
Um...
but, since you asked.

61
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:33,041
Rather than being on me
as you suggested.

62
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,043
This cake...

63
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:35,799
... is on YOU!

64
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,992
So, you want to hear a story?

65
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:42,707
I run my butt off,
literally, mind you.

66
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,927
To get the "gluten free cake."

67
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:48,435
What the heck is gluten?
I mean, does gluten even exist?

68
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,388
Who are you?

69
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,011
- Get out of here!
- Already.

70
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,596
But, you're the only one
that has cake.

71
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,068
Oh, that's good stuff.

72
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,293
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

73
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:02,022
Who needs plates when
you got this guy's face, right?

74
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,591
Oh, oh, oh, mm.
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

75
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:07,075
You know, I'm suppose to do a
quick customers satisfaction survey

76
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,644
before I... weet weet split, okay.

77
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,653
So, on a scale of 1 to 3 stars,

78
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:11,942
what would you say
about my performance.

79
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,634
And don't forget,
the squirrel was...

80
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:18,813
... free

81
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,137
- Sorry about this.
- No!

82
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,778
My bad.

83
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,881
Huh?

84
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,556
Congratulations!

85
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,816
- Huh?
- Oh...!

86
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,731
It's a boy.

87
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,984
Hey.
Eyebrows.

88
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:21,168
Eyebrows.

89
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,491
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

90
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,991
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

91
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,103
Oh...

92
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,385
Hm.

93
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:04,875
Oh.

94
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,855
Oh.

95
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,331
Your Honor.

96
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:36,897
Our family has always practice
natural child attach,

97
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,746
the risk of having a scramble
infant are too great.

98
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,288
There is going to be music

99
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:46,153
The nest was going to be full
of beautiful fresh cut flowers.

100
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:49,649
And the first 2 faces
he was going to see

101
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:54,305
were the loving faces of his
mother and his father.

102
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,552
We can never get that moment back.

103
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,916
Ma'am, I never wanted my face
to the first face your the baby saw.

104
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:06,762
What are we talking about here.
He probably doesn't even remember me.

105
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:08,087
Daddy!

106
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,902
No, no, no. No.
Shhh, shut up.

107
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:12,455
Shut up.
Cool it!

108
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:16,596
Ladies and gentlemen.
Am I a passionate bird?

109
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:18,989
Yes.
Guilty as can be.

110
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:21,278
It was a quality cake.

111
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:25,310
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there, on time.

112
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:29,154
And he wouldn't even try it.

113
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,379
Mr. Red.

114
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:36,972
We are a happy happy bird community.
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle

115
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,316
We work, we play, we laugh.

116
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,341
We love and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

117
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,940
We love the sound of our
own voice too, evidently.

118
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,391
Perhaps you've never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

119
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,838
I'm going to tell you why.

120
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:55,270
Because, where else
would we ever want to go?

121
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:58,300
- Wow. Not a good joke.
- It kills me every time, guys.

122
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:02,435
So now, what am I
to make of the likes of you.

123
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,890
There seems to be
a recurring issue here.

124
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,469
Anger.

125
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,081
I don't think I have an anger issue,
I think you got an anger issue.

126
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,664
- Oh.
- Oh.

127
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,589
Anger...

128
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:17,860
is a weed growing in our garden.

129
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:21,306
And what do you do
when you find a weed?

130
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,508
I don't know.
But I bet you're going to tell me.

131
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,501
You pluck it out!

132
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:27,339
Oh my gosh.

133
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,801
Mr. Red.

134
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:31,381
When you moved your house
outside of our village,

135
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:34,581
did you notice that
nobody try to stop you?

136
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:37,396
Birds, they may smile
at you on the street

137
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:41,358
but, that doesn't mean
they like you.

138
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,126
Mm-Hm.

139
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,913
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

140
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:48,769
Are you aware that, that robe
you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

141
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,827
We all see you prancing
along the street, your Honor.

142
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,267
And, you're what?
And I'm just approximating here.

143
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,695
Like an inch tall!

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,998
You...
What are you doing?

145
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:00,488
- Viola.
- Ah-choo!

146
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,839
- What the?
- Daddy.

147
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:07,165
Mr. Red, given the
severity of the crimes,

148
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,777
I have no choice but to
impose the maximum penalty

149
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,275
allowed by the law.

150
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,621
Anger management class.

151
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:20,648
Aw.
Pluck my life.

152
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,613
- Fresh worms, caught today.
- Huh?

153
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:25,884
Hey, Red.
How are you?

154
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,153
Oh, I'm horrible.

155
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,460
Oh. Hi, Red.
It's good to see you.

156
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,542
I wish I could
say the same.

157
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:34,339
- Ups-a-daisy
- Aw! Ow.

158
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:35,795
Thank you.

159
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:38,918
Huh?

160
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,300
- Huh?
- Nm-mm.

161
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,577
- Let's go.
- Oh.

162
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:45,214
How are you, Suzie?
You good?

163
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,416
No running.
No running.

164
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,650
- Oop.
- Come on.

165
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:53,362
Hey.
How's that nap schedule coming along?

166
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,765
Oh boy.

167
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,246
Y'guys ever thought about bird control.

168
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:01,196
Left, right, left, right,
there you go.

169
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,140
Hi.
Hi.

170
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:15,563
Alright.
Oop!

171
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,116
Girlie. Girlie.
You got this.

172
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,678
We don't want you to fall now,
take your time.

173
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,896
Here we go.
That's it.

174
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,314
Oh, you're doing it.

175
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,759
- Seriously?
- I'm almost there.

176
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,054
<font color="#379bff">(HUG TRADER)</font>

Crane pose.

182
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Wow.

183
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,152
Mighty Might Eagle soaring free.
Defender of our homes and liberty.

184
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,856
Hi, Red.
Is one of those yours?

185
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,022
What?

186
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:09,090
Yeah.
When birds fly.

187
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,937
Mighty Eagle is a legend.

188
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,109
You think that's funny.
Ha ha ha. This is funny.

189
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,487
Oh oh.

190
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,233
What?

191
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:43,946
Don't look, Bobby.

192
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,331
The anger might be contagious.

193
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,062
Let's go.

194
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,702
He started it.

195
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:53,769
There you go.

196
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,738
Ah-hah.

197
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh, look at this.
This is going to be awful.

198
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,020
Okay, I guess that's art.

199
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,478
That's garbage.

200
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:20,484
And that's,
exotic.

201
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,290
- Free rage what?
- Oh, hi.

202
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,761
- Hi, there. Welcome...
- Hello.

203
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,977
... to the Infinity Acceptance Group.

204
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,548
- I, am Matilda.
- Okay.

205
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:35,038
And I'm just super psych to be
taking this journey with you

206
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:37,363
Oh.
You're gonna have a blast!

207
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:41,013
I'm really fun.
Everybody says that about me.

208
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:43,965
Hey, guys.
Say hello to Red, everyone.

209
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,495
Hello.

210
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,879
Hi, Red.

211
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:48,956
Hello, birds I won't
get to know well.

212
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:51,493
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time.

213
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:53,461
Because you're about 2 minutes late,
don't let it happen again.

214
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:55,620
Hi, my name is Chuck. I'm sorry
we got off on the wrong foot.

215
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,456
I like you a lot.
I can tell.

216
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,187
Okay.
Now, Red.

217
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:02,474
Would you like to share
your story with us?

218
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,599
No.
Not really.

219
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:06,741
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

220
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,292
at a child's birthday party.

221
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,219
How long is this class anyway?

222
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,618
As long as you make it.

223
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:15,120
Really?
Oh, okay.

224
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,324
Uh, gentlemen,
very nice to see you.

225
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,199
And uh, almost meet you.

226
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:21,040
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you.

227
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,225
You know,
in some weird away.

228
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,451
Alright.
So, I'm gonna go ahead and...

229
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:28,545
scoot on back out, past
those creepy statues and...

230
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,225
HAH!
Back you go.

231
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,140
Sure. No, I can...
take a seat.

232
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,408
So, in another sense,

233
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,386
you are here until I
notify the court

234
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,946
that your anger issues
have been resolved.

235
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:42,623
Oh boy.

236
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,157
Chuck!
Share your story with Red.

237
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,375
Me? I'm the last guy
that should be here.

238
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,714
Simple speeding ticket.

239
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:49,991
Judge tells me
I was going too fast,

240
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,652
So I say, "Your Honor.
To be honest. I was"

241
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,837
You caught me.
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

242
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:57,324
So, shouldn't I be in an
honesty management class?

243
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,791
'Cause we got to
manage my honesty.

244
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,995
Mmf-hmm.

245
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,772
My one problem,

246
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,886
that's a different story
than you told last time.

247
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,578
Uh-uh...

248
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,507
<font color="#ff9933">Officer
Bill Beakins</font>

249
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,875
Drinks on me, guys!

250
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:42,758
Chuck...

251
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,806
Okay.
Maybe, it wasn't ice cream.

252
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,698
Alright, Chuck.
Thanks, we got it.

253
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:50,305
And this is Terence.

254
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:53,218
Woof.
More like, terrifying

255
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,533
No.
It says here in the little filey.

256
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:13,836
Terence uh, seems to have an
incident.

257
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:17,219
Now, Bomb's started
with us 2 weeks ago

258
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,201
Tell us your story, Bomb.

259
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:23,415
Okay.
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

260
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,454
I... have been known to...
blow up.

261
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,954
So, like uh. Like what?
Like you get mad, you mean.

262
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:33,972
Well. No.
I literally blow up, okay.

263
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:37,256
I explode like a bomb.

264
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,350
Hence the name.

265
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,080
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

266
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:54,091
Excuse me.
Party foul.

267
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,280
Ow!

268
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,273
- Do it!
- No can do.

269
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:00,987
I just went boom-boom
before class.

270
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,331
Hey, look.
I don't want to be here and all,

271
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,613
but this can maybe make it
a little more interesting to me.

272
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,340
So.
Please, explode.

273
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:08,442
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, I can.

274
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,777
But, I'm having back issues today,
so...

275
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,219
I'm gonna have to
take a rain check.

276
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,607
Oh...
Do it!

277
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,359
This is not the time
or place, little amigo.

278
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,885
These guys are all nuts,
huh, big man?

279
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:24,462
Are we speaking telepathically
or you're just...

280
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:27,704
Good talk.

281
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,318
Nice chatting with you.

282
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,067
Managing our anger
through movement.

283
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:40,139
The first pose is
the dancer pose.

284
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,027
Great form, Terence.

285
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,138
Eagle. Parrot.
Peacock? Warrior.

286
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,236
Mountain. Tree. Rabbit.
Fish. Locust. King pigeon.

287
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,639
And of course, downward duck.

288
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,193
- Excuse me, boring heavy lady.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,838
Looks like the exploding
guy's gonna puke.

290
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:55,639
And have you done this before?

291
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,274
Uh, yes, I have.
But, usually not for free.

292
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,547
- Didn't think so.
- Awesome.

293
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:01,123
And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

294
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:04,039
Doing wonderful.
Stretching out the core.

295
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,549
Just remember to breathe,
up to your feathers,

296
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:11,818
and from your talons.

297
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:13,239
Bomb?

298
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:19,268
Nice.

299
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,493
I don't know what happened

300
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,557
I was doing the poses.
I was feeling all zen.

301
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,348
Matilda was digging it!

302
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,846
Then I lost my grip on it.

303
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,058
I let it slipped and
it just squeaked out.

304
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,356
Hey.
So, where are we going?

305
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,894
I'm sorry.
We?

306
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,931
Yes, we

307
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:37,388
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

308
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,155
that I'm dying to see.

309
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,580
Uh, you know what?
I... I mean I got a...

310
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,491
- I got a thing.
- A thing?

311
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:44,778
Like a disease?

312
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,709
Huh! Is it bird flu?
Chicken pox?

313
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,051
Huh!
Cardinal sin?

314
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:53,532
No. By thing, I mean like...
desire not to hang out, with you.

315
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:54,900
Oh.

316
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,778
Oh, yeah. Well, may... you know.
Maybe for the best, you know.

317
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,451
Because... I got something too.

318
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,359
Ha!
How did I forget?

319
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:04,948
Even if you'd say yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

320
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:10,787
I'm busy too,
I have a...

321
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:14,351
Business offer... deal
that is...

322
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:16,264
No, Bomb.
You're not good at this, buddy.

323
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,073
It's-It's charming up to a point
and now it's just sad.

324
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,991
It's a guy I know.

325
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:29,865
And he's opening up a brand new
luxury class reunion.

326
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,329
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.

327
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,513
Looks like it's just us.
Want to go get a bite?

328
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,409
Oh, but what about your class reunion,
where everybody brings a business offer.

329
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:44,377
Oh. No, no, no.
Chuck, I was lying.

330
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,466
 I'm sorry if I've fooled you.

331
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:53,487
Nah-uh.
No means no.

332
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,111
I love your eye.

333
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,794
Cheers.

334
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:01,472
- Hey!
- Huh?

335
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:05,137
- Get over here!
- Hey, pecker heads.

336
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,171
- What's up?
- Yo.

337
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,459
Hey, man.

338
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,931
Oh.

339
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:14,939
Oh.

340
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,272
- Oh, I felt a peck.
- Whoa.

341
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,883
Ah...

342
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:38,341
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle.

343
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:43,268
Our protector and hero, but
no one has seen him for years.

344
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,174
Mighty Eagle is missing.

345
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:48,538
When's Mighty Eagle
going to come back.

346
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,828
Eyebrows, didn't your parents
ever tell you,

347
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,533
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

348
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,687
Shhh. He doesn't know that.
He doesn't have parents.

349
00:20:56,712 --> 00:21:00,064
- He does not have parents.
- Yeah, or even friends.

350
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,724
Ah ha!
Eureka!

351
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,262
Say bye to daddy.

352
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,594
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

353
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,284
- Goodbye, hatchlings.
 - Bye!

354
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,329
- Have a happy day.
- Bye.

355
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:04,256
- Good morning.
- Morning, your Honor.

356
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:06,705
Here you go.

357
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,115
- Ah-Choo!
- Bless you.

358
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,005
- Yes!
- Bye, daddy's making dinner.

359
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,169
If my name were Bobby,
would you ask about my hobbies.

360
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:24,330
- Wow
- Or if my name were Judas,

361
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:27,038
would you ask me
what my mood is?

362
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:30,675
I laugh, I cry,
I love, I hate.

363
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,494
I do so much more
than detonate.

364
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,140
Think of it

365
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,765
That was beautiful.

366
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,510
You're gonna make me cry.

367
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:44,198
Yeah, that was some real
clever symbolism.

368
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:47,035
Ah! Red, why don't
we hear you poem?

369
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,204
I don't have a poem.

370
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:49,835
Uh-huh.
Why not?

371
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,569
Because I didn't write one.

372
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:55,866
Right, uh-huh.
And, is there a reason?

373
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,292
Well. You know,
I was gonna do it,

374
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:58,891
but then I thought about it.

375
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,922
and I realized,
"Oh, this is a huge waste of my time."

376
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,611
So I didn't do it.

377
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:07,472
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH!

378
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:10,769
And we're back in the now.
Chuck!

379
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:13,913
- You had your hand up the whole time.
- Um-Hm.

380
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,090
My poem,
is about a hate crimes

381
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,564
- How did it...?
- Oh oh.

382
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,840
Oh no.

383
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:26,066
A lot of sickos out there.
A lot of sickos.

384
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:30,611
What? Oh, what
did I make you of?

385
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,346
- I made you out of love.
- Wow.

386
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,799
But, wait. Too late.
Now I see your fate.

387
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:41,074
Some very troubled somebody
destroyed you out of hate.

388
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:48,864
What could have made him so despise
your happy smile, your laughing eyes.

389
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,259
Your soul was pure.
Your heart was true.

390
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:57,063
And someone hated that.
But, who?

391
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,522
Oh!

392
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,484
Terence.

393
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,840
Whoa!
<font color="#ff8080">[ HANG IN THERE ]</font>

394
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,156
Yeah, I deserve that.
Oh.

395
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:14,137
Billy has passed
to a high plane of existence.?

396
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:16,753
Everyone join wings.

397
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:19,377
Let us,
all say our goodbyes.

398
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,424
Yeah. Let me get in here,
I got to say goodbye...

399
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:22,740
Okay.

400
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,392
Okay. You know, I'll just mourn
from back here, that's fine.

401
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,813
You know, if there is one thing
Billy always hated was goodbyes.

402
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,375
- Hey. What's going on there?
- Huh?

403
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,928
Class dismiss.

404
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:36,792
Very moving.

405
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:38,172
Come on, everybody.
Let's go!

406
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:39,711
Hey.
Where's everybody going?

407
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,282
Hurry, something's coming!

408
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,942
- Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!
- Let's go.

409
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,132
Coming through. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

410
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,356
What?

411
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:55,759
Aw.
Again?

412
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:57,729
Let's get down to the beach!

413
00:24:57,754 --> 00:25:00,311
- Follow me.
- Let's get down to the beach.

414
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,293
What?

415
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,385
Huh?

416
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,831
I didn't mean to photo bomb you,
sorry about it

417
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:15,970
What is that thing?

418
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:20,149
It looks like an UFO.
An unidentified floating object.

419
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,770
Daddy!

420
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:24,592
Stop it.
No, I'm not your daddy.

421
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,768
- What is that?
- Look at the size of that thing.

422
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,100
Where is it going?

423
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,537
I don't know,
but it's not stopping.

424
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:35,858
My house.
My house.

425
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:38,837
Slow down!
Stop!

426
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:46,940
Oh.

427
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,135
Phew.

428
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,794
What the?

429
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:01,263
That house took me
5 years to build.

430
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:02,353
Wow.

431
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:06,803
It's such a shame when you create
something and someone just destroys it.

432
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:10,506
Ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:13,702
- We have a very special guest for you.
- Huh?

434
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,541
- He's a green marine sailing machine.
- Here we go.

435
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:19,588
And he's king, to let you know,
he's not mean.

436
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:24,680
Put your wings together for
Leonard!

437
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh.
Thank you very much.

438
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:30,550
Please hold your applause.

439
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:36,307
Greetings from my world,
the world of the pigs.

440
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,071
What's a pig?

441
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,147
I am a pig!

442
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:48,253
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

443
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:52,107
Oh, where're we going?
Wrong way.

444
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,251
Oopsie.
Not working.

445
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:56,600
We practiced this a hundred times.

446
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,244
- Oh, man.
- Give it to me.

447
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,254
- Oh.
- We're gonna come in again.

448
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,896
I'm so sorry.

449
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:08,198
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

450
00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:10,584
- Oh, ho ho ho! Very generous.
- Yeah.

451
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:11,597
- Thank y...
- Oh.

452
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:13,671
- We mean no harm.
- Aw. Ow.

453
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:17,724
We saw your island across the sea
and we thought,

454
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,239
"I wonder what they're up to?"

455
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,889
But, there's no other place
besides here.

456
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:24,990
Yes, there is.
And we are from there.

457
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:27,332
We call it, Piggy Island.

458
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:28,672
Oh my gosh.

459
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,634
P-I-GG-Y Island.

460
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,139
Who else is out there?

461
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:37,395
My first officer, Ross and I
have sailed everywhere.

462
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,188
One brave soul against the sea,
and Ross.

463
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:42,425
Ah, excuse me.

464
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,868
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

465
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:49,291
- Oh, man.
- Ho ho. Somebody want a gift basket.

466
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:51,900
Please. Please.
Don't be afraid.

467
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:55,469
My partner and I request
the honor of your friendship.

468
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:57,758
- Ross, show them how'd we do it.
- Oh?

469
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:00,062
Don't worry, he's always shy.

470
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:01,945
- Well, I'll say now.
- Hi! Uhh!

471
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,374
Hi, friends.

472
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,146
Oh, not a hugger.

473
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,394
Welcome to Bird Island.

474
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,610
Welcome to our new friends,
the Pigs.

475
00:28:14,634 --> 00:28:17,793
- Let us have a celebration!
- Put it there!

476
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,281
- Welcome
- Oh.

477
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,507
What?
Sorry.

478
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,698
And a hoof to a wing.

479
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:25,652
We would like to honor the pig's
with a special performance.

480
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:32,184
Oh, watch out.
Shaking my bacon.

481
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,379
They don't have feathers?

482
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:36,667
You know, they're just walking around
naked just presenting themselves.

483
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:38,538
I'm looking at all
their business here.

484
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,245
That part about them,
I really admire.

485
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,078
Now we would like to welcome
our special guest, the PIGS!

486
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:45,961
- Yay.
- Alright.

487
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:48,972
Thank you for your kindness
and hospitality.

488
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:51,746
- Our king sends his warmest regards.
- King?

489
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:56,950
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint simple little island.

490
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:59,119
Drop the banner, Ross!

491
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,601
Ah!
Whoa!

492
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:05,079
Now, we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

493
00:29:05,104 --> 00:29:07,231
Ha! Yeah.
Humble my bird butt.

494
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,297
Language.

495
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:11,107
100 years from now,
everyone will ask,

496
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:15,257
"How do the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

497
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:16,544
Who cares!

498
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:18,012
- Oh no.
- Hey.

499
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:21,613
Well, let them say us,
"We lite up the night!"

500
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,438
Holy moley!

501
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,665
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

502
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,617
Hey, look. They destroyed more of
the stuff we worked hard to build.

503
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:34,590
But, there's more!
- More?

504
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:36,626
Has gravity gone haywire?

505
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:41,705
No! Even better, your friends,
the pigs, proudly give you...

506
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,327
- The trampoline!
- Oh.

507
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,626
Those are my assistance.

508
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,433
- Oinky and John Ham!
- Hello.

509
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,844
Hey, hold on a second. I thought there's
only suppose to be 2 of these guys.

510
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,049
What goes?
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

511
00:29:57,074 --> 00:30:01,147
But, that's not all, throwing things
just got a whole lot easier.

512
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:03,115
Say hello to...

513
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:06,048
- "The Slingshot!"
- Ta-da!

514
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,211
- I can't see.
- This is crazy.

515
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:08,768
Wow!

516
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:10,900
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- Yeah!

517
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,666
Wish you could just get it there?

518
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:13,736
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

519
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,411
Well, now you can!

520
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:16,853
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh!

521
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,381
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Okay.

522
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:21,054
Hey, if you got the night off
why don't you fix my house.

523
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,626
Yeah.
It's the same guy.

524
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:28,105
Well, the slingshot does it all
in 3 easy steps.

525
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,819
Ready.
Aim!

526
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:31,678
- Fire!
- I got it.

527
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:36,282
- Follow them fish!
- Me! Me! I want fruit!

528
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:40,365
Guys. It's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

529
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,445
And now, for our
last gift to you.

530
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,995
Shut up and fix my house!

531
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,025
We don't know him.

532
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:54,222
I'm going to ask for a volunteer
from the audience.

533
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:55,252
- Me!
- Me!

534
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:56,914
Who should I pick?

535
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,599
- Who, who, who.
- Pick me, Mr. Pig.

536
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,419
How about the red guy,
with the enormous eyebrows?

537
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,496
- Aw.
- Ha ha ha ha.

538
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:04,329
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

539
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,114
Oh. No, no, no, no.

540
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,673
Yes, you sir. Come on
up here it's your lucky day.

541
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,167
Are you sure you don't
want to choose

542
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:12,840
one of the 100s of birds
that had their wings up?

543
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:16,033
- Get him up here!
- Come on, Red. Have some fun!

544
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,799
- Go!
- Go!

545
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,996
Oh, he's shy.

546
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:22,016
You hear that?
They're cheering for you!

547
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,401
Uh.
You got to be kidding me.

548
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,474
Red guy with the eyebrows!

549
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:27,250
I would have sat closer
had I known.

550
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,088
that I was going to be
part of the show.

551
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,200
- Okay. Now what?
- Come on, give him a hand.

552
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,171
Right this way, come on.
Relax, deep breathe.

553
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,177
Ready!

554
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:37,329
Who? Me?
Yeah. No. I'm ready.

555
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,825
- Aim!
- Aim at what?

556
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,073
Everybody on this one.

557
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,421
- Fire!
- Fire!

558
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:45,823
Who says birds don't fly

559
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:47,865
This seems really unnatural!

560
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,348
- Huh!
- Aw. I hope he's okay.

561
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,606
Ow.

562
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,641
Hey, don't worry.
I'm fine.

563
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,256
Thanks for the lift!

564
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:04,979
I wished they would have
done that 10 minutes ago.

565
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,877
Huh.

566
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:12,033
You know you want to
search their boat.

567
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,560
What?
No, I don't.

568
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:16,484
Yeah, you're right, I do.

569
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:20,530
Bomb's on his way.
Mm. Mmm.

570
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:23,307
Come on.
Let's go!

571
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,815
And remember, keep it quiet.

572
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:29,397
Oh, yeah.

573
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:33,281
Whoa!
This is an impressive ship.

574
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:36,314
Shh. No. Inside voice.
Inside voice. Come on.

575
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,634
Sorry.

576
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,322
Piggy fitness.

577
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:42,441
- Mm?
- Nmm?

578
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,683
Mm-hm.

579
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:48,415
<font color="#80ff80">FIFTY SHADES
OF GREEN</font>

580
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,701
Very strange.

581
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,669
- Huh?
- Aw!

582
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:04,360
Who are these weirdos?
Huh?

583
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,393
What are you doing,
we're trying to sneak around.

584
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:12,716
We didn't rent this place out.

585
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,945
Wow, you can rent this place?

586
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,670
- Hm.
- Give me that!

587
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,434
- Huh!
- Huh!

588
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,029
Hey, guys!

589
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:28,462
Looks like there's some more
stuff down here.

590
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:35,210
We were hiding.

591
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,429
When I say "Hey."
You say "Ho."

592
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,213
- Hey!
- Ho!

593
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:43,660
- Hey!
- Ho!

594
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:44,931
- Hey!
- Ho!

595
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,734
There's more of them!

596
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,423
- Hey!
- Ho...!

597
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:51,757
That's right.
I'm back, uh-huh.

598
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,399
Enjoying the party, everyone?

599
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:58,788
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck up onto their boat.

600
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,391
- What!
- What did he say?

601
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,235
And look at what I found.

602
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:05,666
There's more of them!
Than we thought.

603
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,688
Which is uh... mysterious and weird.
Am I right?

604
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,094
Ho ho ho ho.
Ho ho.

605
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,612
Hi.

606
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,177
- How're you doing?
- Oh.

607
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:16,255
You remember. He said there
were only 2 pigs on board,

608
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,416
- but he was obviously lying.
- Hmm.

609
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:22,651
Oh, and there's strange
devices on their boat!

610
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:25,506
So clearly there's... you know,
some messed up stuff going on here.

611
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,003
How messed up?
I don't know

612
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,260
What's specifically?
I don't know either.

613
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,165
Any questions?

614
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,733
You snuck onto their boat?

615
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,719
You know.
I don't need a award.

616
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,165
If you guys are trying to think of
what honor to bestow upon me

617
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,763
- Don't need it.
- Boo!

618
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,178
Yeah, boo them.

619
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:44,607
- Boo.
- Boo.

620
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,010
- You're booing them or me?
- You.

621
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:47,417
Oh, it's me.

622
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:50,067
Perhaps, I can explain.

623
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:53,673
You see, my cousins
are simple folk.

624
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:57,709
Watch.
A, B, C...

625
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:00,324
Nothing.
See, nothing.

626
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,126
I didn't want to risk their lives

627
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,684
until I found out that the...
the new world was safe.

628
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,530
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

629
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:12,433
Let her go, boys!
Yee-haw!

630
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,792
- Ha ha, yeah!
- Yoo!

631
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,266
Shhh.

632
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,728
 . . ..

633
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:21,254
- That was Pigleand.
- Oh.

634
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,863
But perhaps,
it wasn't meant to be.

635
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,613
Oh.

636
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:28,793
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

637
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:33,604
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

638
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:35,521
- Oh.
- Oh.

639
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:38,452
Mr. Red,
you shamed not only yourself,

640
00:35:38,477 --> 00:35:40,572
but our entire community.

641
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,009
Oh, I think you messed up there.

642
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,086
You said shamed when
you meant saved, right?

643
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:47,504
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

644
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:50,137
Clearly, more treatment is required.

645
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,539
- No!
- No!

646
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:55,038
Do not trouble
our honored guests again!

647
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:59,901
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

648
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:02,842
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

649
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:05,210
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands together!

650
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:06,322
- Woo-Hoo!
- Yeah!

651
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,224
Whatever.
Don't listen to me.

652
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,149
Body train coming through.
Choo-choo.

653
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:22,832
Ah! I can't see.
I can't see.

654
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:24,422
Whoa!

655
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,013
- This is fun!
- Piggyback rides?

656
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,995
Yee-haw!
Let's move it there.

657
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,940
Oh boy.

658
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,925
Group picture.
Group picture.

659
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,429
Everybody say cheese.

660
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:52,555
-Cheese...
- Cheese.

661
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,966
- ... omelet.
- Cheese omelet.

662
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,421
Woo.
Spoiler alert.

663
00:36:58,446 --> 00:37:00,172
- Hello.
- Jump!

664
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,609
- I am famish... Whoa.
- It's chow time!

665
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:17,860
Yuck.

666
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,608
Hanging tough through thick and thin.

667
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,364
Yeah!

668
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,030
Ow!

669
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,177
What?

670
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:38,022
What the heck?

671
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,593
Who invited you to move in?

672
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,967
Hey! Whoa!
That's my toothbrush.

673
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,292
Get it out!

674
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:46,906
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

675
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,773
Huh?

676
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,223
Alright, class.
Thought for the day.

677
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:02,164
"Water is the softest thing,

678
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:06,129
yet it can penetrate
mountains and earth.

679
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:08,067
Here's my thought of the day,
"When are we done?"

680
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,341
Aw.
Red.

681
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:13,590
What the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

682
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:17,419
Can I just say, I never understand
a single thing you are talking about.

683
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:26,330
Wow, that's very life like.

684
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,407
Ah...!
Ha ha!

685
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,508
- Woo. Ho ho ho.
- So deep.

686
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:33,142
And Terence, let's see your...

687
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,236
Oh, my goodness.

688
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,884
I did not know
you felt that way.

689
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:40,155
Uh.
Class dismiss.

690
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,127
And now, we've come
to the prestigious Palm Cistern.

691
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,551
Where birds of all feathers
flock together

692
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,957
for the 8 kinds of
fruit and nut trees.

693
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:51,411
Suck those bellies in.
Instaham!

694
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:53,913
Hmm.
Is that what I think it is?

695
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:57,090
That's an egg.
That's how our children are born.

696
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,705
You guys don't lay eggs?

697
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,962
Aye.
Wished we did.

698
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:06,868
Enchanté.

699
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:12,578
You look delicious, my dear.

700
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,798
That's us.

701
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,665
Hey! Hello!
Excuse me. Buddy?

702
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,861
Those are fragile.

703
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:34,761
Maybe you shouldn't pick them up, alright?
Not yours.

704
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,792
Oh.
My friend from the banquet.

705
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:40,532
Now that's a very good painting.
Very good.

706
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:41,718
Oh.
Yeah uh.

707
00:39:41,743 --> 00:39:45,869
The assignment was, "Paint your pain."
So I... painted your pain.

708
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:48,090
It's actually the first
in a series.

709
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:49,562
- Here you go.
- Uh-huh.

710
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,210
- This one is nice.
- Oh.

711
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,973
I call this one, "Ketosis."

712
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,824
And, oh, I call this one,
"Bye bye."

713
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,451
Wonderful likeness.

714
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:02,359
I thought you said you stored
your nuts for winter

715
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:04,475
- Ha ha ha...
- Burn.

716
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,717
Alright, what's going on here?

717
00:40:05,742 --> 00:40:07,874
Are you explorers
or are you staying?

718
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:11,129
Because if you are explorers, then
why are there more of you coming, huh?

719
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,237
Hi there, everybody!

720
00:40:15,353 --> 00:40:19,058
Not my house again.
Tha-That's my home.

721
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,584
And you know what?
If you are staying,

722
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,589
why don't you just say so?
And why did you leave your home?

723
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:24,851
How do we know you're not
fugitives of the law?

724
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:27,381
You are making our guests
feel unwelcome.

725
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:29,503
And you're not asking
basic questions!

726
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:33,386
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Your opinion is not needed!

727
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:34,554
Why do we have to agree?

728
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,136
Why does it matter that
we're not the same?

729
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:39,386
Anger, is not always the answer!

730
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:40,865
Continue the tour.

731
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,712
Umm.
Surfs up, you guys.

732
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:46,249
- So, get ready to hang loose.
- That went well, if you're me.

733
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:47,563
Ha ha ha...

734
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:48,998
Dummy.

735
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:55,829
We could really use you
right about now.

736
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,006
Wait.
Actually...

737
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,968
Hey, Chuck.
It's Red, zip on down here.

738
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:07,289
Oh. Hey, Chuck's mom,
can your son come out to play?

739
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,442
All of this, does not
just happen on it's own.

740
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,582
BOMB'S
SHELTER

741
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:18,527
Oh, hey.
Just taking a shower.

742
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,610
- Bomb, buddy, TMI.
- Ah ha ha!

743
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:24,344
Now, I'm telling you.
Something isn't kosher with these pigs.

744
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:26,891
And it's up to us
to figure it out.

745
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,472
Figure what out exactly?

746
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:30,292
I don't know.
Maybe they are just being innovative.

747
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:32,897
- Go ahead.
- All aboard.

748
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,642
It does seem a little odd though.

749
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:40,164
- Weee!
- Nailed it.

750
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,909
Flawless.

751
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,992
Come on. Does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

752
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:48,041
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to,

753
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,285
- Hey!
- it's Mighty Eagle.

754
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,619
MIGHTY EAGLE!

755
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,175
Oh yeah.

756
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:07,015
Take that, tree.

757
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,891
Eat my foot.

758
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,769
Tasty.
Yum yum yum.

759
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:16,434
Whoa.

760
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:19,402
MIGHTY EAGLE!

761
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,172
Peek-a-boo.

762
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,904
Hello, Bird Island!

763
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:33,113
Mighty Eagle xo
- Heh heh, you're welcome.

764
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:36,754
- Does Mighty Eagle still live?
- Did he ever lived.

765
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:38,393
And if he did live,
where would he live?

766
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:41,254
By the Lake of Wisdom
in the ancient tree.

767
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:42,437
It's a fairy tale.

768
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:45,074
I've run all over this island,
where could that possibly be?

769
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,503
Way up high.

770
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:53,319
It's a long up that mountain,
and if I'm being honestly...

771
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:55,434
Well. I mean, you know,
I can kind of use your help.

772
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,153
What's that?
What are you trying to say?

773
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:59,899
Nothing. I was just saying that I can
you know, I can use your help.

774
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,345
Oh. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite
hear you over your ego.

775
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:04,340
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit.

776
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:05,763
I need your help!

777
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:08,573
Oh.
Why didn't you say so?

778
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:11,714
- Bomb?
- Let's... do it!

779
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:16,080
Oh gosh.

780
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:17,892
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

781
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,535
well, how come we don't
ever hear his battle cry?

782
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,688
- I don't know.
- Maybe we have.

783
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,295
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

784
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,657
You know what?
I think I got an idea.

785
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,548
Maybe it's something like...

786
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,279
No!
That's more like...

787
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:36,305
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

788
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,574
Oh, I got one.

789
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,901
Not bad.
It's a good impression.

790
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:47,491
But, in my head, I'm kind of
imagining something more like a...

791
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:55,772
That sounds about right.

792
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:57,923
No. I'm thinking it maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

793
00:43:57,948 --> 00:44:00,593
Like a little bit,
just more majestic like...

794
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,672
- I'm cAlling for yOu!
- I'm coming foR You so OpeN your door!

795
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,527
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

796
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:23,529
It's like running a nursery.
Absolute childcare.

797
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:27,496
Someone has anger issues.

798
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:35,841
This uh.
This is the wrong mountain.

799
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:39,655
My calves are killing me.

800
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,385
Aw!

801
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,293
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

802
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:10,889
That is simply unreal.

803
00:45:10,914 --> 00:45:13,072
The Lake of Wisdom.

804
00:45:16,654 --> 00:45:19,030
What are you guys waiting for?

805
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,453
Guys, hurry up!

806
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,207
This is what Mama talked about.

807
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,875
Wow.

808
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:36,103
Ah. Be honest.
Do I sound any wiser?

809
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:37,894
Oh, way wiser.

810
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,113
You were kind of dumb before,
I can say that now.

811
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:41,891
That water is no joke.

812
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:45,461
I can literally taste the
intelligence and wisdom...

813
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:48,240
- ... circulating through my body now.
- Hey, guys. Nobody's here.

814
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:51,012
I mean, nobody's used
this place in years.

815
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:53,951
What are you doing?

816
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,465
Get out of there!

817
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:04,901
Aww.

818
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:08,048
Don't spit in his mouth!

819
00:46:08,073 --> 00:46:10,416
No, don't spit it back!

820
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:12,524
Uh, don't swallow it.

821
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:15,021
Ew.
Ack.

822
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:25,112
Whoa!

823
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:28,853
Get out. Let's go.
Come on.

824
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:31,043
Shh, shh, Bomb.
Take your time, will you.

825
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,676
Red.
I found the meaning of life.

826
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:34,987
- It's...
- Shut your worm hole!

827
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:58,793
Oh, wow, it's him.

828
00:47:23,363 --> 00:47:25,070
Oh man.

829
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:37,006
No, no, no.
Ack!

830
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:41,145
 Horrible turn of events, horrible.

831
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:57,747
Well.

832
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:00,823
Not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Wizz.

833
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:04,381
Did you just come here
to look at me?

834
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:08,096
Or did you have
something to say?

835
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,448
- I think he saw us.
- Oh, you think so?

836
00:48:12,695 --> 00:48:15,453
You have passed the first test!

837
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,254
You have found me.

838
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,494
- Whoa!
- Look out. Whoa!

839
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:22,326
Behold.
Gaze upon.

840
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:26,639
Mighty Eagle!

841
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:33,508
I see all and know all.

842
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:35,858
- What are your names?
- If you know all,

843
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,740
why don't you know where we are?

844
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:38,778
Ow!

845
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:41,204
I know very well
who you are.

846
00:48:41,229 --> 00:48:46,200
You are lost souls, who have
come here, seeking wisdom.

847
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:48,455
- Whoa!
- Can we have some?

848
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,547
Wisdom is not something
that is given.

849
00:48:52,572 --> 00:48:55,675
It is something that is...
attain.

850
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,129
Okay.
Goodbye.

851
00:48:57,154 --> 00:49:00,477
No no no...
Will I help you attain wisdom?

852
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,109
- Whoa! Ha ha!
- Yes!

853
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:04,155
That, I will do.

854
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,754
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

855
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,790
- Prepare!
- Okay.

856
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:12,100
... to have your minds Blown.

857
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,678
Aw!
Son of a...

858
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:15,844
This guy is good.

859
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,148
Welcome, to the Hall of Heroism.

860
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:22,001
Wow.
It's really amazing to meet you.

861
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,988
You know, I actually
have your poster up uh...

862
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:28,372
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sprinkle of those trophies.

863
00:49:28,397 --> 00:49:30,018
How many?
I have no idea.

864
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:32,013
Countless, I'm sure.
13.

865
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:35,252
Wow. This is way nicer than
my Hall of Wimpiness.

866
00:49:35,277 --> 00:49:37,768
Bring it home, mamacita.

867
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:40,545
Get out of town.
Ha ha ha ha!

868
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,114
What the?

869
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,201
Those are some
old school moves there.

870
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:53,932
Yeah.

871
00:49:58,127 --> 00:49:59,271
What?

872
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,616
...
Wow.

873
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,422
YES!

874
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:03,591
Yeah.

875
00:50:06,497 --> 00:50:08,206
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.

876
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:10,751
That, you know,
it doesn't mean he's not wise.

877
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:16,371
Hey. Are you tired of filling
your balloons with heavy old air?

878
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,579
Finally, there's a better way.

879
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:19,795
- Helium.
- Helium.

880
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,578
It's a gas.

881
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:23,916
Aw.
Don't worry about your balloon.

882
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:27,890
It will just land in the ocean.
The fish love it.

883
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:30,293
It's good for their tummy.

884
00:50:33,707 --> 00:50:35,426
Free party.
Free party.

885
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,507
It's going to be the
piggiest party of the year.

886
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:40,865
Party!
Get a bird sitter.

887
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,496
Let's go, piggies.

888
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:45,230
Well now, that,
is some fine handy work.

889
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:47,403
- Hey, judge, you're under arrest.
- What?

890
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:49,085
For looking too good.

891
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,336
Hello.
What about me?

892
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,143
Do I get a plus one?
Oh! Thank you.

893
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:54,771
Let me see.
Let me see.

894
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:57,458
Ah-choo!
Oh, that was a wet one.

895
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,003
- Ooo.
- Ooo.

896
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:09,208
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

897
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,762
Almost there.
Don't rush me.

898
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:16,276
- Oop. Slow down there.
- Deep breath. Deep breath.

899
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,254
And we're back.
And now...

900
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:20,971
Who's ready for trust falls?

901
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:22,716
- I got you.
- No no no no no.

902
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:30,613
Mighty Mighty Eagle soaring free.

903
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:35,128
Defender of our homes and liberty.

904
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:39,703
Bravery, humility, and honesty.

905
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,696
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

906
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:46,225
Uhh.
Yeah.

907
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,850
- Yes, we did.
- Um. Right. Yeah.

908
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:56,473
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, rescue me.

909
00:51:56,498 --> 00:51:58,706
Now you do the second verse.

910
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:00,891
- Uh. I.. I...
- Come on.

911
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,624
- Me?
- Yes.

912
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:05,356
Do it.

913
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:09,386
- Mighty, Mighty Eagle flap your wings.
- Oh yeah!

914
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:13,047
And fill up your big cave
with all your fancy things.

915
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:13,957
That's it.

916
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:16,377
- Politeness, Good sportsmanship.
- That's no me.

917
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:18,397
- and the long attention span.
- What?

918
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:22,653
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, yeah.

919
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:24,478
Take it away, Charles.

920
00:52:24,503 --> 00:52:28,467
Oh great heroic Mighty Eagle.

921
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,918
With finer plumage

922
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:34,078
- ... than a sea gull.
- Oh, sing it.

923
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,891
Uh.
Ambidexterity, pottery,

924
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,201
- ... and bankruptcy
- Ouch.

925
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:46,601
Mighty, Mighty Eagle...
Harmonize. Harmonize.

926
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:52,077
- Rescue me.
- Rescue me.

927
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:59,569
Wow.
You know it better than me.

928
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:03,748
So, anyway, the other day,
these pigs showed up out of nowhere.

929
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:06,342
And, it caused me
a great deal of suspicion.

930
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,788
And he's walking
out of the room.

931
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:10,402
Unbelie...
I don't get this.

932
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:12,381
This guy sits here on
his butt, all alone.

933
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,889
clearly doesn't leave the house.

934
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:17,093
He talk's a good game, but, he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

935
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:18,717
Sounds a lot like you.

936
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:21,904
Oh good.
Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

937
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,016
Well, hello.

938
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,518
- Hello. Mighty Eagle.
- What?

939
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,104
- What are you doing?
- Uh.

940
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:33,871
- I am bird watching.
- What?

941
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:36,010
- Ah.
- Take a peek.

942
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,376
- Oh you're disgusting
- Oh yeah.

943
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:43,417
Look.
Are you gonna help us or not?

944
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:45,798
- I am helping you!
- No. This is you helping.

945
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:48,183
Looking through binoculars.
Spying on old ladies.

946
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,931
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

947
00:53:51,045 --> 00:53:52,769
Wait.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

948
00:53:53,804 --> 00:53:56,545
Oh my.

949
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:59,280
Huh!
I was right.

950
00:53:59,305 --> 00:54:00,886
I was right.
I knew it!

951
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:02,671
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up!
Get out here!

952
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:03,777
Oh oh.

953
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:06,813
Mighty Eagle, hey.
Fly us down there, now.

954
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,936
- No.
- I'm sorry. What?

955
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,280
I don't do that anymore.
I'm retired.

956
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:16,728
Mostly just tired.

957
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,943
Go handle it yourself.

958
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:21,127
This is everything
I've prepared you for.

959
00:54:21,152 --> 00:54:22,760
What?
Prepared us for?

960
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:24,111
Hold on.
Did I missed something?

961
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:26,046
Let me just go through
my notes really quick. Let's see.

962
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:28,540
Crazy stuff, bragging,
crazy stuff, karaoke.

963
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,100
No. See, I don't see
anything useful here.

964
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:34,398
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

965
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:36,006
Yes, it is.

966
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,003
- So, off you go.
- Hey. You know what?

967
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:41,973
I used to believe in you.

968
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:46,293
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

969
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:47,906
because you were here.

970
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:52,089
And now I see the fate of
the world hangs on idiots like me.

971
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:56,073
And that, sir,
is sort of terrifying.

972
00:54:56,616 --> 00:54:58,522
It's time for you to go.

973
00:54:58,547 --> 00:55:01,957
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly.

974
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:03,955
And you're too afraid to do it.

975
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,734
- Huh!
- Huh?

976
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:08,081
Hey, guys. Come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

977
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:10,286
So, uh, I'm having
a party next Tuesday.

978
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,717
Could you just
do a little pop in?

979
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:19,596
Come on, run faster!

980
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:20,583
- Whoa!
- Ah!

981
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,480
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Whoa!

982
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,413
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

983
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:30,372
- Woo!
- Yeah!

984
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:31,913
- Woo.
- Woo.

985
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:33,864
I love this song.

986
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:42,368
I sentence you all
to 4 hours of hard partying.

987
00:55:44,697 --> 00:55:46,359
Watch out below!

988
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,543
- Huh?
- Huh?

989
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:51,140
- Huh! They're taking the eggs!
- Follow them.

990
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:53,593
Gangway!

991
00:55:57,443 --> 00:55:59,290
Oh man.

992
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:12,732
Right on time. Excellent.
Ah ha ha... !

993
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,837
Chuck, go shut
that party down, now!

994
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:17,913
Ee. But I only know
how to get party started.

995
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,240
- Go!
- On it.

996
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:21,623
- Bomb, we got to stop them.
- Yeah!

997
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:28,511
Got to get more speeeeed!

998
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,109
Ah!
Whoa!

999
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:33,600
It's Chuck time!

1000
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:36,091
Get to the ship!

1001
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:41,413
Eggs.

1002
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:48,882
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1003
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,360
Matilda, we need your help.

1004
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:54,404
- The pigs are stealing our eggs!
- What?

1005
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:57,227
- I'm airborne!
- We have to get back to the village!

1006
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:57,916
Whoa!

1007
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:01,050
Stop dancing and start running!

1008
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:03,870
Huh!
Hors d'oeuvres, my weakness.

1009
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:06,419
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1010
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,619
- We got to get the eggs off the ship!
- Yeah, let's go!

1011
00:57:08,644 --> 00:57:10,143
- Is everyone on board?
- Let's go. Let's go!

1012
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:12,233
Use the trampolines!

1013
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,070
Can you get up there?

1014
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:16,625
We got an intruder!

1015
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,173
What the heck are they doing?

1016
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:20,349
Untie the ropes.
Drop the eggs in the water.

1017
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:23,983
Get rid of them.
Get him off of there.

1018
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:26,486
It's too strong,
I can't break it.

1019
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:29,099
Huh!
Bomb, blow off the chain.

1020
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:31,041
Knock them down!

1021
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,049
Come on, Bomb.
You can do this.

1022
00:57:36,438 --> 00:57:38,017
Come on, Bomb.
You got this.

1023
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:40,140
- Blow up.
- You got to get me mad.

1024
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,004
Okay. Well then,
what makes you mad?

1025
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,751
Try insulting me
on a personal level.

1026
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:47,429
Oh, oh, uh.
Your poetry stinks!

1027
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:49,715
You're just a bad poet.
And you know it!

1028
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,334
Oh. I know.
I know!

1029
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,825
Hey.
Who wants a birdie bath?

1030
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:04,761
Oh. I'm sorry, Red.
I couldn't do it.

1031
00:58:04,786 --> 00:58:06,597
Don't give up.
This isn't over!

1032
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,189
Thanks for your hospitality.

1033
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:12,181
- Ha ha ha... !
- Yeah.

1034
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:15,409
Set sail for Piggy Island!

1035
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:21,916
- Huh!
- Huh!

1036
00:58:34,088 --> 00:58:37,449
<font color="#ff8080">WORLD MAP
BIRD ISLAND</font>

1037
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,151
Huh!
Oh no!

1038
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,901
We'll find them

1039
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:53,124
Oh.
Oh.

1040
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:57,087
Oh.
They're all gone.

1041
00:58:57,514 --> 00:58:59,120
<font color="#ff8040">DAYCARE</font>

1042
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:02,511
Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1043
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:10,871
Mr. Red!

1044
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:18,733
What do we do now?

1045
00:59:19,316 --> 00:59:20,921
Wait, hold on.
You're asking me?

1046
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:23,863
You knew.
You try to tell us.

1047
00:59:23,888 --> 00:59:26,085
But we didn't listen.

1048
00:59:26,243 --> 00:59:29,304
I didn't hear

1049
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:31,926
Red, we need a leader.

1050
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:33,642
- What do we do now?
- What do we do?

1051
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,902
Wait a minute.
I'm not a leader.

1052
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:38,001
Okay. Pigs stole our kids.
That sucks.

1053
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:41,310
Made all you guys looked like idiots.
You know what we got to do?

1054
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:44,273
We start replacing those kids.

1055
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:47,060
Ladies, get busy!

1056
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,184
We're going to be laying
some eggs tonight!

1057
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:51,013
No. No, stop.
No no no...

1058
00:59:51,038 --> 00:59:53,011
We're not going to
replace those kids.

1059
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:56,056
- We're gonna get them back.
- How are we going to do that?

1060
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:58,758
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1061
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,899
That, is where they went!

1062
01:00:00,924 --> 01:00:03,334
And, so that,
is where we are going!

1063
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,505
But how do we get from here
to there?

1064
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,498
I'm not aquatic,
in the least.

1065
01:00:07,523 --> 01:00:09,815
Well.
You know

1066
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,573
We're gonna build our own boat.

1067
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,040
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

1068
01:00:13,065 --> 01:00:14,829
They stole your kids.

1069
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:18,949
No. They stole our kids.
I mean, who does that?

1070
01:00:18,974 --> 01:00:21,518
Have you ever stolen
any one's children?

1071
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:23,896
Huh?
Have you?

1072
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:25,983
I mean, you look like you would.

1073
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:28,651
And you know what?
I'm a little bit angry.

1074
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:31,436
Correction.
I'm really angry.

1075
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,495
And I don't think
I'm the only one.

1076
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,080
Come on, we're birds!
We're descendants from dinosaurs!

1077
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:39,878
We're not supposed to be nice!
Right?

1078
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:46,474
Uh.
Yeah, point-point made.

1079
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:47,995
- Who else here is angry?
- I! -I!

1080
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,176
- I am.
- Yeah, you are!

1081
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:52,936
We're getting our kids back,
and I don't need any

1082
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:55,807
- ... calm, detach, happy birds.
- No.

1083
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,805
Not going to help us.
Don't need it.

1084
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,444
I need some angry flocking birds.

1085
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:03,299
You hear me!
Now, who's angry!

1086
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,686
- Yeah!
- Angry!

1087
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:06,331
Well, let's go!

1088
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:08,892
Bring me everything that floats.

1089
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:10,786
Yeah. Yeah.
That's perfect, yeah.

1090
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,751
With every single feather
of my being,

1091
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:27,387
I am not going to let any of these
eggs be taken from their parents.

1092
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:38,093
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1093
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:39,447
You got it.

1094
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,758
- Done, and done.
- Uh. A little help here?

1095
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,461
Let's go!
Move it, everybody!

1096
01:01:44,486 --> 01:01:46,363
- Push with your upper body.
- Put your back into it.

1097
01:01:46,388 --> 01:01:49,174
I have no upper body!

1098
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,572
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1099
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:54,750
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yay!

1100
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:05,445
Go Leonard!

1101
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:08,740
When I say, "Eat the".
You say, "eggs."

1102
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:12,149
- Eat the.
- Eggs!

1103
01:02:12,174 --> 01:02:14,049
Wow, what a reception.

1104
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:16,617
Alright, snouts up!

1105
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:21,928
My, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1106
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:28,070
Welcome home,
King Mudbeard!

1107
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:34,445
My father, and my father's father,
and my weird Aunt Chloe,

1108
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:36,702
have all searched for the eggs.

1109
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:38,830
But only I,

1110
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:42,133
- King Mudbeard, have found them.
- Oh. My pom-poms.

1111
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:45,628
I present to you,
the EGGS!

1112
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,076
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1113
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,900
- A feast!
- Huh!

1114
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:55,196
I proclaim a feast!
2 nights heads.

1115
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:56,541
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1116
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:57,966
- I ♥ cholesterol!
- Let's EAT.

1117
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,990
Let's go make some omelets!

1118
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:12,307
Oh. I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1119
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,644
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

1120
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,689
Uh. Anybody else got
butterflies in the stomach?

1121
01:03:18,714 --> 01:03:19,731
Yeah.

1122
01:03:19,756 --> 01:03:22,232
Probably because you ate
too many caterpillars.

1123
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:26,908
Drop your nuts
and move your butts!

1124
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,354
Come on, let's go!

1125
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,049
- Oh no.
- Whoa.

1126
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,928
I wasn't expecting this.

1127
01:03:43,775 --> 01:03:45,503
Well.
Hold on a second.

1128
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,722
That guy is the king?

1129
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:50,478
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1130
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:52,488
- What the heck is a castle?
- And that's where we're going.

1131
01:03:52,513 --> 01:03:56,026
Hey, guys. Do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1132
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:57,149
- Yep.
- Nope.

1133
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:59,307
- What class?
- Well, forget all of it for now.

1134
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:01,131
Now it's time to let loose.

1135
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:03,040
Oh good.
Because I never learn anything anyway.

1136
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:04,852
Oh, me neither.
I actually just came to socialize.

1137
01:04:04,877 --> 01:04:06,196
I came for the snacks.

1138
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,365
You don't happen to have
any of it now, do you?

1139
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,404
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH.

1140
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,940
How are we going to
get over those walls?

1141
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:14,264
Uh.

1142
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:18,487
I'll tell you how.
We're gonna fly.

1143
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:20,735
Remember.
The goal is the castle.

1144
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,548
Get to the castle.
Who wants to go first?

1145
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:24,906
- Over here!
- I do!

1146
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:27,328
- Me. Me. Me.
- Hey. Alright, Matilda.

1147
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:28,967
Always a brides-space.

1148
01:04:28,992 --> 01:04:31,093
Step right up.
Keep your wings, legs and beak

1149
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:32,656
- inside the slingshot at all times.
- Shoot it!

1150
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:34,841
Okey-doke.
Fire!

1151
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:39,785
And one,
and a whoa...

1152
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,121
Take that, porkers!

1153
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:43,147
Incoming!

1154
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:45,969
Boom, baby, boom!

1155
01:04:45,994 --> 01:04:48,827
Well, how about that? My teacher
can shoot fireballs out of her butt.

1156
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,328
You, what's your name?
Hal?

1157
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,859
I've seen you do something
strange before, right?

1158
01:04:51,884 --> 01:04:52,866
Well, let's see.

1159
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:56,328
- I'm really good at...
- It doesn't matter. Launch him.

1160
01:04:57,048 --> 01:04:58,929
Oh, this guys looks good.

1161
01:04:58,954 --> 01:05:00,661
He's gonna make it.

1162
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:04,436
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1163
01:05:04,461 --> 01:05:05,929
No, he's coming back.

1164
01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:07,121
- He's coming, duck.
- Whoa whoa whoa...

1165
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:08,811
Get down.
DUCK!

1166
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:10,499
Whoa whoa whoa...

1167
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:12,404
Uh.
Did we win?

1168
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:14,142
Uh, no.
Not quite yet, buddy.

1169
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,290
Uh, we're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1170
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:19,533
- Medic!
- Alright. Who's up next!

1171
01:05:19,558 --> 01:05:21,222
Whoa whoa whoa...
What can you do?

1172
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:23,113
Ah-choo!

1173
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:26,467
- Uh... Yuck.
- Uh, need a tissue?

1174
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:35,545
Calvin Swine.

1175
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,042
Who's next?
We need flyers, not standbyers!

1176
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,395
Let's go!

1177
01:05:39,553 --> 01:05:42,491
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1178
01:05:42,516 --> 01:05:43,512
Yeah!

1179
01:05:43,537 --> 01:05:45,319
Oh my gosh!

1180
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,925
We're having a feast.
We're eating the eggs.

1181
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:51,477
Going to have a big feast.
Going to eat all the eggs.

1182
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:53,616
Huh?
What?

1183
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,494
- What is that?
- Whoa!

1184
01:05:58,985 --> 01:06:00,115
Fire!

1185
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,078
That guy again.

1186
01:06:02,103 --> 01:06:04,712
HAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
- Citizens of Pig Island.

1187
01:06:04,737 --> 01:06:07,756
If you spot any birds
destroying your neighbourhood,

1188
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:10,624
- please capture them.
- What did he say?

1189
01:06:10,648 --> 01:06:15,392
There's been a change of plan.
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1190
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:18,274
Did he say eat the eggs?

1191
01:06:29,187 --> 01:06:31,691
Okay. I want you to curl up
into a little ball, alright?

1192
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:34,382
- Make yourself aerodynamic.
- Like this?

1193
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,904
To the left!
To the left!

1194
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:37,841
- Let me at em!
- Launch!

1195
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:44,223
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1196
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:48,512
- Get him!
- Heat pile. Hog pile.

1197
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,483
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME!

1198
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,663
Wow, that blows.
Uh, in a good way.

1199
01:06:54,688 --> 01:06:56,339
- To the left!
- Oh. Hold on, wait.

1200
01:06:56,364 --> 01:06:57,945
My left of your left?

1201
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:01,305
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1202
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,427
Right.
Good call.

1203
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:05,492
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1204
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:07,894
- I got this you guys.
- Alright.

1205
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,006
She got far,
but not far enough.

1206
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:30,458
- Get her out of our town!
- Oh oh.

1207
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:32,957
We have to get closer.

1208
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:37,707
Judge power!

1209
01:07:40,678 --> 01:07:42,605
Trial by fire!

1210
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:46,105
No, literally he's on fire right now.
Can somebody please help him?

1211
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,567
Mighty Eagle!

1212
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:09,705
Terence.
I got an idea.

1213
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,054
Do you think you can pull
the slingshot back far enough

1214
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,027
to hit that giant boulder?

1215
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:17,486
Okay. Launch me right towards
the top of that thing.

1216
01:08:20,466 --> 01:08:22,033
Ready.

1217
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:25,630
Red, I'm not going to lie to you.
I am...

1218
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:27,904
... going to miss you
when you die.

1219
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:31,049
Rest in peace, my friend.
Rest in peace.

1220
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,325
Hey, guys.
Let's not get cheesy, okay?

1221
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,626
Ready.
Fire!

1222
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,165
This is gonna hurt.

1223
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:48,115
What was that?
Huh?

1224
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:50,568
- My roof!
- Oh oh.

1225
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,901
- Did he make it?
- I hope he's okay.

1226
01:08:54,073 --> 01:08:57,835
- I'm in!
- Yeah. I knew he would make it.

1227
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:01,551
Send everyone else!

1228
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:05,238
Guards!
There's a red bird in these walls.

1229
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:06,936
Bring him to me.

1230
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:09,068
- Aye aye, sir.
- Roger that, boss.

1231
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:12,794
Not in these walls.

1232
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,927
In the castle!
Come on, you guys.

1233
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:17,804
Here, pretty bird.
Here, pretty bird.

1234
01:09:21,216 --> 01:09:23,817
Transport the eggs!

1235
01:09:28,942 --> 01:09:30,285
<font color="#ff8080">NO EGGS
IN HERE</font>

1236
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:33,614
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...!

1237
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:37,956
I wasn't ready!
Uh, faster!

1238
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:54,662
Chuck, is that you?

1239
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:57,073
Is this the house of horrors?

1240
01:09:57,098 --> 01:09:59,187
I got to be honest.
You look a little... fine.

1241
01:09:59,212 --> 01:10:02,442
- You look fine, come on.
- Bomb's on his way.

1242
01:10:07,854 --> 01:10:09,502
Ouchy.

1243
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:13,081
Ah! Ha!
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1244
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:14,654
What is that?

1245
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,739
My loyal subjects.

1246
01:10:17,771 --> 01:10:20,881
The treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1247
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:23,731
with an unprovoked act of aggression!

1248
01:10:23,756 --> 01:10:25,886
The attack will fail!

1249
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:30,715
We have glass! We have wood!
We have TNT.

1250
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:35,035
We tried to kill them with kindness
and now we're just gonna have to...

1251
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,096
Well, you know.

1252
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:38,885
Run!

1253
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:42,558
Who's gonna go next?

1254
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:50,353
Aim for that ram.

1255
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:51,536
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1256
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:56,571
- Terence.
- Terence.

1257
01:10:56,706 --> 01:10:58,128
Get them!

1258
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:03,673
- No.
- What happened?

1259
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:09,212
No eggs in here.
No. Nope. No. No.

1260
01:11:09,237 --> 01:11:11,527
Hey! Whoa.
I'm on this.

1261
01:11:13,559 --> 01:11:15,590
Redrum.

1262
01:11:15,616 --> 01:11:18,178
Uh.
Never mind.

1263
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:21,967
Backup engine.

1264
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:28,341
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Wait. Hold on a second.

1265
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,059
Wait, I know that rear end.
That's Bomb.

1266
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:32,817
Yeah. Chuck, that's not his rear end.
That's his face, man.

1267
01:11:32,849 --> 01:11:34,458
- Sorry, Bomb.
- No problem.

1268
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:36,350
It's a shaky week.

1269
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,744
Thanks for getting me out.

1270
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:44,390
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1271
01:11:45,963 --> 01:11:48,483
He was sick.
But, then he got cured.

1272
01:11:48,873 --> 01:11:52,336
No eggs in... huh!
Ooo, these are clever pigs.

1273
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:54,727
Okay, look. I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1274
01:11:54,752 --> 01:11:57,630
Bomb, you can handle too.
Chuck, I don't know if you can help?

1275
01:11:57,655 --> 01:12:02,378
We got to figure out a way
to get into that room...

1276
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:10,911
<font color="#ff8080">FART
FACE</font>

1277
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:22,912
... room
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1278
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,521
- Uh. Huh?
- You are gonna pay for that.

1279
01:12:31,495 --> 01:12:32,808
What just happened?

1280
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,068
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were saying.

1281
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:37,337
And here we are?

1282
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:39,265
We found them!
Oh oh.

1283
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:41,320
Oh, come on

1284
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,816
- Red!
- Guys, come on!

1285
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:47,380
Quick, follow him.

1286
01:12:47,783 --> 01:12:50,765
Things are looking sunny side up!

1287
01:12:51,103 --> 01:12:53,201
Guys, I'm here.
Everything is going to be okay.

1288
01:12:53,226 --> 01:12:54,691
- We are gonna get you out of here.
- Hurry up, Bomb!

1289
01:12:54,716 --> 01:12:56,015
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

1290
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,993
Don't lose me!

1291
01:12:58,018 --> 01:12:59,755
Goodness, they made a harem!

1292
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,488
Oh boy.

1293
01:13:01,513 --> 01:13:03,472
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1294
01:13:03,497 --> 01:13:07,699
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilize buffet.

1295
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:17,299
Don't hatch now.
Do not hatch now.

1296
01:13:17,324 --> 01:13:19,489
Get that red skank off my eggs.

1297
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:21,501
- Hey!
- Oh man

1298
01:13:21,526 --> 01:13:24,456
- Bomb, are you okay?
- Oh, I've been better.

1299
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:27,752
I'm going to get
a running start!

1300
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:31,877
- It's show time!
- Oh.

1301
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:33,949
Fine.
Boil him too!

1302
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,829
Let's pig out.

1303
01:13:35,854 --> 01:13:38,327
Looks like it's just
you and me, pork belly!

1304
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:39,645
I'll be taking that!

1305
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,818
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

1306
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:48,084
- Hey? Oh.
- No!

1307
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:53,344
- We're coming.
- Deep breath.

1308
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:01,003
Ow! I'm in!
Classy joint.

1309
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:02,785
- HELLO!
- Huh!

1310
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:06,050
- Where is everyone?
- Mighty Eagle. Where's he going?

1311
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:08,398
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1312
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,031
Oh, my battle cry?

1313
01:14:15,468 --> 01:14:17,252
Coming in.
Coming in.

1314
01:14:17,277 --> 01:14:21,315
Mighty Eagle!

1315
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:26,606
Oh oh.

1316
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:28,472
Whoa!

1317
01:14:35,733 --> 01:14:38,140
Mighty-Mighty Eagle.
Might Eagle, wake up, come on.

1318
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:39,411
Oh, that's bad breath.

1319
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:42,788
I can sleep late, Mom.
It's not a school day.

1320
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:46,697
Throw him in the pot too.
I'll have the big turkey.

1321
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:51,060
- Red!
- What!

1322
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:53,078
- Huh!
- Whoa! What did I miss.

1323
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:55,683
- You got to fly those eggs to safety.
- I got this.

1324
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,541
Here we go!

1325
01:15:00,822 --> 01:15:04,715
- Whoa. Whoooaaa.
- Yes! Yes. Yes!

1326
01:15:08,131 --> 01:15:09,351
My eggs!

1327
01:15:09,376 --> 01:15:11,612
- Don't forget Chuck and Bomb.
- Who?

1328
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,997
- Those guys.
- Right. Right.

1329
01:15:15,246 --> 01:15:16,902
Got you.

1330
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:24,766
You're not getting away that easy.

1331
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:29,719
No!

1332
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,248
- Save yourselves.
- Hold on, Red!

1333
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:39,147
- I'm gonna save that egg.
- Red, don't be a hero.

1334
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:41,619
- Red, no.
- No!

1335
01:15:45,217 --> 01:15:46,239
Huh?

1336
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:49,418
- Get out of town, everybody.
- Whoa.

1337
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,706
There's just so many of them,
we're outnumbered.

1338
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:54,576
What?
How many?

1339
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:56,233
Oh, not that many.
Just the right amount really.

1340
01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:58,088
No need to look back.
Just keep flying.

1341
01:15:58,113 --> 01:15:59,771
FASTER!

1342
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:02,703
- I'll take that!
- No, you won't!

1343
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,568
Give me that!

1344
01:16:07,117 --> 01:16:09,465
You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

1345
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,798
Here's a 2 word answer,
"Uh-uh!"

1346
01:16:11,823 --> 01:16:15,030
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1347
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:17,168
- Give me that!
- Not going to happen!

1348
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:18,489
Huh!

1349
01:16:20,036 --> 01:16:21,348
Oh no.

1350
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:24,167
Get out of my way.

1351
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,958
- Every pig for himself.
- I quit!

1352
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:33,101
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1353
01:16:33,126 --> 01:16:36,133
I know what I got to do.
I got to blow up that ram.

1354
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,905
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1355
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,585
I need to stop those planes!

1356
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,576
Remember me, Chuck.
Remember me.

1357
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:45,273
Bomb's away!

1358
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:53,017
- Oh, hi there.
- Here, chicky chicky chicky.

1359
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:55,232
This little piggy popped!

1360
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,439
This little piggy exploded.

1361
01:16:57,464 --> 01:16:59,841
And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee,

1362
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:02,151
"I want my mother!"

1363
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:07,139
Come on, Bomb,
you can you do this!

1364
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,563
Blow up.
Blow up.

1365
01:17:11,436 --> 01:17:13,794
- Oh oh.
- Ah ha ha ha!

1366
01:17:13,819 --> 01:17:15,975
Oh no.

1367
01:17:16,484 --> 01:17:20,071
Think explosive thoughts.
Surprise parties!

1368
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:22,978
Yoga poses!

1369
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:26,638
PIG CITY AIRPLANES!

1370
01:17:31,143 --> 01:17:34,278
I blew up, on purpose.

1371
01:17:34,411 --> 01:17:36,621
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1372
01:17:36,646 --> 01:17:39,093
- You wrecked my house!
- Your house was ugly!

1373
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:41,094
Well, now we're even.

1374
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:49,306
Strike!

1375
01:17:51,485 --> 01:17:53,281
Run!
Run!

1376
01:17:55,966 --> 01:17:58,061
Guys, look out!

1377
01:17:59,568 --> 01:18:01,609
Everyone, stand back!

1378
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:08,619
Terence?

1379
01:18:08,907 --> 01:18:11,932
Put on your seat belts, everyone.
Trust me.

1380
01:18:16,871 --> 01:18:20,108
Well.
This is dynamite.

1381
01:18:27,048 --> 01:18:28,386
Aw.
There you are.

1382
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:31,319
Not by the hair on
my chinny-chin-chin!

1383
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,296
Delicious bird eggy wiggy.
Ooo.

1384
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:38,814
You can't eat eggs!

1385
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,290
What are you going to do?
I'm a foodie.

1386
01:18:44,326 --> 01:18:46,748
It's over.
You're finished, eyebrows.

1387
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:49,188
Ah ha ha ha...!

1388
01:18:51,516 --> 01:18:55,197
Anger, is not always the answer!

1389
01:18:56,884 --> 01:19:00,344
Well, you know what,
I guess you win.

1390
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:01,834
What?

1391
01:19:02,257 --> 01:19:05,797
That was an awesome plan.
Mind blower.

1392
01:19:06,384 --> 01:19:08,746
Really?
Well, thank you.

1393
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:12,080
You know, a lot of hard work
goes in my sinister plans.

1394
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:13,598
It does.

1395
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,156
No, I mean your plan was great.

1396
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:19,727
But you didn't plan for THIS!

1397
01:19:36,557 --> 01:19:39,469
You have annoyed me
for the last time.

1398
01:19:39,494 --> 01:19:40,811
Yep.

1399
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:42,273
Huh?

1400
01:19:44,911 --> 01:19:46,729
FASTER!

1401
01:19:46,754 --> 01:19:48,751
Whoa!

1402
01:19:58,411 --> 01:20:00,641
Cramp.
Cramp.

1403
01:20:01,252 --> 01:20:03,052
- It's them!
- Look at that.

1404
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:04,718
Are you seeing
what I am seeing?

1405
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:06,536
- It's Mighty Eagle.
- It's him!

1406
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:08,803
Well. This guy looks
nothing like his statue.

1407
01:20:08,828 --> 01:20:11,282
- Honey.
- Our eggs!

1408
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,924
- Are you okay?
- Chuck, my man.

1409
01:20:26,949 --> 01:20:29,362
- Did you see what I did back there?
- Yeah.

1410
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:33,822
Oh.
This egg is a splitting image of you.

1411
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:36,913
There, safe and sound.

1412
01:20:44,012 --> 01:20:45,310
- Oh!
- Huh!

1413
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:47,642
- Where is he?
- Red.

1414
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,149
Where is he?

1415
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:00,260
Huh!

1416
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:02,873
I think he might be dead.

1417
01:21:16,662 --> 01:21:18,752
Daddy!

1418
01:21:18,947 --> 01:21:22,545
- He's alive!
- He's alive!

1419
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,372
Woo-hoo!

1420
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,433
- Oh!
- What?

1421
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:41,971
- Yeah!
- Oh ho ho!

1422
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:43,520
I'm glad you're alive.

1423
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:46,406
I thought you died
or defected to the pig's side.

1424
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:49,290
- Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.
- Oh.

1425
01:21:49,315 --> 01:21:52,170
- It's good to see you guys.
- Come on.

1426
01:21:53,356 --> 01:21:56,580
- Yay!
- Yay!

1427
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:59,222
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Glad you're back!

1428
01:21:59,442 --> 01:22:02,910
- You did it, great job!
- You're the bird!

1429
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,962
Sir.
Ma'am.

1430
01:22:11,216 --> 01:22:13,439
I think these belong to you.

1431
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,154
Oh.
Oh.

1432
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,913
Thank you.

1433
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:26,840
Oh, Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1434
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:28,308
- Who?
- Is he talking to us?

1435
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,709
You learn your lessons well.

1436
01:22:30,734 --> 01:22:32,967
Come on, bring it in.

1437
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:34,676
No.
I'm not the really affectionate type.

1438
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,902
Uh.
Okay

1439
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:39,532
Does it feel like this is
crossing the line, anyone else?

1440
01:22:39,557 --> 01:22:41,768
- Yep.
- No.

1441
01:22:42,006 --> 01:22:44,833
- You're my prize pupils.
- Your prize what?

1442
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:46,655
Ho ho, don't you see?

1443
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,046
I had to make you
lose faith in me.

1444
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:51,555
So you can learn to have
faith in yourself.

1445
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,359
- That's not really how it felt.
- Tell them, Rosie.

1446
01:22:54,384 --> 01:22:56,322
Yeah. I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1447
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:59,636
Oh look, he's blushing.

1448
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,937
I'm not blushing,
I'm just red.

1449
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:09,162
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1450
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,822
Go get him.

1451
01:23:18,847 --> 01:23:20,113
Hoist it up.

1452
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:21,957
Nice.

01:23:34,645 --> 01:23:36,698
Well done indeed.

1458
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:42,611
Wow.
Is that you right there, Red?

1459
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:43,901
Aw, really?
Where?

1460
01:23:43,926 --> 01:23:46,886
No, they didn't have to...
Oh. Yeah.

1461
01:23:46,911 --> 01:23:50,085
That's funny. I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1462
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:52,360
But, you know,
it's nice.

1463
01:23:52,385 --> 01:23:55,682
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1464
01:23:55,707 --> 01:23:58,703
They made him look so much
more handsome than you.

1465
01:23:58,728 --> 01:24:00,992
You know,
back when I was angry.

1466
01:24:01,017 --> 01:24:03,058
That would have
really ticked me off.

1467
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,717
Ah, forget about that.

1468
01:24:04,742 --> 01:24:06,706
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1469
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:08,454
- Let's do it.
- No. Actually I love to go...

1470
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:10,250
... hang out with you guys.
But you know I got this thing.

1471
01:24:10,275 --> 01:24:11,971
And I have another thing
after that thing

1472
01:24:11,996 --> 01:24:14,937
- and there's all these things in a row.
- Would you look at that.

1473
01:24:17,025 --> 01:24:18,688
What the?

1474
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,205

1475
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:44,007
Mr. Red.
Welcome back, to the village.

1476
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,131
Ta-da!

1477
01:25:12,715 --> 01:25:17,359
Mighty Mighty Red
You rescued me.

Defender of our homes and liberty.

1479
01:25:22,419 --> 01:25:27,891
Bravery. Humility. Angery

1480
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:35,535
Mighty Mighty Red
You Rescued Me

1481
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,208
Me...

1482
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:45,013

Lalalaa
Lalalalaaaaaaaaa.

1484
01:25:56,439 --> 01:25:59,105
Oh my gosh.

1485
01:26:07,522 --> 01:26:10,128
How did you guys find
the time to pull this off?

1486
01:26:10,153 --> 01:26:12,374
This is why we went to
go get pedicure, isn't it?

1487
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:14,906
Nope. We got pedicures
because we are worth it.

1488
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:16,934
- I got gels.
- You guys are something else.

1489
01:26:16,959 --> 01:26:19,142
To be honest with you,
I'm going to miss the beach view.

1490
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:20,641
But, so what.
It's still there.

1491
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:23,574
It's just not... right there when
I wake up and look out my window.

1492
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:26,110
Well, you can still look out your
window and see me and Bomb.

1493
01:26:26,135 --> 01:26:27,315
Right.

1494
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:29,358
So you know,
pluses and minuses.

1495
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:31,424
Okay, see you later.

1496
01:26:31,921 --> 01:26:33,218
Oh.

1497
01:26:34,474 --> 01:26:38,336
- Well, this just got awkward.
- That's really insensitive.

1498
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:40,154
Want to go get a bite?

1499
01:26:40,179 --> 01:26:43,034
Forget it, let's just go home.

1500
01:26:46,059 --> 01:26:48,705
Guys, I'm just messing with you.

1501
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:50,365
Get in here!

1502
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:53,335
- Ha ha ha ha! I knew it!
- Let's be roomies.

1503
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,131
Room mates. Boy, I can't wait
to make a chores list.

1504
01:26:56,156 --> 01:26:58,102
- Wait, hold on a second.
- I'll move my nest into the master bedroom.

1505
01:26:58,127 --> 01:26:59,816
- Bomb, you can stay in the guest half.
- No no no...

1506
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:02,380
- Ah! Can we get a bunk nest?
- Oh, this is going to be perfect.

1507
01:27:02,405 --> 01:27:05,098
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Guys... No!

Leonard can't dance.
He's hatching a new plan.

1517
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:40,828
Okay, maybe I'll dance
for just a sec.

1518
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:46,613
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

1519
01:28:46,638 --> 01:28:48,289
