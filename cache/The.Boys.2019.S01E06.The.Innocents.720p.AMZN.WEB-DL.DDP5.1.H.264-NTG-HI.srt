Obviously, a lot of it's temp.

13
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,595
I love it.

If we're airing on TLC

and Little People, Big World.

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,321
But we're not.

18
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,988
'Cause we're not
cheap reality garbage.

19
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,448
Sorry, Courtenay,
I thought, um...

20
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,717
I-I was trying to go for
something a bit more personable,

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,041
- down-to-earth.
- Not this down-to-earth.

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,054
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,038
We here are not
fucking Heidi and Spencer.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,459
We are The Seven, James.

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,960
And why isn't there anything
on Starlight?

26
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,594
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

27
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,632
Where the hell is she?

28
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,135
Has a heavenly body
lost her luster?

29
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,308
Two weeks after
Starlight's shocking appearance

30
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,767
at the Believe Expo...

31
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,347
Social media is still buzzing

32
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,191
about her controversial speech.

33
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,727
Was it a breakdown

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,480
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

35
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,322
my thoughts are with Starlight,

36
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,397
and, uh,
I support her in every way.

37
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,903
What I want to know,
who's that dude

38
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,655
that stuck his (bleep)
in her face?

39
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,946
She should (bleep) that
(bleep)er in the (bleep)hole.

40
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,700
O-kay.

41
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,043
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,040
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

43
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,922
You and me, we have
a Panera gift card to win.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,750
- No distractions. Come on.
- EMCEE: Ah, good one here.

45
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,256
Before joining The Seven,

46
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,797
which hero led
a search-and-rescue team...

47
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,932
- Mm...
- Oh, my God. -...after the 1994

48
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,599
Northridge earthquake?

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,807
Isn't it your job

50
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,177
to know this kind of stuff?

51
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,393
Eh...

52
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,522
- It's Lamplighter.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,703
Yeah, I had
all the trading cards.

54
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,727
Of course you did.

55
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,764
- (chuckles)
- ANTHONY: Hughie?

56
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,395
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

57
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,493
After Gary's store,

58
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,568
we all thought that...

59
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,366
Oh. H-Hi.

60
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,907
Uh, Anthony.

61
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,620
Hughie's best-looking friend
since fourth grade.

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,751
(chuckles)
Hi, I'm Annie.

63
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,957
It's nice to meet you.

64
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,117
You look familiar.

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,705
- Did you go to Kennedy?
- She's, uh,

66
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,750
- new in town.- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

67
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,384
So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

68
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,882
Mmm.

69
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,593
So, uh, Gretchen Scaramucci...

70
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,304
- No, no. (groans)
- ...she was bigger

71
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,314
than all the guys. Like,

72
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,986
André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

73
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:05,135
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

74
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,515
for making a crack
about her girlfriend...

75
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,233
- Oh, you didn't.
- ...Hughie gives her

76
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,283
this Clint Eastwood stare,
like... (grunts)

77
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,148
- (laughs)
- And then, bam, runs,

78
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,744
like Forrest Gump-runs,

79
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,070
five blocks down
into a pet store

80
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,576
where he hides behind
this jumbo bag

81
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,999
of Kibbles 'n Bits
for four hours.

82
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,329
STARLIGHT:
Oh...

83
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,713
I'll be right back.

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,420
(laughing)

85
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,840
WOMAN:
I know it! I know this!

86
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,128
(Anthony exhales)

87
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,523
Surprised to run
into you here, man.

88
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,717
Yeah. Same goes for you.

89
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,007
I've been worried, asshole.

90
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,011
Ever since Robin, you...

91
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,263
you weren't answering
your phone.

92
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,095
Like, for all I knew,
you were chugging Drano.

93
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,602
I'm sorry, man.

94
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,024
Yeah, you should be.

95
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,192
No, really,
I-I should've called.

96
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,770
You think?

97
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,355
I'm okay.

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,610
Really. I-I just...

99
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,533
n-needed a fresh start.

100
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,071
Fresh start?

101
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,035
(chuckles)

102
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,787
Your fresh start
is way out of your league.

103
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,370
Um, you know that, right?

104
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,785
I am aware, yes.

105
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,463
(chuckles)

106
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,052
Annie's great, man.

107
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,457
Live your life.

108
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,165
That's what Robin would want.

109
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,585
(bells dinging)

110
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,325
- WOMAN: Sync mark.
- (beep)

111
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,639
MAN:
We're good.

112
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,484
- You rolling?
- WOMAN: And... action.

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,310
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

114
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,356
He was, uh, an amazing man.

115
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,690
Oh, the old piano.

116
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,921
Every night, Mom would sit here

117
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,155
and she would play some songs
and...

118
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,827
I got to be honest, most of the
time, me and my dad would be...

119
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,116
we'd be making model planes.

120
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,909
I can almost smell
the... silver paint.

121
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,214
(sighs)

122
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,829
I really wish
he'd lived long enough

123
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,335
to see me fly
with the Blue Angels.

124
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,298
That would have blown his mind.

125
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,718
That's me in the middle.

126
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,876
(chuckles)

127
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,965
Love you, Mom, Dad.

128
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,011
(tapping)

129
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,563
Welcome to my bedroom.

130
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,516
The Baseball Hall of Fame,
you might call it.

131
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,887
Hasn't changed a bit.

132
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,813
Oh, there they are, the Tigers.

133
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,192
It's my little team.

134
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,018
I played shortstop.
Of course,

135
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,613
I couldn't show
everything I had.

136
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,278
But... let's just say we, uh...

137
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,607
we-we did a lot of winning.
(chuckles)

138
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,873
This is just, um...

139
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,695
Really just, uh...

140
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,794
It's so special to come back.

141
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,079
Hmm.

142
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,962
Uh, I'm sorry,

143
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,291
why is that there?

144
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,705
PRODUCER:
Sorry?

145
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,304
Who put the fucking blanket
on the bed?

146
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,968
Uh, R-Randy Set-Dec, I think.

147
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,047
Who's Randy Set-Dec?

148
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,301
He's-he's over there.

149
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,552
Randy, why?

150
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,974
You fucking asshole.

151
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,142
- Uh...
- Amateur fuck.

152
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,811
What just happened?

153
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,269
("Big Shot"
by Billy Joel playing)

154
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,106
Samaritan's Embrace,

155
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,528
led by Ezekiel
but bankrolled by Vought,

156
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,358
has been shipping Compound V

157
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,613
to 53 hospitals
across the country

158
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,365
since 1971
and gift wrapping it...

159
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,449
(exhales)

160
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,504
...gift wrapping it

161
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,249
- as polio vaccine.
- Are you telling me

162
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,421
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls

163
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,710
and blessing babies?

164
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,343
Butcher, can you leave God out
of this?

165
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,759
H-Hold on, hold on.
So, no hero was born?

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,390
None of them? They're all just
kids dosed with the blue shit.

167
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,598
I mean, even...

168
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,848
Even fucking Starlight.

169
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,363
Do you think...
do you think they know...

170
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,516
what really happened to 'em?

171
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,935
What about Homelander?

172
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,194
Homelander's a black hole.

173
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,276
Never had any public records
and never will.

174
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,161
However,
every single other Supe...

175
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,868
juiced-up lab rats.

176
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,158
My God.

177
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,371
I'm trying to give

178
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,960
a tremendous fucking TED Talk
here, and this...

179
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,577
Frenchie,
can you control her, please?

180
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,584
I do not control her.

181
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,086
(scoffs)

182
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,588
Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

183
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,169
Well, spot on, M.M.

184
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,384
We got Vought for child
endangerment, drug trafficking,

185
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,385
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

186
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,719
Raynor's gonna love it.

187
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,405
MOTHER'S MILK:
You better hope she does...

188
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,393
(continues indistinctly)

189
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,105
Uh, hi.

190
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,296
- (snarls)
- FRENCHIE: Hughie, no!

191
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,860
(clicking tongue)
No, no, no.

192
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,065
Not if you're attached
to that hand, no.

193
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,329
It's okay. Yeah.

194
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,079
Well, you know,
all of this, uh, it's...

195
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,923
But it's only part
of the story, no?

196
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,419
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

197
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,762
She's not an infant.

198
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,007
And she was injected
in a basement, not a hospital.

199
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,010
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

200
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,353
Well, your feral pixie dream
girl ain't exactly dictating

201
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,309
her fucking memoirs,
is she, Frenchie?

202
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,519
I'm feeling
she's trying to communicate.

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,270
I mean,
she's been doing this for...

204
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,063
Maybe that means something, huh?

205
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,333
Yeah, maybe they're
just fucking chicken scratches.

206
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,227
Let's find out.

207
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,355
Nah, you've been burned.

208
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,861
It's not safe out there for you.

209
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,203
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

210
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,278
(scoffs)

211
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,493
Fantastique.

212
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,543
- All right, I'm off.
- HUGHIE: Okay.

213
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:17,367
I'll just, uh,
keep on Starlight then, right?

214
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,167
Her phone's been tits-up
for a week.

215
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,670
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

216
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,013
No.

217
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,679
But I can, uh... I can check.

218
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,426
All right.

219
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,644
You're with me.

220
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,144
- He is?
- I am?

221
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,686
What, to the CIA lady?

222
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,019
No. We're gonna go
on a little detour.

223
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,276
- You'll love it.
- (patting)

224
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,148
Come on.

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,409
ASHLEY: No, I have
been working with her!

226
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,028
I've been fucking working
with her! I can't believe this.

227
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,036
Who the fuck are you gonna get
to replace me?

228
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,498
I'd like to see
what bitch that is!

229
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,919
You okay?

230
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,919
(chuckles ruefully)

231
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,751
(exhales)

232
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,756
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

233
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,179
because she seems sweet
and a little naive

234
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,862
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

235
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,386
(chuckles)
And then, once she's active,

236
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,850
she stabs you in the back,

237
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,100
gets you kicked out
of the house?

238
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,402
(scoffs)

239
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,538
- I'm sorry. I don't...
- It was

240
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,322
my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

241
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,987
What could go wrong, I thought.

242
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,196
You were playing to your base.

243
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,341
At least I don't have to kiss

244
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,735
your ass anymore.

245
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,331
(knocking)

246
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,082
Come in.

247
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,745
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

248
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,553
You fired Ashley?

249
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,547
It was actually
a mutual decision.

250
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,219
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

251
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,219
and, um, we wished her well.

252
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,641
So, I would like you
to take this

253
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,770
in the constructive spirit
that it is intended.

254
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,728
Okay.

255
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,768
You are a selfish,
arrogant child.

256
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,194
Wow.

257
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,862
Back in Iowa,

258
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,450
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

259
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,857
I did.

260
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,445
She was a rebel.

261
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,870
Didn't take anyone's shit,

262
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,288
didn't play by the rules.

263
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,617
That's what you wanted to be.

264
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,751
That's what American heroes are.

265
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,498
But it's a myth.

266
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,040
I should know,
because I wrote it.

267
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,375
The truth is,

268
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,551
dozens of people in this company

269
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,550
spent hundreds of hours

270
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,682
to create the thing that is you.

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,970
I never asked for that.

272
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,394
Then why don't you burn
the sparkly outfit

273
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,354
and become a cop?

274
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,151
You want to be a superhero.

275
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,190
You want to be famous.

276
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,574
But nobody's famous alone.

277
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:58,412
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

278
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,410
show a little fucking gratitude,

279
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,292
and let us do our job?

280
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,751
No.

281
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,089
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,431
I mean,
I don't mean to be ungrateful.

283
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,677
But... no red carpets,

284
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,600
no reality TV,

285
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,429
and no Noxzema commercials.

286
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,845
And I want my old uniform back.

287
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,855
I'm gonna save people.

288
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,647
Then I think
we may need to reconsider

289
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,071
your position in The Seven.

290
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,200
And I think
that firing an employee

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,450
after she reported
sexual assault on live TV

292
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,333
might tank your stock price.

293
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,462
(sighs) Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

294
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm sorry,
I don't do discretion anymore.

295
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,803
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

296
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,880
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

297
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,386
I just don't know
to whom you're referring.

298
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,809
Oh, I think you know.

299
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,598
I think you've known
for a long time.

300
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,733
Thank you so much for coming,
Starlight.

301
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,573
I have a lot to think about.

302
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,945
(door opens)

303
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,700
(door closes)

304
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,741
(glass breaking)

305
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,582
Okay.

306
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,915
I mean, you take
Tek-Knight's Knightracer?

307
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,171
Had a carbon footprint
the size of a 727.

308
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,303
The thing literally shot fire.

309
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,510
Thanks to me,
now he drives a hybrid.

310
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,721
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

311
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,851
To respect what's, what's
beautiful in the world.

312
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,061
- What's up?
- Hi.

313
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,108
So... everything.

314
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,901
(sighs) So beautiful.

315
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,404
COURTENAY:
Good. Let's reset.

316
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,106
Trash back on the beach, please.

317
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,116
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

318
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,738
All right.

319
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,794
Um, well, we lost my dad
at a young age,

320
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,499
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

321
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,829
so, it was, uh, my older brother
Nathan who,

322
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,955
who pretty much raised me up.

323
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,063
And when I was three, it's like
these guys started shooting

324
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,757
in front of my building

325
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,587
and I outran the damn bullet.
(laughs)

326
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,183
That's kinda how
I figured out...

327
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,528
Can I, can I stop you
right there for a second?

328
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,642
What if we ixnay
the gun violence?

329
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,020
Maybe make it
a click more upbeat?

330
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,139
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,539
NATHAN: All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

332
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,733
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

333
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,824
Set. Go.

334
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,994
♪ Ring the alarm... ♪

335
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,949
Nope. You're off, bro.

336
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,029
Go again.

337
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,275
Go.

338
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,786
Nope. Go.

339
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,157
No.

340
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,794
No?

341
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,250
What is going on with you, man?

342
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
(exhales)

343
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,712
Here comes the A-Train! (grunts)

344
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,715
COURTENAY:
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

345
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,678
What? I don't, uh...

346
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,678
COURTENAY: You guys were
in Teenage Kix together?

347
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,220
You, you heard
she passed away, yeah?

348
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,595
Yeah, they're,
they're saying it was a stroke,

349
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,142
but between you and me,

350
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,056
I think it was probably
a drug overdose.

351
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:19,395
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honor?

352
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,662
I haven't seen her in years,
so, you know...

353
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,541
(elevator bell chimes)

354
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,883
Boy, you're really milking
this thing for all it's worth.

355
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,345
- Excuse me?
- This empowerment act.

356
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,677
I mean, every time
I'm on a red carpet now,

357
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,143
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

358
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,864
But, hey, as long
as you're trending, right?

359
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,646
I know that you might not
get this,

360
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,530
but it's not an act.

361
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,068
I'm just trying to be honest.

362
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,781
Okay. Yeah.

363
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,407
When I was younger,

364
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:15,002
I read your autobiography so
many times that I wore it out.

365
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,460
I had to buy a second one.

366
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,210
I wanted to live my life
exactly like yours.

367
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,594
Because you didn't just break
all the bones

368
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,052
in your right arm
stopping that school bus

369
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,012
from falling off of a bridge,

370
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:32,723
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

371
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,636
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

372
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,765
You really stood for something.

373
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,573
(elevator bell chimes)

374
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,727
But now...

375
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,656
I'm pretty sure that was just
written by the marketing guys.

376
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,785
MAN (on TV):
...hunting for his own food.

377
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,668
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

378
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,957
can reach sizes
of up to 25 feet in length

379
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,132
and over 4,000 pounds.

380
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,511
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

381
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,180
Mon coeur.

382
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,016
Would you like me to change it?

383
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,822
Incroyable.

384
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,027
You talked to me.

385
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,336
- She talked to me.
- That's talking?

386
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,530
Well, she communicated anyway.

387
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,740
- She likes Shark Week, huh?
- I'll call BuzzFeed.

388
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,491
I wonder if she lived
by the water.

389
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,668
You know, you can't fool me.

390
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,129
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

391
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,091
She could be the key to it all.

392
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,012
- That's what you think, huh?
- No, that's not what I think.

393
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,681
Yes, you do. It torments you.
It's okay.

394
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,721
Listen, I got one word for you.

395
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,984
It's a surefire way
to solve this puzzle.

396
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,136
Once and for all.

397
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,395
Tell me.

398
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,597
Mesmer.

399
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,566
Mesmer?

400
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,436
You want help from a Supe?

401
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,613
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

402
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,453
And the enemy of your enemy...

403
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,238
Frenchie, what part of "you're
burned" do you not understand?

404
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,874
Oh, come on. It's a quick trip.

405
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,540
She and I will hide in the van.

406
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,999
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

407
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,878
Boom, bing? Look, I'll tell you
what I can do.

408
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,166
I can... possibly

409
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,884
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

410
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:28,922
Ah, come on.

411
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,005
Best I can do.

412
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,049
You know...

413
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,055
I've seen you eat ice cream.

414
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,097
- Oh, my God.
- Chunky Monkey, I believe.

415
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,811
- Where is this going?
- Well, you know,

416
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,811
you take a spoonful...
a chunk of fudge, perhaps.

417
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,113
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

418
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,817
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

419
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,107
you try to even it out,
which, tragically,

420
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,821
creates a corresponding divot.

421
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,531
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

422
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,412
To consume the entire pint.

423
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,739
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

424
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,115
But you must.

425
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,661
And I tell you why, my friend,

426
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,834
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

427
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,378
And she...

428
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,628
...she's out of order.

429
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,677
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

430
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,349
You don't do it anymore.

431
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,652
- What?
- You know that feeling you get

432
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,896
when you tip your chair back
too far,

433
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,069
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

434
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,647
Yeah?

435
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,362
You used to look like that
all day long.

436
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,952
- (laughs)
- But now look at you,

437
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,117
neck-deep in shit,
cool as a cucumber.

438
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,285
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

439
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,579
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

440
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,085
But I just... I never really got
how that's an insult?

441
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,707
They're flexible,
take a pounding,

442
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,107
and they're
the reason behind, like,

443
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,681
98% of my life decisions.

444
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,296
BUTCHER:
You're doing good, Hughie.

445
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,144
And you're a good cunt.

446
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,234
Well, here we are.

447
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,809
Church?

448
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,364
Seek and ye shall find, me son.

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,610
Come on.

450
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,322
SHEILA:
Uh, some days are harder

451
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,334
than others, obviously, uh...

452
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,498
You know, the other day,

453
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,207
I-I wanted to talk to my friend

454
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,207
about all this, but I couldn't.

455
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,380
That's why this group
is-is so great.

456
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,009
It's so important.

457
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,506
I know it's wrong
to feel angry.

458
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,595
After all, Tek-Knight saved me.

459
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,137
I-I just wish he'd been

460
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,430
a-a little more gentle
with my spine.

461
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,314
LYDIA:
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

462
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,563
Letting go. Moving on.

463
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,320
Seth, you're up.

464
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,487
(Seth clears throat)

465
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,453
Hey... (clears throat)
Hey, everybody.

466
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,373
OTHERS:
Hey, Seth.

467
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,122
Uh, so I'm kind of a writer.

468
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,874
Uh, I work in marketing.

469
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,416
Uh, there's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

470
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,960
but has ice powers.

471
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,713
Ice Princess.

472
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,466
I'm not allowed to say.

473
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,179
Anyway, she, uh,
took a liking to me.

474
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,890
It was heady, man.

475
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,392
Intoxicating.

476
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,194
No one wants to fuck the writer.

477
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,398
Needless to say,
I fell for her, big-time.

478
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,070
(whispering): What kind
of nobber falls for a Supe?

479
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,319
SETH: Anyway, we were, uh,
you know, being intimate,

480
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,624
when she climaxed and
accidentally turned into ice.

481
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,410
Just for a second,

482
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,873
but I was, uh,

483
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,464
still in there,

484
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,341
at negative 346 degrees.

485
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,969
Same temperature
as liquid nitrogen.

486
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,336
As you can imagine, um...

487
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,222
...it snapped off.

488
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,643
(participants gasp)

489
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,653
The crazy thing is,
I still miss her.

490
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:15,107
It's like, that's the cost
of a mortal like me

491
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,149
for being with a god like her.

492
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,284
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

493
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,951
imagine what one would do
if she found out

494
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,831
you'd been lying to her
from the get-go?

495
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,867
LYDIA:
Excuse me.

496
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,707
You have something
you'd like to share?

497
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,668
No, no. A-Apologies.

498
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:36,089
Please do, uh,
continue the Ice Capades.

499
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,509
LYDIA: We don't make
jokes or judgments here.

500
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,839
Why don't you take the talking
stick and tell us your story?

501
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,715
Nah, I'm good.

502
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,933
You know, I've seen guys
like you before.

503
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,394
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

504
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,894
The smirk, the jokes,

505
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,725
it's all a defense mechanism.

506
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,360
But you don't have
to do that here.

507
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,357
This is a safe space.

508
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,650
I said I'm good.

509
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,654
Time to move on.

510
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,074
Go ahead, Seth.
Give him the stick.

511
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,576
(participants gasp)

512
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,997
You, back off,
or I'll shove this stick

513
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,958
where your dick used to be.

514
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,788
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

515
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,586
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they
shat on your mum's best china.

516
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,551
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

517
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:27,513
or broke your dick
just for a laugh?

518
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,268
Where's your fucking rage?!

519
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,769
Your self-respect?!

520
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,404
Sitting here
in your little share circle.

521
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,526
Having a little whinge
and a moan.

522
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,948
Fuck "letting go."

523
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,715
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

524
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,279
going after 'em!

525
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,331
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

526
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,910
(stick clatters)

527
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,575
Supes are all the same.

528
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,334
Every fucking one of 'em.

529
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,341
(door opens and closes)

530
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,219
Uh, he's, um...

531
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,091
Sorry.

532
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,577
Oh, Ms. Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

533
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,651
Yeah, I'm running late.
Can you walk with me?

534
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,976
DEEP: Yeah, sure. Hey, look,
I brought a little present

535
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,982
- for your little guy.
- Ah.

536
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,044
Never, uh, too young to start
saving the world, right?

537
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,398
I'm gonna need you
to make a public apology.

538
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,906
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from The Seven.

539
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,370
- What?
- We are going to be stationing you

540
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,500
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

541
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,418
Okay, okay, look, I-I know,
I know, I know my brain wasn't

542
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,127
in the right place,
but, but my heart was.

543
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,547
And it's just that,
that damn Oceanland.

544
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,439
- They wouldn't let me...
- This is not about the dead dolphin.

545
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,843
This is about Starlight.

546
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,551
Starlight?
What are you... (chuckles)

547
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,091
What about Starlight?

548
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,425
Everybody seems to want to know

549
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,259
who she was referencing
in that speech,

550
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,224
and it is not going away.

551
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,595
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

552
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,813
some of the other women,
speak up.

553
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,574
- So we need to get ahead of it.
- Okay.

554
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,186
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

555
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,404
but can't you just...

556
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,414
you know, handle it?
Like, like you do?

557
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,907
This is the way
we are handling things now.

558
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,254
I'm in full support of women

559
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,591
and their ongoing bravery
in speaking out.

560
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,837
(sighs)

561
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,260
(clears throat) I'm sorry...
let me start that over.

562
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,539
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

563
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,303
Fuck, I'm sorry.

564
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,675
Yeah, let's just cut.
I'm sorry.

565
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,142
MAN:
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

566
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,522
Starlight,
I hope you can forgive me.

567
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,230
- Harder to sell.
- To sell it. Yeah.

568
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,914
- Just a little harder.
- Perfect. Let's do that.

569
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,108
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

570
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,229
by listening. Okay.

571
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,526
I realize that my behavior

572
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,660
has caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

573
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,488
and I sincerely apologize
for this.

574
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,285
Though at the time I believed

575
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,869
that our encounter
was consensual,

576
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,964
I now realize that, um,
I misread the moment...

577
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,460
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

578
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,062
It's my first, uh, movie
with the, uh...

579
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,257
in the Vought Cinematic
Universe, uh, the VCU.

580
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,929
NARRATOR:
New York. The hearts

581
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,717
of seven million men and women
beat inside this city.

582
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,102
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

583
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,480
and read their minds.

584
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,017
This man is the rapist.

585
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,271
(siren wailing)

586
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,026
There are no secrets from me.

587
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,948

PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay.
"There are no secrets from me."

600
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,903
- There are no secrets from me.
- There are no secrets from me.

601
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,777
Hey.

602
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,030
What number am I thinking of?

603
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,702
867?

604
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,871
Fucking amazing.

605
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,000
This guy's fucking amazing.

606
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,207
So, what am I thinking of?

607
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,251
I'm thinking the same thing.

608
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,915
Cool. (chuckles)

609
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,013
- Now, why don't I put this down.
- Okay.

610
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,589
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

611
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,104
- Thank-thank you.
- Yeah.

612
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,217
- Mr. Mesmer.
- Ah, just-just Mesmer.

613
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,564
No "mister" necessary.

614
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,018
- You know, I'm a big fan, man.
- Thanks.

615
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,620
- Weren't you in Teenage Kix with A-Train?
- Yep.

616
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,864
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's
really blown up, hasn't he?

617
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,436
- Yeah.
- He's doing his thing.

618
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,126
Yeah, he's great.
I'm-I'm really happy for him.

619
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,573
You a fan of the show?

621
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,821
Oh, nah, man.
I've never seen it.

622
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,284
- Okay.
- You know what I'm a fan of?

623
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,365
Your insider trading.

624
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,080
(exhales)

625
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,223
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

626
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,957
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

627
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,211
I mean, Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

628
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,763
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

629
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,297
Who the fuck are you?

630
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,553
Why don't you take a peep
and see?

631
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,647
How do you know about Cleo?

632
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,277
There are no secrets from me.

633
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,147
Well, I work for Child Services.

634
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,744
My colleague Tina,
she owes me a favor.

635
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:40,531
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

636
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,196
Cut the shit.

637
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,164
I lost custody three years ago.

638
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,474
Nobody believes
in second chances

639
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,458
for fuckups like me.

640
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,880
(panting)

641
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,626
(exhales)

642
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,684
She's waiting on you.

643
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:03,307
Tina. Hey.

644
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,243
- TINA: Hi.
- MOTHER'S MILK: It's good to see you.

645
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,187
TINA:
Good to see you, too.

646
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,518
Five minutes.
Next time you owe me.

647
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,273
MOTHER'S MILK:
I do.

648
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,275
Hey, Cleo.

649
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,688
(sniffles)

650
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,696
You remember your old man?

651
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,238
Hi, Charles.

652
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,419
I'm-I'm sorry that, uh...

653
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,644
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

654
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,638
Would that be okay?

655
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,642
I guess.

656
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,064
TINA:
Okay, Cleo.

657
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,653
We got to get back.

658
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,358
- Bye.
- Hey, uh...

659
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,581
I-I just...

660
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,737
I just want to know
you don't hate me.

661
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,705
I don't really know you.

662
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,304
Hey, wait, um...

663
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,722
So you can know me
a little better.

664
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,892
I don't have a DVD player.

665
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,943
Bye.

666
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,858
Thanks again.
I'll call you next week.

667
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,898
Okay. You all right?

668
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,235
(sniffling)

669
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,240
I can see her every month?

670
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,622
One hour, supervised.

671
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,239
You clean?

672
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,246
- I-I can be.
- Good.

673
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,208
Who do you want me to read?

674
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,381
What are we doing here?

675
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,637
My wife, Becca,
used to hum the Spice Girls.

676
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,309
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

677
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,059
All day long,

678
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,600
walking around the house,
humming.

679
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,645
She was happy.

680
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,108
Now, fuck know why
she was happy with me, but...

681
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,071
she was happy.

682
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,128
Homelander raped her.

683
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,138
Jesus.

684
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,565
I-I'm sorry.

685
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:10,159
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

686
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,424
I know this
'cause she got tagged

687
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,416
in that security camera
right there.

688
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,263
She sat here for three hours.

689
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,681
Didn't move a muscle.

690
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:37,268
Then she just got up
and walked away.

691
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,697
That was eight years ago.

692
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,239
And nobody's seen her since.

693
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,246
Either Homelander killed her

694
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,289
or she killed herself.
Same difference.

695
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,592
You see,

696
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,604
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

697
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,642
You and me,
we're in this together.

698
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,941
For Robin...

699
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,982
and Becca.

700
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:31,334
That is why
you can't allow yourself

701
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,867
to be distracted
by another bird.

702
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,170
Especially not a Supe.

703
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,426
Just remember...

704
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,434
...who your friends

705
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,435
and who your enemies are.

706
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,482
(sniffles)

707
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,422
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

708
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,854
Look, I heard what happened.

709
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,644
I am so, so sorry.

710
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,185
What kind of place
did you grow up in?

711
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,059
Well, I moved around a lot,

712
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,316
so, uh, it was
a bunch of condos.

713
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,818
So, what if I took you
to a house

714
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,701
you'd never seen before,
full of photos

715
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,990
of parents you never met,

716
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,413
toys you never played with,

717
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,463
Hardy Boy books
that you never read?

718
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,587
And then I asked you

719
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,756
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

720
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,801
How would that make you feel?

721
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,353
I wouldn't like that.

722
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,398
I'm really sorry
about the blanket.

723
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,267
It never should have been there,

724
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,524
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

725
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,987
But right now...

726
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,740
we need to finish that tour

727
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,374
and to show how down-to-earth

728
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,961
and ready to serve you are.

729
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,167
And I need you
to tell the mother story.

730
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,089
Please.

731
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,843
Please do it for me.

732
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,135
(exhales)

733
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,219
It was actually my mom
who dragged me along

734
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,975
to my first
Little League practice,

735
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,887
and, uh, pretty soon after that,

736
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,146
I-I just loved the game

737
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,767
more than anything else
in the world.

738
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,774
So every year

739
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,356
she would bake me
a birthday cake

740
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,451
in the shape
of a baseball diamond.

741
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:17,827
And... oh, I got to tell you,
it was perfect.

742
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,486
Perfect.

743
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:23,115
Everything, down to
the last minute details.

744
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,133
Just like her.

745
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,087
MAN:
Cut. Perfect. So great.

746
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,340
- So we're done?
- Uh, yes.

747
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,093
Great.

748
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,154
MESMER:
So...

749
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,031
she can't talk or won't talk?

750
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,359
That's what
you're gonna tell us.

751
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,164
Anything in particular
you want to know?

752
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,259
- Everything there is to know.
- Well, that narrows it down.

753
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,243
Mon coeur.

754
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,245
Will you come?

755
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,287
Have a seat.

756
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,843
It's okay. Have a seat.

757
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,721
Gentle.

758
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,511
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

759
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,436
(takes deep breath)

760
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,185
(Mesmer sighs)

761
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,820
(gasps softly)

762
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,951
(grunts)

763
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,326
- (screams) Jesus fucking...
- MOTHER'S MILK: Goddamn it.

764
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,293
- Relax!
- No.

765
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,544
Everyone relax!

766
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,937
- Just-just go walk it off.
- Walk it off?

767
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,631
She broke my fucking wrist!

768
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,721
She didn't intend any harm.

769
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,047
Oh, could have fooled me.

770
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,137
Get out!
I'm going to the hospital.

771
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,405
Not till we get
what we came for, Mesmer.

772
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,259
- Fuck you! The session's over!
- Sit down!

773
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,426
(panting, sobbing)

774
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,675
Okay, listen.

775
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,646
- I was a field medic.
- (groans)

776
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,186
Don't look at her.
Look at me.

777
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,570
I can patch you up better

778
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,477
than any of those
oxy junkies in the E.R.,

779
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,605
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

780
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,493
(crying)

781
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,370
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

782
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,788
No, I don't have
a goddamn splint!

783
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,957
(ringtone playing
"Ride of the Valkyries")

784
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,956
- (panting)
- It's Butcher.

785
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,418
(whispers):
Be quiet.

786
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,384
- Butcher.
- Where are you?

787
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,879
Shake Shack.

788
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,381
Really?

789
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,012
Fucking magic, that place.

790
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,800
- What'd you get?
- ShackBurger,

791
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,853
uh, cheese fries,

792
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,717
- cookie dough concrete.
- Sounds good.

793
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,055
Does it taste like lies?

794
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,520
I got your phone linked

795
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,439
to my
Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

796
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,228
Now, where the fuck are you?

797
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,692
♪ ♪

798
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,196
Yes, this...
this is a superhero.

799
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,623
- This is good.
- Okay.

800
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,252
- We just keep...?
- Yeah, yeah.

801
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,249
Well, people are
always asking me, you know,

802
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,251
what it's like to live
with my coworkers, and...

the truth is,
we're all great friends,

804
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,342
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,973
uh...

806
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,850
Oh, hey, Elena.

807
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,636
- Hey.
- This is my friend.

808
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,350
I left a pile of messages for...

809
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,350
Yeah, that's what we are.
We're friends.

810
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,142
Can you ask them
to turn that off, please?

811
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,095
I'm gonna need
five minutes, okay?

812
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,686
(indistinct conversation)

813
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,691
Yeah, we're, uh,
doing a reality show.

814
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,323
- That's invasive.
- What are you even doing here?

815
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,241
MAEVE: I would never
turn up to your work.

816
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,451
- I was worried about you.
- I had a bad night.

817
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,451
This Teflon shit, it might work
for everybody else,

818
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,714
- but not with me.
- Will you keep your voice down?

819
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,287
Just tell me what's going on.

820
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,092
Did you ever think that, um...

821
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,876
...maybe I was just looking
for a hookup?

822
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,433
I know you think you know me...

823
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,217
- I used to.
- Yeah, used to. I've changed.

824
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,512
Yeah.

825
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,885
I still know you.

826
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,851
- Oh, come on.
- Afraid to be seen with me.

827
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,982
Afraid to ask for help.

828
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,480
Just... afraid.

829
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,991
Are you filming, Courtenay?

830
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,706
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

831
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,287
We cut... we cut a while ago.

832
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,962
We're setting up a shot
for later.

833
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,130
- MAEVE: Fucking bitch.
- B-roll on the building.

834
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,919
All right, you can cut it, guys.

835
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,882
FRENCHIE:
It's okay.

836
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,013
Everything is okay.

837
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,339
(knocking)

838
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,928
(sighs)
Gentlemen.

839
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,771
Wow. Mesmer.

840
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,520
Hello.

841
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,271
Big fan.

842
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,563
Be with you in a minute.

843
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,316
(quietly):
Well, now we got to kill him.

844
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,860
No, we don't have to kill him.

845
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,863
Look, we made a deal
with the guy.

846
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,735
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

847
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,373
He's just a dad with his kid.

848
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,369
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

849
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,371
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

850
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,083
- You know better than that.
- Sometimes you get further

851
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,915
with people
by treating them like people.

852
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,257
BUTCHER:
Nice decor.

853
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,839
'80s serial killer.
Love it.

854
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,885
All right, then,
let's get cracking.

855
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,121
There's a camp in a...
in a jungle.

856
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,657
(indistinct voices in distance)

857
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,252
She's a soldier.

858
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,535
There's a-a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

859
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,546
Two-headed snake?

860
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,298
Like...?

861
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,009
Yeah.

862
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,049
- With red rays behind it?
- What does that mean?

863
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,143
It's the flag of the
Shining Light Liberation Army.

864
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,509
Frenchie...

865
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,015
you're dating a terrorist.

866
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,693
Is this true?

867
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,322
(indistinct chatter,
birds chirping)

868
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,628

00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,659
(laughing)

871
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,502
Ah.

(man chuckles)

873
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,060
FRENCHIE: There must be
more to all of this.

874
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,848
She can't be a terrorist.

875
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,578
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

876
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,522
Okay, so they smuggle in

877
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,522
a top-shelf extremist recruit

878
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,534
and pump her up with Compound V.

879
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,794
And then,
when she's good and ready,

880
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,003
they cut her loose
to wreak havoc.

881
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,277
- She wouldn't.
- HUGHIE: Wait.

882
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

883
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,164
'Cause the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

884
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,540
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

885
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,707
Is with Sergeant
Fucking Homelander.

886
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,416
Got to let the cunts
in the army now.

887
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,127
Those fuckers are creating
super villains.

888
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,798
And maybe there's more of 'em,
God knows how many.

889
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,378
Holy shit.

890
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,013
Okay, this is a clusterfuck,
even for us.

891
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,800
No, listen to me, okay? Maybe
that's what they want her to be.

892
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,965
But that's not who she is.

893
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,894
- That's not what she wants.
- And you know this

894
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,522
'cause she bends
your fucking ear off?

895
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,599
She saved my life!
She's not bad.

896
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,524
She just want to go home.

897
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,323
She's a fucking Supe,
just like the rest.

898
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,487
How many times do I have
to fucking say it, eh?

899
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,744
Mon coeur,
I know you understand me.

900
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,623
Please. Please.

901
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,330
Tell them who you are.

902
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,750
Tell them what I see.

903
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,684
No.

904
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,348
(sniffling, panting quietly)

905
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,730
(breath trembling)

906
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,076
The drawings are, uh,
palm trees in front of the moon.

907
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,333
It's where she grew up.

(man shouts indistinctly)

910
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,424
They killed her parents.

911
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,674
They kidnapped her
and her brother.

912
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,836
Forced them to be soldiers.

913

915
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,226
No, Kimiko...

916
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,647
You eat it.

917
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,106
She just wants to go back and
get her brother out of there.

918
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,527
Her name's Kimiko.

919
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,161
Kimiko.

920
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,171
Bonjour, Kimiko.

(Butcher sighs)

922
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:21,258
All right, take her back
to the safe house.

MOTHER'S MILK: Where you headed?

924
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,562
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

925
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,729
We've got more than enough
to get the Feds on board now.

926
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:36,607
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

927
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,111
and I'll cut your hands off and
shove 'em so far up your ass,

928
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:43,615
your fingers'll give us a little
wave out your throat, yeah?

929
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,002
Fuck off, wanker.

(TV news music plays)

932
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,671
NEWSMAN:
Some controversial news today

933
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,231
as the Deep went public
with his apology.

934
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,965
DEEP:
I realize that my behavior

935
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,717
caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

936
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,389
and I sincerely apologize.

937
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,180
WOMAN:
Fuck you, fish dick!

938
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,484
(tires squeal)

939
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,687
Keep speaking your truth!

940
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,058
DEEP:
I'm in full support of women

941
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,515
and their ongoing bravery...

942
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,776
BUTCHER:
Never got the point of these.

943
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,779
To me, they always looked
like Granddad's bollocks

944
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,031
flopping in the wind.

945
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:28,195
Do you have
the Compound V or not?

946
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,664
I've got the Compound V...

947
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,125
proof that Vought's injected
babies right across the country,

948
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:37,627
and... something
even more fucking diabolical.

949
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,170
Worse than dosing babies?

950
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,134
Let's just say,
with these cunts,

951
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,134
there ain't no rock bottom.

952
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,716
Let's get it to the lab...

953
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,104
Not so fast.

954
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,679
(clicks tongue)

955
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,015
First things first, eh?

956
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,187
A list of your demands.

957
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,571
How in character.

958
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,068
Exorbitant salary.
Same for your team.

959
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,740
Office space,

960
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,239
in the Flatiron Building,
no less.

961
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Security clearance.
Indemnity clause.

962
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,034
Legal protection.

963
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,446
A formal guarantee that
Homelander will be prosecuted

964
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,615
under the full extent
of the law.

965
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,580
Any of that a problem?

966
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,835
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

967
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,547
And, uh, while they hash it out,

968
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,168
you and I go forward
on good faith.

969
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,336
(Butcher chuckles)

970
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,345
I'm fresh out of good faith.

971
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,847
Now, you and I both know

972
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,098
that you can rubber-stamp
all of that.

973
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,850
So what's it gonna be...

974
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,312
Deputy Director?

975
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,772
I can give you...

976
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,573
everything you want
on this list...

977
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,357
Except?

978
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:44,401
Except Homelander.

979
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:50,992
You know what he's done.

980
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,206
(sighs)

981
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,415
I sympathize.

982
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,796
I really do.

983
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,723
- But it's suicide.
- Yeah, well,

984
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,601
- that's a small fucking price to pay, isn't it?
- Not for you.

985
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,389
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

986
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:16,394
You're fucking scared.

987
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,346
I'm fucking terrified.

988
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,396
And you should be, too.

989
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:27,946
Butcher!

990
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,157
Butcher!

991
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,785
(sighs)

992
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,810
NARRATOR:
This small-town girl-next-door

993
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,597
wanted to change the world.

994
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,351
STARLIGHT:
Since when did hopeful

995
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,312
and naive become
the same thing?

996
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,734
NARRATOR:
But the world had other plans.

997
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,443
DEEP:
Starlight,

998
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,443
I hope you can forgive me.

999
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,244
NARRATOR:
Battered and beaten,

1000
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,277
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

1001
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:14,372
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

1002
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,540
Witness her power.

1003
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,499
Hear her truth.

1004
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,709
And I'm done taking
any more shit.

1005
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,880
NARRATOR:
Watch her stand up

1006
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,299
and fight back for all of us.

1007
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,838
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

1008
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:32,183
- ♪ You're gonna hear me roar. ♪
- The house always wins.

1009
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,983
I'm sorry.

1010
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,257
MAN (on TV):
While little is known about...

1011
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,241
(continues indistinctly)

1012
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,583
...the blacktip reef sharks
can be found mating

1013
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,039
in the summer months

1014
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,369
off the coast
of Northern Australia.

1015
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:03,835
I know you want
to go back to your brother.

1016
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,588
But the people
who did this to you...

1017
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:14,103
you know, they might be doing it
to others.

1018
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,217
We can use your help
stopping them.

1019
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,274
(TV playing in background)

1020
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,231
(sighs)

1021
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,357
It's your choice.

1022
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:30,989
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

1023
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,118
MAN (on TV):
And is following her closely

1024
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,447
in hopes of securing a mate.

1025
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,662
When the female returns
his feelings,

1026
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,623
she will swim slowly

1027
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,713
in a sinusoidal pattern...

1028
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,005
MOTHER'S MILK:
No.

1029
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,007
Baby, why you want
to do me like that?

1030
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,903
'Cause if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

1031
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,530
- then I'm gonna be one behind...
- (door opens)

1032
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,240
and we're not gonna be able
to binge-watch together.

1033
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,658
- (door closes)
- Just-just hold off

1034
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,312
until I get home.

1035
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,270
Uhp, there's a fight
in the yard, baby.

1036
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,941
I got to go. All right.

1037
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,900
How'd it go with Raynor?

1038
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,980
BUTCHER:
No dice.

1039
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,396
What?

1040
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,914
BUTCHER:
Said she got cold feet.

1041
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,026
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

1042
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,453
Yeah, I laid it all out,
even the sample of V.

1043
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,454
Said she couldn't
fucking authorize

1044
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,206
that kind of action
against Vought.

1045
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,537
Too much of a risk.

1046
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,213
Hmm. Did she?

1047
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,092
Fucking spineless cunt.

1048
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,089
So we are royally fucked.

1049
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,050
No, we ain't.

1050
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,182
Fuck 'em.

1051
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,180
We don't need 'em.

1052
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:43,602
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

1053
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:47,063
We'll take down Vought
ourselves. Yeah?

1054
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,984
Yeah.

1055
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,072
Where's Hughie?

1056
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,070
- (panting)
- (line ringing)

1057
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,992
TINA:
This is Tina Mitchell,

1058
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,991
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

1059
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,043
- Leave a message.
- (beep)

1060
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,117
Tina, um, it's Mesmer.

1061
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,962
You met me earlier.

1062
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,747
(panting)

1063
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,671
Um...

1064
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,509
Cleo, uh, didn't really
want to see me today.

1065
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,667
She was just being polite.

1066
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,434
I'm pretty good at reading stuff
like that, so...

1067
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,063
Um, you-you don't have
to-to call me,

1068
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,769
um, or any of that anymore.

1069
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,021
Just, um... it's-it's okay.

1070
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,323
Just... just... please...

1071
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,778
uh, look after her.

1072
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,820
Thank you.

1073
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,988
(panting)

1074
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,036
(panting)

1075
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:50,035
I'm sorry.
The, uh, elevator was out.

1076
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,304
Um, you...
you probably don't remember,

1077
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,838
but, um, we've met before.

1078
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,888
Oh, I...
I would never try and read you.

1079
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,347
Let's be clear.

1080
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,557
I don't know you,

1081
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,598
and I don't want to.

1082
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,228
A-Train said
that you have some information.

1083
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,900
Yeah, we, um... we go back
to the Teenage Kix days.

1084
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,109
- We-we still keep in touch.
- Oh, golly gee shucks.

1085
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,110
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

1086
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,993
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

1087
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:23,162
MESMER:
Yeah.

1088
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,120
He said you were looking
for a, um, French guy...

1089
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:31,173
and a black guy...

1090
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,088
a skinny white guy,

1091
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,127
British guy.

1092
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,132
Where are these from?

1093
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:42,014
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

1094
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,393
I know there's no reward,
but I was hoping

1095
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,140
you could put in a word for me
at Vought?

1096
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,273
I'll take any posting.

1097
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,310
Uh, low five-figures
would be fine.

1098
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,190
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

1099
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,956
(whooshing)

1100
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,539
Oh, that's my phone.

1101
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,205
- (crowd chatter)
- (music playing)

1102
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,224
STARLIGHT:
I mean, I don't remember,

1103
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,086
but my mom said
that when I was born,

1104
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,844
I almost blinded the doctor.

1105
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,596
So, I had powers from the start.

1106
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,059
Why?

1107
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:31,189
No, no, I'm just, uh, curious.

1108
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,227
Mm.

1109
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,230
Do you mind if we just...

1110
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,322
not talk
about hero stuff tonight?

1111
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,318
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

1112
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,990
Yeah. It's an understatement.

1113
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,659
You know,

1114
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,329
there's this beach
in the Bahamas

1115
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,908
where the sand is pink,

1116
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,464
like, cotton-candy pink.

1117
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,578
What's it called?

1118
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,674
Pink Sands.

1119
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:55,749
(both laugh)

1120
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,003
It's not
the most creative name,

1121
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,795
but... let's just go.

1122
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,800
Yeah. No, I can, uh...

1123
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,682
learn how to play
the steel drum.

1124
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,599
You can get cornrows.

1125
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,847
How about tonight?

1126
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,178
Book that ticket.

1127
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,151
Are...
are we talking about this?

1128
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,318
I don't know. I...

1129
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,357
I just know that,

1130
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,361
for me, New York has been such

1131
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,494
an endless shit show.

1132
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,742
Except for you.

1133
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,213
Somehow, in the middle
of it all...

1134
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
...you found me.

1135
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,203
BUTCHER:
Hughie.

1136
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,696
I thought that was you.

1137
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,705
Ha. Oh.

1138
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,117
Oh, I apologize.

1139
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:17,575
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1140
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,995
No. (chuckles)

1141
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,673
Hi, I'm Annie.

1142
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,341
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

1143
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,919
Ah, boy, you really...

1144
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,014
You have a lot of friends
showing up here.

1145
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,800
Yeah.

1146
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,223
Seems like it.

1147
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,721
You're that new girl
in The Seven, ain't you?

1148
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,265
Guilty.

1149
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,348
Wow. It is a pleasure
to meet you.

1150
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,403
And I must say
how marvelous it is

1151
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,937
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

1152
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,651
- You know what I mean?
- Mm.

1153
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,951
You know,
i-if I'm perfectly honest,

1154
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,856
Translucent's always been
my favorite.

1155
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,656
What's he up to?

1156
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,989
I think he's on a mission.

1157
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,445
BUTCHER: Huh. Yeah, I think
I read that, actually.

1158
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,366
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

1159
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,214
I do hope he's all right.

1160
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:02,882
You know what?

1161
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,880
I'm gonna go...
get us a pitcher.

1162
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,262
- Ah.
- Billy, you like...

1163
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,679
Let me guess.
Guinness?

1164
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,797
- I like what you like.
- (both laugh)

1165
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,135
All right. Be right back.

1166
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,432
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

1167
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,896
She's quite tasty
up close and personal.

1168
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,017
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

1169
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,024
I thought
we had an understanding.

1170
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,396
We do. We do.

1171
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,242
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

1172
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,529
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

1173
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,583
you've got your tongue halfway
down the opposition's throat.

1174
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,867
She is not the opposition.

1175
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:40,366
She's a good person, okay?

1176
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,706
I mean, she could help us.

1177
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,630
- Help us?
- Yeah.

1178
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,468
And what do you think
she's gonna do

1179
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,467
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

1180
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,137
When she finds out?

1181
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,227
Give her my best.
