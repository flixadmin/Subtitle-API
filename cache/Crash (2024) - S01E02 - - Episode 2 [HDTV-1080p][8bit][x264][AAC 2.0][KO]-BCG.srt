1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,453
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,965
Mommy!

5
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,363
- Make way.
- What's going on?

6
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,532
She is unresponsive.

7
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,244
- Come on.
- Make way for the paramedics.

8
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,708
Come on.

9
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,400
Who are you?

10
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,662
KM NON-LIFE INSURANCE
INVESTIGATOR CHA YEONHO

11
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,626
So you're the jerk
who reported me to the police.

12
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,628
It's my job.

13
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,552
You live diligently.

14
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,972
If you die like this,
will you receive workers' compensation?

15
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,474
Probably not.

16
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,476
Jung Hokyu.

17
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,522
Receiving funds for criminal settlements
will also be difficult.

18
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,527
- What?
- My company

19
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,156
considers the case
of the late Kim Bongsoon's death

20
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,116
not as a chance event,

21
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,827
but an intentional accident.

22
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,873
Thus, we plan to delay disbursing
the funds for criminal settlements.

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,751
Moreover,

24
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,630
we'll contact other insurance companies

25
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,049
regarding the three previous cases

26
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,092
and reinvestigate your intentionality--

27
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,887
Do you want to die?

28
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,058
Why won't you give me the fund
when someone died?

29
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,685
You didn't complain
when I was paying for insurance.

30
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,146
Does it feel like a waste
to return it to me?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,983
In the case of an intentional accident,
you can't claim insurance compensation.

32
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,070
You little bastard.

33
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,574
Are you okay?

34
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
Are you okay?

35
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,285
Are you okay?

36
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,247
My goodness.

37
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,207
Can you get up?

38
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,919
- Stay there. Don't come closer.
- Jung Hokyu.

39
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,393
Stay still!

40
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,316
- My glasses.
- Glasses?

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,318
I didn't see them.

42
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,112
Let go of me!

43
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,822
I didn't do anything wrong.

44
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,991
That jerk suddenly ran in front of my car.

45
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,840
CRASH

46
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,717
Jung Hokyu.

47
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,306
Do you admit that
you attempted to run over Jo Seoktae?

48
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,768
Why would I want to kill him?

49
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,730
- Jung Hokyu.
- I was there to make a complaint.

50
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,609
- The used car he sold was too shoddy.
- Your story doesn't add up.

51
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,196
If you were there to make a complaint,
why'd you sell the car in a hurry?

52
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,077
You killed those old women
on purpose, right?

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,124
You killed them to claim
insurance compensation, didn't you?

54
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,585
They were purely accidents.

55
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,047
Even the judges agreed with me
all three times.

56
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,344
Let's see if it works for the fourth time.

57
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,845
By the way…

58
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,809
you aren't supposed to install
cameras in the car, no?

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,231
Both wiretaps and spy cameras are illegal,
even for the police.

60
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,789
EPISODE TWO

61
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,069
I think Jung Hokyu caught on
to the surveillance camera in the car.

62
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,030
My heart is beating so fast.

63
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,615
You know that I almost died, right?

64
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,409
How did you know Jung Hokyu was there?

65
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,869
I received a call from Cha Yeonho.

66
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,873
Baby, you're exhausting me.

67
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,545
If you cry, it will complicate
my overall situation.

68
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,463
My code name is Number One.

69
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,590
You've heard of going undercover, right?

70
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,593
That's right.
You've watched those movies, right?

71
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,431
The police can't run an operation
without me.

72
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,558
Jung Hokyu is here.

73
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,644
At Jo Seoktae's dealership.

74
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,940
I think he's after Jo Seoktae.

75
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,194
Where did he go?

76
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,658
Are you feeling okay?

77
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
Did Jung Hokyu confess?

78
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,915
"I didn't attempt to kill Jo Seoktae.

79
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,960
I visited him to make a complaint
about the used car I bought.

80
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,921
Suddenly, you showed up
and caused an accident."

81
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,592
That's bullshit.
I saw it with my own eyes.

82
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,803
If it weren't for him,
I would've kicked the bucket!

83
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,016
How did you know that he'd go there?

84
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,809
There was something I missed that day.

85
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,480
- That day?
- We met there the other day.

86
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,773
Right.

87
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,068
After every accident,

88
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,237
Jung Hokyu bought a used car
from Jo Seoktae.

89
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,532
I needed to check
the relationship between the two of them.

90
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,118
Between me and that lunatic?

91
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,786
Who do you take me for?

92
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,288
He's clean.

93
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,125
I checked his financial records
and there were no suspicious transactions.

94
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,169
He's just a swindler.

95
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,839
What do we do
about Jung Hokyu?

96
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,510
We arrested him, but without a warrant,
we'll have to let him go in 48 hours.

97
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,138
Right.

98
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,189
KM NON-LIFE INSURANCE

99
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,990
KM NON-LIFE INSURANCE

100
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,410
SECOND VICTIM, THIRD VICTIM,
KM NON-LIFE INSURANCE, JUNG HOKYU

101
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,728
What's this? You don't even smoke,
but you're holding a cigarette.

102
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,566
Holding it offers consolation at times.

103
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,736
I acted rashly due to
my determination to catch Jung Hokyu.

104
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,907
It doesn't change the fact
that he killed those grandmas on purpose.

105
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,998
By the way, we didn't find
any evidence at Jung Hokyu's house.

106
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,500
It's hard to prove
his intention to kill Jo Seoktae.

107
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,252
How will we get a warrant?

108
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,047
Let's apply for a warrant
for an assault on Cha Yeonho.

109
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
For assault, you get two years.

110
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,927
If the sentence is two years or less,
an emergency arrest doesn't apply.

111
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,681
If Jung Hokyu walks free
without a warrant,

112
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,808
we'll be criticized for going overboard.

113
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,811
Let's do everything we can.

114
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,857
Hmm, did you contact the man who bought
the used car from Jung Hokyu?

115
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,860
Yes, I'll meet him in front of his place.

116
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,445
But there won't be any evidence.

117
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,989
If Jung Hokyu knew
about the surveillance camera,

118
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,699
he would've gotten rid of it.

119
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,492
Check just in case.

120
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay.

121
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,130
- What happened to your face?
- I fell down.

122
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,632
Be careful.

123
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,259
Even insurance investigators
can get into accidents.

124
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,143
Did you wrap up Jung Hokyu's case well?

125
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,858
You don't live alone in this society.
We should help each other.

126
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,070
If you're having a hard time, talk to me.

127
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,491
If I cover it up quietly,
will I also get some benefits?

128
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,537
The slice of pie in Jung Hokyu's case
seems too small to split.

129
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,458
Cover it up quietly?

130
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,460
We say there are no problems
since it's true.

131
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,212
People will get the wrong idea.

132
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,923
Okay?

133
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,133
Go to the hospital.

134
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,521
Let's check out the car.

135
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,318
Was this car used for a crime?

136
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
Well, no.

137
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,322
The previous owner is a suspect,
but the car is clean.

138
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,032
No wonder it was so cheap.

139
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,911
What are you looking for?

140
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,997
We can't disclose information
regarding the investigation.

141
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,208
- Okay.
- We're done.

142
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,210
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Okay.

143
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,754
About the man who sold me the car.

144
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,631
I remembered this
when you called him a suspect.

145
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,093
That day, he borrowed my phone
at the parking lot of the market

146
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,262
saying his was out of battery.

147
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,430
Isn't it strange?

148
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,267
He was just on the phone with me,
but he claimed that his battery was dead.

149
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,145
Sir, may I check your cell phone?

150
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,773
I checked it just in case,
but he had deleted the number.

151
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,359
I see.

152
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,158
Why do you think
Jung Hokyu left the camera and GPS?

153
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,535
They were evidence
of an illegal investigation.

154
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,164
Who knows? Perhaps he did it to lose us.
In any case, it's a relief.

155
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,125
At times, he's thorough.
While at others, he's clumsy.

156
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,336
He usually seems meticulous, but--

157
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,839
Who could it be?

158
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,091
Who'd he call using someone else's phone?

159
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,802
We'll have to check.

160
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,346
Perhaps, he didn't want to leave
a call history.

161
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,766
WOO DONGGI

162
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,601
- It's Detective Woo.
- Answer it.

163
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,313
- What is it?
- <i>Lieutenant Min, it's about the chief.</i>

164
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,274
- He found out?
- <i>Superintendent Yeom made a report.</i>

165
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,320
- <i>Captain Jung went to Chief's office.</i>
- Seriously? He should've waited for me.

166
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,113
Okay. I'll be there soon.

167
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,118
Things became complicated.
Chief is out to get Captain Jung.

168
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,872
- Why?
- Chief's son got a DUI last month.

169
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,876
Since Captain Jung stuck to the rules,
Chief got into major trouble.

170
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,130
It hindered his promotional transfer
scheduled for next year.

171
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,050
It wasn't Captain's fault.
He should've raised his son right.

172
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,469
- Even so.
- That's Captain's problem.

173
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,348
He should be more flexible.
Why does he have to be so unyielding?

174
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,559
Every time something goes wrong,
he says he'll resign--

175
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,981
No way.

176
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,358
Not a chance.

177
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,652
JUNG CHAEMAN

178
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,613
What's this?

179
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,367
The emergency arrest ends
at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow.

180
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,787
If I fail to arrest the suspect by then,
I'll return my ID.

181
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,164
You installed a camera
in the suspect's car.

182
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,293
On top of that, you made an arrest
without any incriminating evidence.

183
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,128
Imagine the press finding out about it.

184
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,633
The public are very sensitive and
unfavorable toward the police these days.

185
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,593
Captain Jung.

186
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,348
I mean, Chaeman. Your ID won't cut it.

187
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
Gosh, why did you do that?

188
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,397
You're a stickler
for rules and principles.

189
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,528
Or do these rules not apply to you?

190
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,825
I took the unlawful path
and ended up spoiling the work,

191
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,285
so I have no excuses.

192
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,787
Although opportunities have moved past us,

193
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,790
I'll get back up with an undying spirit.

194
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>My gosh.</i>

195
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,057
- Isn't Captain back yet?
- No, not yet.

196
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,439
- Did you find anything?
- What happened?

197
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,025
I explained the situation
and helped him understand.

198
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,153
We just need to find evidence.

199
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,696
Hold on a second.

200
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,239
- Wait a minute.
- What are you doing?

201
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,285
- What are you doing?
- I knew it. Where's your ID?

202
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,954
Why do you need my ID?

203
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,957
Here.

204
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,543
You want to borrow it?

205
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
See? I knew he couldn't do it.

206
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,891
CHIEF GU KYUNGMO

207
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,100
What was it?

208
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,895
Did he say something like "fart"?

209
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,483
And then it sounded like a movie title.

210
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,235
Right, <i>The Wailing</i>. Fart wailing.

211
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,989
This idiom sounds so disgusting.

212
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,617
FART WAILING

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,286
What? I guess I heard it wrong.

214
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,706
For goodness' sake.

215
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,507
It's the 21st century.
Why use so many darn Chinese idioms?

216
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,884
IF YOU SET OUT TO DIE, YOU'LL LIVE
IF YOU SET OUT TO LIVE, YOU'LL DIE

217
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,721
In the last two days,
he definitely moved less.

218
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,517
Around this time, he probably noticed
that we were tailing him.

219
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
Which places did he visit?

220
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,188
A nearby grocery store,
a <i>seolleungtang</i> restaurant,

221
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,898
and three gas stations.

222
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,321
He bought groceries at the store,
ate at the restaurant,

223
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,407
and filled up his tank at the gas station.

224
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,368
9 MINUTES AND 45 SECONDS

225
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,538
But he stayed at the gas station
for quite a while.

226
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,665
A total of 9 minutes and 45 seconds.

227
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
Doesn't it take three minutes
to fill up the tank?

228
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,006
He went into the office, so I thought
he was looking for the restroom.

229
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,551
Come to think of it, it was strange.

230
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,139
He left the house, got gas,
and went back to his house.

231
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,018
What if he went to the gas station
for a different purpose?

232
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,648
Send me the address
of the gas station, okay?

233
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,443
OIL GAS STATION

234
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,781
Oh. I remember this man.

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,616
He visited the day before yesterday.

236
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,703
He came to the office
and suddenly asked to borrow my phone.

237
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,871
Your phone?

238
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,790
Yes. He was all worked up.

239
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,170
He said that he needed to make
an urgent call, but his phone was dead.

240
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,132
Do you still have the call history?

241
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,091
Let me check.

242
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,059
It isn't here. I think he erased it.

243
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,519
Oh, I see.

244
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,981
Now we know that he
borrowed phones to hide the call history.

245
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,317
And the call history of the man
who bought his car?

246
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,152
- It'll be ready soon.
- Okay.

247
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,281
Oh, right. Where is the recording
of his call to the call center?

248
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,241
<i>If the victim dies,</i>

249
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,744
<i>how much do I get
for police investigation and settlement?</i>

250
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>It depends on the plan,</i>

251
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,248
<i>but the usual number is
from 30 to 50 million won.</i>

252
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>Thirty to fifty million won?</i>

253
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,668
<i>Hold on.</i>

254
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,712
<i>What?</i>

255
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,174
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Yes, go ahead.</i>

256
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,053
<i>I don't want the plan that gives me
benefits when the insurance expires.</i>

257
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,516
<i>I want the plan that gives me
benefits when there's an accident.</i>

258
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,646
Someone is coaching him.

259
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,398
Listen carefully.

260
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,443
…<i>won? Hold on.</i>

261
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,612
<i>What?</i>

262
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>Hello?</i>

263
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,451
- He asked someone next to him, right?
- Yes.

264
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,246
I think this person is controlling
Jung Hokyu from behind.

265
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,166
So there's an accomplice
who's meticulous and careful.

266
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,669
Hold on.

267
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,005
Yes, Mr. Cha.

268
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,970
- <i>I have something to discuss with you.</i>
- Go ahead.

269
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>The director at my company was overlooking
Jung Hokyu's insurance fraud.</i>

270
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,559
<i>It seems like she intentionally omitted</i>

271
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,478
<i>the records of Jung Hokyu's past accidents
in the network.</i>

272
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,438
I see. Jung Hokyu has an accomplice.

273
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,692
We're tracking the phone number now.
Perhaps it's your director.

274
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,529
<i>Her name is Park Hyunjung.
I'll text you her number.</i>

275
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>And there's one more thing.</i>

276
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,449
Among Jung Hokyu's victims--

277
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,204
<i>What about his victims?</i>

278
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,709
Never mind. I'll tell you
after investigating some more.

279
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,922
Okay. I'll call you
once we identify the accomplice.

280
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>Okay. Goodbye.</i>

281
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,849
JM WRAPS

282
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,853
Excuse me.

283
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,524
What? What brings you here at this hour?

284
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,903
I have something to ask.

285
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
I told you everything last time.

286
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,825
I was going through old insurance records
and I found something strange.

287
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,204
You were acquainted with Jung Hokyu,

288
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,706
the driver who caused the accident.

289
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,084
In 2021, the two of you met

290
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,670
as the perpetrator and victim
of a car accident.

291
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,340
I don't remember.

292
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,093
So you didn't know who he was.

293
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:25,557
I wondered if the two of you
knew each other before the accident.

294
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,517
Of course not.

295
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,730
I thought I met him for the first time
after my mother's accident.

296
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,487
- Please excuse me for intruding at night.
- Okay.

297
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,413
Mr. Song Jiman.

298
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,629
You killed your mother
for the death benefit, didn't you?

299
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,881
What?

300
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,800
What are you talking about?

301
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,594
- I'm the victim's son.
- Yes.

302
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,973
You were the only one
who lost your immediate family.

303
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,935
And the only one who received
a hefty insurance payout.

304
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,481
My mother was the one
who bought the life insurance.

305
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,360
- If you don't believe me, go ask--
- She never imagined

306
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,364
that her own child would kill her
for the death benefit.

307
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,163
- You must be unhappy I got it, but--
- You know Director Park Hyunjung, no?

308
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,584
She was in charge
of Jung Hokyu's third case.

309
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,462
She overlooked the insurance fraud
despite being aware.

310
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,506
She couldn't have done it
for 50 million won.

311
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,301
I'm sure there was a bigger payout.

312
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
Perhaps,

313
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,432
the family of the deceased

314
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,643
promised her
a large portion of the death benefit.

315
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,147
That's enough.

316
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,443
- Before I call the police.
- I'll call them.

317
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,489
I have to check the bank transactions
between you and Director Park anyway.

318
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,495
Would it be okay to consider this

319
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,498
as your admittance to the crime?

320
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,501
<i>I've got the receiver's number.</i>

321
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,296
The phone belongs
to Song Jiman, 32 years old.

322
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,423
Song Jiman? Not Park Hyunjung?

323
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,966
That's right. Song Jiman.

324
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,426
SONG JIMAN
DATE OF BIRTH: OCT 23, 1992

325
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,095
- Song Jiman. The name sounds--
- Song Jiman.

326
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,931
He's the son of Yoon Seungok,
the third victim.

327
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,184
Let me think.

328
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,894
Right. The vehicle wrapping company.

329
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,985
There's something
I don't understand.

330
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,530
You received a death benefit
of over one billion won.

331
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,450
So why did you murder Kim Bongsoon?

332
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,745
Why did you risk getting caught
for 50 million won?

333
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,005
That wasn't my order.

334
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,843
Hokyu

335
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,180
did it all on his own.

336
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,062
- Let's take my car.
- Okay.

337
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,146
All right.

338
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,244
<i>And there's one more thing.</i>
<i>Among Jung Hokyu's victims</i>…

339
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,328
He's not picking up?

340
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,956
No. The call is going through,
but he isn't picking up.

341
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,082
For goodness' sake.

342
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,667
NAMGANG POLICE STATION
LIEUTENANT

343
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:49,177
Do you admit ordering Jung Hokyu to murder
your mother for the death benefit?

344
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,975
I wanted to open a business,
but I didn't have any money.

345
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,478
What can I do?
It was the only way I could get money.

346
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,565
My mother jokingly told me

347
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,860
to open a business with the payout
once she passed away.

348
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,531
Then why did you kill the others?

349
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,992
Had I killed my mother right away,

350
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,786
people would've suspected me.

351
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,414
It was a way to divert attention.

352
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,505
Now that the insurance fraud
has been proven,

353
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,426
you'll need to return
the compensation you received.

354
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,142
I had to kill my own mother

355
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,228
for that money.

356
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,109
And you're telling me

357
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,070
to return it?

358
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,087
Just in case,

359
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,965
I bought fire insurance for my shop too.

360
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,053
The total compensation must be
about 200 million won.

361
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:19,267
An investigator's rude interrogation
angered the victim's bereaved family.

362
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,730
And during a physical scuffle,
the shop caught on fire.

363
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,277
I'll get away with probation, right?

364
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,118
Hold on. Where is the lighter?

365
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,539
Here it is--

366
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,681
Donggi, take the back.
Hyunkyung and I'll take the front.

367
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,807
- Okay.
- Okay.

368
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,692
Fire extinguisher!

369
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,537
Fortunately, your wound isn't severe.
Watch out for an infection.

370
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,211
You're more reckless than you seem.

371
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,714
What would you have done if we were late?

372
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,762
I'm sorry to say this
to an injured person,

373
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,973
but we need a statement,
so let's go back to the station.

374
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,479
This should be enough.

375
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,486
I'll email you my statement.

376
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,239
See you next time.

377
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,164
I doubt we'll meet again.

378
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,544
We'll stay in position.

379
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,887
Thank you.

380
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,189
Don't worry. The doctor told me
that your injury isn't life-threatening.

381
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,233
What a relief.

382
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,820
A man who murdered his own mother
for money shouldn't get an easy way out.

383
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,739
I don't know what that jerk told you,

384
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,450
but I'm innocent.

385
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,081
Why'd you set the shop on fire?

386
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,377
He kept painting me
as a shameless criminal

387
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,547
who murdered his own mother
for insurance compensation.

388
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,174
So I got worked up.

389
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,095
It was a mistake.

390
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,139
I'm serious.

391
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,770
<i>Do you admit</i>
<i>ordering Jung Hokyu to murder your mother</i>

392
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,856
<i>for the death benefit?</i>

393
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,735
<i>I wanted to open a business,</i>
<i>but I didn't have any money.</i>

394
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,113
<i>What can I do?
It was the only way I could get money.</i>

395
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,032
Let's go. I think we're done here.

396
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,662
By the way, your insurance won't cover
the expenses from this accident

397
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,456
because it was intentional.

398
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,960
Get well soon.

399
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,379
You should eat your meals
in prison, not the hospital.

400
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
I--

401
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,050
See you in court.

402
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,641
Jung Hokyu.

403
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,102
Are you still unwilling to confess?

404
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,689
My lawyer told me

405
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,734
that you'll have to let me go
in 48 hours without a warrant.

406
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,280
That's right.

407
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,700
It's too bad because we got a warrant.

408
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,665
Song Jiman.

409
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,172
You ran over old women
without immediate family

410
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,257
to get the funds for the investigation

411
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,968
and ran over your friend's mom
to get the death benefit.

412
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,346
You even bribed
the insurance investigators.

413
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,181
You've committed so many crimes.

414
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,517
Says who?

415
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,769
Was it Jiman?

416
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,985
- You're wrong. It was a mistake.
- Jung Hokyu.

417
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,155
You're a murderer.

418
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,952
You're a serial killer
who grabbed the wheel instead of a knife.

419
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,459
There isn't a single life
you can take at your wish,

420
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,547
even if it belongs to a senior citizen
who's weak and all alone.

421
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,396
Miss, what's wrong with you?

422
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,898
- Please be quiet.
- You be quiet. Goodness.

423
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,068
I'm being quiet, but they're being loud.
Isn't that right?

424
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,695
Get back to work.

425
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,780
I'll get back to work soon. Just you wait.

426
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,075
Oh my. Cha Yeonho. See you again.

427
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,369
- See you again, okay?
- Get going.

428
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,873
Oh my! For goodness' sake.
Do you want to have a go at me?

429
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,374
Hey!

430
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,385
What?

431
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,434
Why didn't you come pick it up?

432
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,604
Must I bring it back to you?
Am I a deliveryman?

433
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,944
Also…

434
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,574
you should all be glad
that an arrest warrant was issued.

435
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,869
Let's be careful, okay?
It won't end with a pay cut next time.

436
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,829
Yes, sir.

437
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,748
- Stay alert.
- Yes, sir.

438
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,126
Captain Jung, why are your eyes swollen?
Did you drink again?

439
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,338
What are you,
Mel Gibson from <i>Lethal Weapon</i>?

440
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,090
What kind of a police officer
drinks every day?

441
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,181
Hmm. Did you fool Chief with this?

442
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,892
It's from two years ago.

443
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,685
- Is it mine?
- Yes.

444
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,812
Oh, it is mine.

445
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,871
THE LATE LEE HYUNSOO

446
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,381
HYUNSOO, HOW IS IT IN HEAVEN?

447
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,924
YOU BROUGHT WARMTH
INTO MY WORLD

448
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,342
I'LL LIVE WITH THAT WARMTH
I LOVE YOU

449
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,753
The weather is nice.

450
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,048
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

451
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,679
Why'd you come here? You must be busy.

452
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,518
Time passes by so quickly.

453
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,437
It's already been ten years…

454
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,107
since my Hyunsoo passed away.

455
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,364
You should stop coming.

456
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,159
You've done enough.

457
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,538
I'm going to quit work.

458
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,626
I want to go into a different profession.

459
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,337
Is there a profession you have in mind?

460
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,259
It's the profession you used to have.

461
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:36,074
ONE YEAR LATER

462
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,330
Excuse me.

463
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,416
I'm sorry, but can you please park my car?

464
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,878
I'm a novice driver,
so parking is hard for me.

465
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,172
Here.

466
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,402
All New Pride, 2012.

467
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,487
Okay.

468
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,616
Actyon Sports, 2011.

469
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,368
Okay. Correct. Next.

470
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,411
Here.

471
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,790
- New Opirus, 2006.
- My goodness.

472
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,669
Then how about this one?

473
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,630
It's Equus. Let's see.

474
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,968
You need to give me
the exact model name and generation.

475
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,929
Let me answer.
New Equus VI, second generation.

476
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,181
It came out in 2009 and has 430 hp.

477
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,268
Correct. How did you memorize
the horsepower too?

478
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,645
I don't need to memorize it. I just know.

479
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,981
Gosh, you're so annoying.

480
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,900
Hey, is Sohee here yet?

481
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,403
- It'll be lunchtime soon.
- She should be here by now.

482
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,497
Darn, I told her not to park like that.

483
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,207
Why? It's cool.

484
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,293
The car will break down. It'll get ill.

485
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,587
- Good morning.
- Welcome.

486
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,464
- Good morning, my foot. It's almost noon.
- Shall I come up?

487
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,801
- Let's go eat. I'm hungry.
- Did you come to work to eat?

488
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,386
- Yes, I did.
- I see.

489
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,721
- Hurry up.
- Let's go eat.

490
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,682
I'll go to the chief's office first.

491
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,642
- Okay.
- What did he say?

492
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,102
He'll go to the chief's office first.

493
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,812
Go ahead without me.

494
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,275
Jinyoung.

495
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,903
Is the work okay?

496
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,613
Yes, the owner takes good care of me.

497
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:43,784
Ah. I'm close to the owner,
so tell me if anything happens.

498
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,203
Okay.

499
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,746
All right.

500
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,457
Ride safely.

501
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,958
Go.

502
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,632
It's him, right? Kim Bongsoon's grandson.

503
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,009
- Did he get into college?
- Goodness.

504
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,930
He couldn't focus on his studies
after what happened.

505
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,765
Let's go.

506
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,270
- We're here.
- Welcome.

507
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,688
- We're here.
- All right.

508
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,566
- Where's Captain Jung?
- He's coming.

509
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,071
- Jinyoung is doing well, right?
- Goodness, he's really diligent.

510
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,990
I don't have to say a word.
He does everything on his own.

511
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,951
Of course. I introduced him.

512
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,495
We'll have four servings
that are close to five.

513
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,664
Okay…
…take a seat.

514
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,415
- Okay.
- All right.

515
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,460
My goodness.

516
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,051
What is he doing here?

517
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,982
Did you remove the fat
because of cholesterol?

518
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,026
No. Because of the texture.

519
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,701
- It's been a while.
- I heard about your salary cut.

520
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,370
Gosh, how did you hear about that?

521
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,958
How about you?
Did you get a promotion at your company?

522
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,421
I quit. I was branded as a whistleblower.

523
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,050
Neither one of us had a gain.

524
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,387
By the way, what brings you here?

525
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,559
- I'm meeting someone here.
- Here? Who?

526
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,396
Oh. Captain, you're here.

527
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,856
- You're here, sir.
- Yes.

528
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,232
Everyone is here.

529
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,362
Gosh, you started eating alone.
You should've waited for us.

530
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,115
It's okay. I'm used to eating alone.

531
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,327
- Come here. Let's eat together.
- What?

532
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,745
- Come here.
- What?

533
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,458
- Come. Let's eat together.
- Come on.

534
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,674
All right. He's the new member
of our team,

535
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,635
Lieutenant Cha Yeonho. Say hello.

536
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,012
- Our team?
- Lieutenant?

537
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,524
Lieutenant Cha Yeonho.

538
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,110
Special recruitment.
Graduated from KAIST with a math degree.

539
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,364
- Gosh, KAIST?
- Insurance fraud investigator,

540
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,241
traffic accident investigator,
and damage estimator.

541
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,535
He's a certified transportation engineer

542
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,497
and a fire and explosion investigator.

543
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,249
Why'd he come here
if he graduated from KAIST?

544
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,504
KAIST isn't that impressive. My alumni

545
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,341
teach at academies
or work in research or games companies.

546
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,009
They all got regular jobs.

547
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,137
Why did you become
an insurance investigator?

548
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,266
The salary was high.
I also got a lot of alone time.

549
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,354
Why did you quit your high-paying job
and become a detective?

550
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,357
I'm not sure.

551
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,527
How did this happen?
You didn't tell me anything in advance.

552
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,321
You said that we needed a new recruit.

553
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,240
Whatever. He's someone we really need.

554
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,535
He's the last piece of the grand puzzle
I have in mind.

555
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,746
The last-- You said I was the last piece!

556
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,832
Did I?

557
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,170
I see. In any case,
he'll be a good partner to you.

558
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,673
It's true that we need a new recruit.

559
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,217
But we need someone who can contribute.
He's a rookie.

560
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,928
He isn't a rookie.
He worked as an insurance investigator.

561
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,639
His investigative skills were proven
at the Jung Hokyu case.

562
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,142
Whatever. He doesn't belong
in an organization.

563
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,977
You saw him eating alone.

564
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,479
I eat alone at times too.

565
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,108
Teach him well.
He'll be helpful once he gets polished.

566
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,192
I'll get going.

567
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,862
How am I supposed to polish him? Captain!

568
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,021
Hello, this is TCI--

569
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,898
What?

570
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,150
Okay. We'll be right there.

571
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,527
- There's been an accident.
- Gosh.

572
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,908
<i>TCI members ran over quickly</i>

573
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,494
<i>to the back of the police station,
less than five minutes away.</i>

574
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,831
<i>The situation is chaotic.</i>

575
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,209
I know you.

576
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,294
I introduced myself recently.

577
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,963
I'm the new member of TCI, Cha Yeonho.

578
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,216
Right.

579
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,260
I remember. You went to POSTECH or KAIST.

580
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,515
Couldn't you be more alert in the morning?
How could you miss the car?

581
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,267
Didn't you see the car coming out?

582
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,811
<i>He claims that Lieutenant Cha
is the perpetrator.</i>

583
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,480
What are you looking at?

584
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,484
- Hey, Superintendent Yeom. There you are.
- Goodness.

585
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,153
- You saw what just happened, right?
- Yes, I did.

586
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:15,241
Whose fault was it?
The bicycle hit me from the back, right?

587
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,076
According to the traffic laws,
parking areas--

588
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:22,081
Come on. This isn't a road,
so forget about traffic laws!

589
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:26,335
This isn't a road, but the same laws apply
to accidents in the parking lot.

590
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:33,133
Uh, we must check and see if there are
any incoming vehicles on the passageway--

591
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,844
Well, that isn't a vehicle, but a bicycle.

592
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,096
Hey, stop filming.

593
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:41,058
Under the traffic laws, bicycles are
considered vehicles.

594
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,435
Forget it. Fine.

595
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,979
So what's the ratio of fault?

596
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,897
Seven to three.

597
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,357
Seven to three.

598
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,776
Okay. Seven to three. I'm three, right?

599
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,863
You-- You're… …seven, sir.

600
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,199
My goodness.

601
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,243
That's how the law is.

602
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,412
What are you saying?

603
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,832
- Hey, Min Sohee.
- Yes?

604
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,835
Yes, sir.

605
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,380
What are your thoughts?

606
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,050
Hurry and tell me.
Do you think the ratio is seven to three?

607
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,305
Well, yes. Yes.

608
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,517
The accident occurred while you were
backing out in a parking area.

609
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,227
In such cases,

610
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,189
the car that was backing out
is a bit more at fault.

611
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,193
And due to the principle of liability
for the stronger party on the road…

612
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,782
…you'll be 0.5 parts more…

613
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,163
I'm getting high blood pressure
so early this morning.

614
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,582
So you're saying I'm 7.5 parts at fault?

615
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,085
No, you would be 8.5 parts.

616
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,588
<i>Lieutenant Cha strikes back.</i>

617
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,175
Why?

618
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,138
You didn't turn on the hazard lights
as you entered the parking area.

619
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,974
In such cases, he gets
an additional 10%, right?

620
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,102
<i>A rookie police officer who's much younger
gives him a lecture.</i>

621
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,563
<i>Chief Gu becomes furious.</i>

622
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,065
So…

623
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,986
…I'm 8.5?
You really think I'm 8.5 parts at fault?

624
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:21,742
If you're dissatisfied with the ratio,
call your insurance company.

625
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,452
Hey, what did you say?

626
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,747
<i>It's an important matter
to Lieutenant Cha.</i>

627
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,418
- Hang up.
- Yes. This is Namgang Police Station.

628
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,713
- There has been a minor collision.
- Hang up.

629
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,343
<i>The fellow police officers are flustered.</i>

630
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,222
Don't be ridiculous.
How is it 8.5 parts my fault?

631
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,017
Am I supposed to have eyes
on the back of my head?

632
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,854
Look at this here.

633
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,149
What did the insurance company say?

634
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,902
It was just as Cha Yeonho said.
It was 8.5 to 1.5.

635
00:44:56,985 --> 00:45:00,531
He persuaded the insurance agent too.
At first, he said it was seven to three.

636
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,783
He changed his mind
after listening to Lieutenant Cha.

637
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,411
Mr. Cha wasn't entirely wrong.

638
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,997
But he didn't have to talk back
to the chief at every turn.

639
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,376
TCI is already in the doghouse
with the chief.

640
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,920
Mr. Cha will contribute to that a lot
from now on.

641
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,756
A doghouse is better than no house,
so keep him in check.

642
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,467
How are we supposed to address him?

643
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,928
By rank, he's on the same level
as Lieutenant Min.

644
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,682
We already have a lieutenant,
so what about "Inspector"?

645
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,351
- Inspector Cha?
- Call him Inspector Cha.

646
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,769
Mmm. Inspector Cha.

647
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,438
- Inspector Cha? Okay.
- Yes.

648
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:39,194
- Come on.
- Damn it. Let go of me.

649
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,824
Sorry, this spot is for
police vehicles. Please park elsewhere.

650
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,617
- Can't I park here briefly?
- I'm sorry.

651
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,705
- I won't stay long.
- I'm sorry. We must keep this spot empty.

652
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,457
Please park somewhere else.

653
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,502
- Why would you leave it empty?
- We put up the canopy for a reason.

654
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,298
It's a parking spot for police vehicles.

655
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,759
There are no other spots.
Let me park here shortly.

656
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,219
Sorry, but it's only for police vehicles.

657
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,846
It's still a parking area, right?

658
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:10,267
But only police vehicles can park here.

659
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,270
- It doesn't say so.
- There isn't a separate sign,

660
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,566
but we set up the canopy
to mark that it's for police vehicles.

661
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,151
But it's a parking area, right?

662
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,277
DANGER

663
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,740
Donggi, you're working hard.

664
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,824
SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT

665
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,494
We investigate during the day
and do sobriety checks at night.

666
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,163
- I'm an IBM.
- What? IBM?

667
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,873
Incredibly bitter man.

668
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,459
Since when did we run Breathalyzer tests?

669
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,294
It's wrong to think of it

670
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,630
as the chief's revenge, right?

671
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,508
Revenge, my foot.
The Traffic Division's work is our work.

672
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,302
It's the maximum enforcement period
for drunk driving,

673
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,638
so let's help out the Traffic Division.

674
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,847
Cheer up.

675
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,642
Though I can't cheer up either.

676
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,853
What are you talking about?

677
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,565
Why would my license be suspended?
My result is 0.03%.

678
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,736
You're subject to regulations
if it's 0.03% or higher.

679
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,365
Thus, 0.03% is included.

680
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,700
I know that, okay? How dare you?

681
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,619
Who are you to schooling me?

682
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,496
It's "school," not "schooling."

683
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,997
Move out of the way.

684
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,999
You don't have to humor him.

685
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,252
Sir, come on out.
You should reflect on yourself

686
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,338
if you're caught drinking and driving,
not yell at a police officer.

687
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,590
It isn't like that. Miss, listen to me.

688
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,802
You drank a lot, huh? Don't "Miss" me.

689
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,973
I mean, he tried to arrest me
even though I was at 0.03%.

690
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,852
- All right, sir. Miss is over here. Miss.
- Honey.

691
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,603
- Come here.
- Talk to him.

692
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,355
- Come with me.
- Talk to him.

693
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,440
All right.

694
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,779
<i>Sun 22.</i>
<i>There's been an accident</i>

695
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,197
<i>near Kanghee Junction.</i>

696
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,032
<i>Requesting nearby patrol car to mobilize.</i>

697
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,452
Sun 23. Roger that. I'm on my way.

698
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,680
- So many cars are here.
- They arrived so fast.

699
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,226
What is it? Is there a problem?

700
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,065
Hurry up.

701
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,737
My goodness.

702
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,117
Sir, open your eyes. Sir.

703
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,204
- Where am I?
- What?

704
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,666
Sir, you've been in an accident.
You crashed your car. Please come out.

705
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,714
My goodness. Please come on out.

706
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,383
Gosh, be careful.

707
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,552
Are you okay? Huh?

708
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,014
A ghost.

709
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,642
- What?
- A ghost.

710
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,686
I saw a ghost dressed in white over there.

711
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,146
I think he drank a lot.

712
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,149
She was right there.
My wheels suddenly turned too.

713
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,485
All right.
Please take a breathalyzer test first.

714
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,988
You can do a blood test if you want.
Follow the instructions.

715
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,490
- This way.
- I'm serious.

716
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,617
- All right.
- A ghost.

717
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,452
She was dressed in white.

718
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,083
- He'll definitely get his license revoked.
- It's fascinating.

719
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,709
A dog can't become a person,

720
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,586
but a person can become a dog.

721
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,635
What is he doing over there?

722
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,583
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

723
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,295
Hold on. Are you certain?

724
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,424
I have someone at the HR Bureau
of the National Police Agency.

725
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,885
According to him, the son of Cha Gyumin,
the Director of Investigations,

726
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,513
passed the police exam this year.

727
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,723
His name is Cha Yeonho.

728
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,603
Director Cha Gyumin?

729
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:29,109
Among the candidates
for the future commissioner general,

730
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,571
he's the strongest.

731
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,327
Is Cha Yeonho really Director Cha's son?

732
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,172
Even a bad relationship is a relationship.

733
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,216
Don't you think it's a good opportunity
to make connections?

734
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,803
Why don't you schedule a meeting?

735
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,306
If you call him over alone,
people will talk.

736
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,515
Call over the entire team.

737
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,309
- Captain Jung too?
- Yes.

738
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,353
I don't want to.
Captain Jung makes me uncomfortable.

739
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,897
Praise them and cherish them.

740
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,567
"I don't hate you guys.
On the contrary, I cherish you all.

741
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,489
As for my son's DUI
and the recent minor collision,

742
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,284
you followed the rules
and took good care of it."

743
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,920
IF YOU SET OUT TO DIE, YOU'LL LIVE
IF YOU SET OUT TO LIVE, YOU'LL DIE

744
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,758
DIRECTOR CHA! CHA YEONHO?

745
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,761
Do you expect me to say that…

746
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,682
…with my own mouth?

747
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,810
Look far into the future.

748
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,229
Cha Yeonho is still a rookie.

749
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,815
That's why he adheres
to rules and principles.

750
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,694
If he disapproves of you, he might
bad-mouth you to Director Cha.

751
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,826
Gosh.

752
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,454
Get rid of the chief's parking spot?

753
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,539
Yes.

754
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,959
Because of the chief
and other executives' parking spots…

755
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,168
FOR THE HAPPINESS
OF OUR CITIZENS

756
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,213
…there aren't enough parking spots
for civil petitioners.

757
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,297
TRAFFIC CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

758
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,008
I understand, but how is it our job?

759
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:21,721
Eight complaints have already been filed,
but they were all shut down.

760
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,307
I think it's a good idea.

761
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,686
- Why don't you take it to CSU?
- CSU?

762
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,939
Civil Servants' Union.
It's like the police's labor union.

763
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,150
I'll bring it up then.

764
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,027
It's like tying a bell on a cat's neck.

765
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,325
- My goodness.
- Hello, sir.

766
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,785
- All right.
- Hello, sir.

767
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,037
Take a seat.
You don't need to be so formal.

768
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,124
Sit down.
The air conditioner isn't so strong here.

769
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,792
I didn't need to bring my jacket.

770
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,045
Hmm. Where should I sit?

771
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,882
I'll sit here.

772
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,634
- Chief Gu, please come in further.
- That's right.

773
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,304
Why? Is that the best seat?

774
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,182
That's authoritarian, okay?

775
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,267
- Sit down.
- Okay.

776
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,351
All right.

777
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,399
It has been a while.

778
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:19,237
I've been meaning
to have a meeting with the TCI team,

779
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,031
but it took so long.

780
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,451
I'm extremely busy now that I'm the chief.

781
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,244
I'm sure you were disappointed.

782
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,956
Let's drink together
and talk about what's in our hearts

783
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,000
without holding back.

784
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,461
Let's fill our glasses.

785
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,087
I'll do it.

786
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,141
Your name is Cha Yeonho, right?

787
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,810
- Yes, sir.
- I see.

788
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,356
We have a deep connection.

789
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,650
We're sitting side by side today.

790
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,902
Let me pour you a glass.

791
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,740
I don't drink, sir.
I lack enzymes that break down alcohol.

792
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,909
I'll just drink water.

793
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,752
He lacks enzymes that break down alcohol.

794
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,922
Right. You shouldn't drink then.

795
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,301
Let this be the last shot all around.

796
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,594
Bottoms up.

797
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,307
By the way…

798
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,272
I want to use this opportunity
to say something.

799
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,066
It's about my son's DUI.

800
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,821
- Captain Jung.
- What? Oh.

801
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,615
Yes, sir.

802
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,576
You did well.

803
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,620
He's weak-minded.

804
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,082
He's nice,
but he needs to come to his senses.

805
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,752
TCI doesn't cut slack
because he is the chief's son.

806
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,838
It's good. You did well. It's cool.

807
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,506
You did a great job.

808
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,216
Bottoms up.

809
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,679
And about the minor collision
I had with Lieutenant Cha.

810
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,599
Seriously, I learned a lesson.

811
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,477
Without minding
the situation and location,

812
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,188
he pushed through
using the rules and procedures.

813
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,649
I like the youthful spirit.

814
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,192
It's nice.

815
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,360
Drink up.

816
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,285
This restaurant has tasty pork rind. Here.

817
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,912
It's always tasty whenever I eat it.

818
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,831
Eat up.

819
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:40,003
We need to learn from the youngsters
when it comes to spirits.

820
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,421
Isn't that right?

821
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,922
Chief, you know--

822
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,008
Chief, let me pour you a glass.

823
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,636
Gosh,
why do you keep pouring me a drink?

824
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,138
All right.

825
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,396
Gosh, how nice is this?

826
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,150
- Thank you.
- Seocho-dong.

827
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,234
Yes, sir.

828
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,820
I'll get going then.

829
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,490
Cha Yeonho.

830
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,453
Work hard.
I have high expectations for you.

831
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,871
I'll keep my eyes on you.

832
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,832
You should be the ace in TCI.

833
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,168
All right.

834
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,381
Okay.

835
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,717
For goodness' sake.
This is bureaucratic nonsense.

836
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,052
Okay.

837
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,307
Are you going for another round?
Shall I give you my card?

838
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,684
- No, sir.
- All right then.

839
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,687
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

840
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,897
Thank you, sir.

841
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,078
I don't know what he's thinking.
Why is he suddenly being like that?

842
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,996
- Let's go.
- Okay.

843
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,499
If you're going back to the station,
come with me.

844
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,878
You clinked glasses with me earlier.
You had a shot.

845
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,463
It was water.

846
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,799
I didn't drink
since I'm taking oriental medicine.

847
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,926
Are you going to the station?

848
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,428
- Come with me.
- Okay.

849
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,847
Can I ask for a ride too?

850
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,433
- Your place isn't in that direction.
- Sure.

851
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,561
I need to get my bike.
I have something to say too.

852
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,902
Why are you taking oriental medicine?
Are you sick?

853
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,238
Oh, it's a weight-loss medicine.

854
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,614
For goodness' sake.

855
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,074
You don't need to lose weight.

856
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,909
All of those are muscles.

857
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,203
It's true, but I want
to lose a bit of weight.

858
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,788
I want to be agile like you.

859
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,332
Agile? For goodness' sake.

860
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,634
What did you want to say to me?

861
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,846
Why did you stop me earlier?

862
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,141
Oh, that.

863
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,060
Today isn't the only day, right?

864
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,022
The matter regarding the parking space
would look better

865
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,317
if we combine our opinions
at the Civil Servants' Union meeting--

866
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,444
You must've misunderstood.

867
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,821
That wasn't what I was going to say.

868
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,450
I was going to say
that I can't eat pork rind.

869
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,499
Oh, I see. Pork rind.

870
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,502
Right.

871
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,304
What is that?

872
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,474
Hey!

873
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,231
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

874
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,984
Hey, what was that white thing just now?

875
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,194
- You saw it, right?
- Yes.

876
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,029
- You saw it too, right?
- Yes.

877
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,664
Hey.

878
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,463
- What? This place is--
- You're right.

879
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,634
It's the spot from yesterday.
The spot where a drunk driver saw a ghost.

880
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,558
KANGHEE JUNCTION

881
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,533
CRASH

882
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,791
Don't you resent Cha Yeonho?

883
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,002
He's a victim too.

884
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,922
That's very noble of you.

885
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,760
It took me a long time to accept it.

886
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,476
I think he's interested
in becoming a police officer.

887
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,398
That's quite sudden. Did he tell you so?

888
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,071
What do you want me to do? Accept him?

889
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,366
That's your decision to make.

890
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,994
Don't have any unnecessary biases.

891
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,875
Why does he want to become an officer
of all things?

892
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,002
There's something…

893
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,173
he must do.

894
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,231
<i>The wheel turned on its own.</i>

895
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,400
The car spun on its own.

896
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,528
I don't see the soul.
My grandpa says that it's a ghost.

897
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,823
Unable to leave, ghosts haunt this place.

898
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,741
<i>Accidents keep occurring at the same spot.</i>

899
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,576
It's a serious crime.

900
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,453
Two innocent people have died already.

901
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,955
<i>How will we investigate this case?</i>

902
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,081
What if we become the victims?

903
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,416
Oh, my!

904
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,460
Mister, have you seen a ghost?
You really haven't seen it?

905
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,171
<i>The reason</i>
<i>why the road was wet on a clear day.</i>

906
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,258
- I think I know what happened.
- Who are these punks?

907
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,342
What?

908
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,806
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

909
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,933
AN INSURANCE FRAUD
THAT TARGETED COMPENSATION

910
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,018
FOR POLICE INVESTIGATION
AND SETTLEMENT

911
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,274
I'm sure many viewers who
watched today's episode were worried.

912
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,358
CHA YEONHO, TCI

913
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,529
"The insurance compensation regulations
are too lax.

914
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,073
I hope criminals don't take notes."

915
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,825
For those people,

916
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,287
I'll give a brief explanation
of police investigation compensation.

917
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,334
The incident in the drama
was based on a real-life case

918
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,503
which took place in 2007.

919
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,550
The culprit murdered two elderly women
by running them over

920
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,219
and gravely injured one elderly woman.

921
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,180
He masked them as involuntary manslaughter

922
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,807
and succeeded in receiving
insurance compensation.

923
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:55,062
But the year after the cases closed,
it was revealed to be a serial murder.

924
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,191
The culprit received a prison sentence
of 15 years.

925
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,068
This case became an important trigger

926
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:05,490
to find a way to stop
similar insurance frauds from happening.

927
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,915
After the sentence, insurance policies
underwent major changes twice.

928
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,293
Now, even if the driver
has multiple insurance plans,

929
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:21,506
he or she cannot receive more
than the actual sum of the settlement.

930
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:26,219
The settlement money is delivered directly
to the victim from the insurance company.

931
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,806
Thus, the policies have been changed
to prevent a driver from causing accidents

932
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,267
in the hope of making a profit
from the compensation for settlement.

933
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,440
A crime
for the police investigation compensation

934
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:43,277
should no longer be feasible,
nor should it even be considered.

935
