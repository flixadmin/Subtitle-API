- Not this down-to-earth.

about her controversial speech.

Was it a breakdown

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,771
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

35

You look familiar.

- She's, uh, new in town.

66
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,249
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

67
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,671
So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

Mmm.

So, uh, Gretchen Scaramucci...

70
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,593
- No, no. (GROANS)
- ... she was bigger

71
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,595
than all the guys. Like,

72
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,264
André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

73
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,434
she wants to beat the
living fuck out of this guy

74

about her girlfriend...

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,677
None of them? They're all just
kids dosed with the blue shit.

167
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:14,887
I mean, even...

168
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,097
Even fucking Starlight.

169
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,645
Do you think... do
you think they know...

170
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,814
what really happened to 'em?

171
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,233
What about Homelander?

172
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,485
Homelander's a black hole.

173
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,570
Never had any public
records and never will.

174
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,447
However, every single other Supe...

175
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,157
juiced-up lab rats.

176
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:36,450
My God.

177
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,659
I'm trying to give

178
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,246
a tremendous fucking TED
Talk here, and this...

179
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,873
Frenchie, can you control her, please?

180
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,875
I do not control her.

181
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,377
(SCOFFS)

182
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:47,878
Do you see what I'm dealing with?

183
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,463
Well, spot on, M.M.

184
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,674
We got Vought for child
endangerment, drug trafficking,

185
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,678
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

186
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,014
Raynor's gonna love it.

187
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,682
MOTHER'S MILK: You
better hope she does...

188
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,644
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

189
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,356
Uh, hi.

190
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,569
- (SNARLS)
- FRENCHIE: Hughie, no!

191
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,154
(CLICKING TONGUE) No, no, no.

192
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,324
Not if you're attached to that hand, no.

193
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,618
It's okay. Yeah.

194
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:23,372
Well, you know, all of this, uh, it's...

195
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:26,208
But it's only part of the story, no?

196
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,711
I mean, what about our
petite Lazarus here?

197
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,046
She's not an infant.

198
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,299
And she was injected in a
basement, not a hospital.

199
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,302
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

200
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,638
Well, your feral pixie dream
girl ain't exactly dictating

201
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,598
her fucking memoirs, is she, Frenchie?

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,809
I'm feeling she's trying to communicate.

203
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,562
I mean, she's been doing this for...

204
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:48,355
Maybe that means something, huh?

205
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,606
Yeah, maybe they're just
fucking chicken scratches.

206
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,650
- Let's find out.
- Nah, you've been burned.

207
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,152
It's not safe out there for you.

208
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,487
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

209
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:56,572
(SCOFFS)

210
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,782
Fantastique.

211
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,826
- All right, I'm off.
- HUGHIE: Okay.

212
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,622
I'll just, uh, keep on
Starlight then, right?

213
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,459
Her phone's been tits-up for a week.

214
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,962
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

215
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,298
No.

216
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,926
But I can, uh... I can check.

217
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,723
All right.

218
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:23,892
You're with me.

219
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,435
- He is?
- I am?

220
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,978
What, to the CIA lady?

221
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,315
No. We're gonna go on a little detour.

222
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:33,567
- You'll love it.
- (PATTING)

223
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,403
Come on.

224
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,697
ASHLEY: No, I have
been working with her!

225
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:41,325
I've been fucking working
with her! I can't believe this.

226
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,327
Who the fuck are you
gonna get to replace me?

227
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,788
I'd like to see what bitch that is!

228
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,166
You okay?

229
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,210
(CHUCKLES RUEFULLY)

230
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,045
(EXHALES)

231
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,048
You know that pledge you
mentor during rush week

232
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,467
because she seems
sweet and a little naive

233
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,720
and she doesn't know she's
not supposed to wear UGGs?

234
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,679
(CHUCKLES) And then, once she's active,

235
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,139
she stabs you in the back,

236
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,391
gets you kicked out of the house?

237
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,685
(SCOFFS)

238
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:09,811
- I'm sorry. I don't...
- It was

239
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:12,606
my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

240
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,275
What could go wrong, I thought.

241
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,446
You were playing to your base.

242
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,992
At least I don't have to kiss
your ass anymore.

243
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:27,621
(KNOCKING)

244
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:30,374
Come in.

245
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,042
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

246
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,836
You fired Ashley?

247
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:36,838
It was actually a mutual decision.

248
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,508
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

249
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,510
and, um, we wished her well.

250
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,929
So, I would like you to take this

251
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,057
in the constructive
spirit that it is intended.

252
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:49,017
Okay.

253
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:53,063
You are a selfish, arrogant child.

254
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,481
Wow.

255
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,149
Back in Iowa,

256
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,695
I bet you watched a lot of
Queen Maeve's movies, right?

257
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,154
I did.

258
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,739
She was a rebel.

259
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,157
Didn't take anyone's shit,

260
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,576
didn't play by the rules.

261
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:06,910
That's what you wanted to be.

262
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,037
That's what American heroes are.

263
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,789
But it's a myth.

264
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,334
I should know, because I wrote it.

265
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,670
The truth is,

266
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,839
dozens of people in this company

267
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,841
spent hundreds of hours

268
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,969
to create the thing that is you.

269
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,263
I never asked for that.

270
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:29,683
Then why don't you
burn the sparkly outfit

271
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,603
and become a cop?

272
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,439
You want to be a superhero.

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,442
You want to be famous.

274
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,861
But nobody's famous alone.

275
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:45,699
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

276
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,701
show a little fucking gratitude,

277
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,537
and let us do our job?

278
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:57,964
No.

279
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,716
I mean, I don't mean to be ungrateful.

281
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:05,969
But... no red carpets,

282
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,888
no reality TV,

283
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,724
and no Noxzema commercials.

284
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,144
And I want my old uniform back.

285
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,146
I'm gonna save people.

286
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,940
Then I think we may need to reconsider

287
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,319
your position in The Seven.

288
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,489
And I think that firing an employee

289
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,742
after she reported
sexual assault on live TV

290
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,578
might tank your stock price.

291
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,749
(SIGHS) Well, I hope we can
count on your discretion.

292
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,752
I'm sorry, I don't
do discretion anymore.

293
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:42,089
If anyone asks me who did
it, I'm gonna answer honestly.

294
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,175
Well, I think it's great that
you want to tell the truth.

295
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,678
I just don't know to
whom you're referring.

296
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,097
Oh, I think you know.

297
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,851
I think you've known for a long time.

298
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:59,022
Thank you so much for coming, Starlight.

299
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:00,817
I have a lot to think about.

300
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,239
(DOOR OPENS)

301
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,990
(DOOR CLOSES)

302
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,993
(GLASS BREAKING)

303
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,874
Okay.

304
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,210
I mean, you take
Tek-Knight's Knightracer?

305
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,462
Had a carbon footprint
the size of a 727.

306
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,589
The thing literally shot fire.

307
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,800
Thanks to me, now he drives a hybrid.

308
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,010
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

309
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:33,099
To respect what's, what's
beautiful in the world.

310
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,311
- What's up?
- Hi.

311
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:43,400
So... everything.

312
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,193
(SIGHS) So beautiful.

313
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:46,695
COURTENAY: Good. Let's reset.

314
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,405
Trash back on the beach, please.

315
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,407
Background, put the
trash back on the beach.

316
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,033
All right.

317
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:55,078
Um, well, we lost my dad at a young age,

318
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,788
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

319
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,124
so, it was, uh, my
older brother Nathan who,

320
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,251
who pretty much raised me up.

321
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:03,336
And when I was three, it's
like these guys started shooting

322
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,046
in front of my building

323
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,882
and I outran the damn bullet. (LAUGHS)

324
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,467
That's kinda how I figured out...

325
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:10,108
Can I, can I stop you
right there for a second?

326
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,929

out, which, tragically,

to hum the Spice Girls.

674
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,598
Drove me round the
fucking bend, you know.

walking around the house, humming.

677
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,897
She was happy.

678
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,400
Now, fuck know why she
was happy with me, but...

679
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,321
she was happy.

680
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:27,771
Homelander raped her.

681
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:37,390
Jesus.

682
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,815
I-I'm sorry.

683
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:57,410
Not long after that, she
came and sat right here.

684
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,705
I know this 'cause she got tagged

685
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,667
in that security camera right there.

686
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:12,509
She sat here for three hours.

687
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,930
Didn't move a muscle.

688
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,521
Then she just got up and walked away.

689
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,946
That was eight years ago.

690
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,491
And nobody's seen her since.

691
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:42,538
Either Homelander killed her

692
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,542
or she killed herself. Same difference.

709

Well, I moved around a lot,

710
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,607
so, uh, it was a bunch of condos.

711
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:36,110
So, what if I took you to a house

712
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:39,989
you'd never seen before, full of photos

713

714

716
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,875
And then I asked you

717
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:56,006
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

718

734

... you found me.

1133
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:55,449
BUTCHER: Hughie.

1134
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:59,994
I thought that was you.

1135
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:01,996
Ha. Oh.

1136
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:03,414
Oh, I apologize.

1137
00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:04,874
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1138
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,292
No. (CHUCKLES)

1139
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:07,960
Hi, I'm Annie.

1140
00:56:07,961 --> 00:56:09,628
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

1141
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:11,213
Ah, boy, you really...

1142
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,299
You have a lot of
friends showing up here.

1143
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,092
Yeah.

1144
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:16,510
Seems like it.

1145
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:20,014
You're that new girl
in The Seven, ain't you?

1146
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,557
Guilty.

1147
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:23,642
Wow. It is a pleasure to meet you.

1148
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:25,686
And I must say how marvelous it is

1149
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,230
that so many more women
are in positions of power.

1150
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:29,940
- You know what I mean?
- Mm.

1151
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:33,235
You know, i-if I'm perfectly honest,

1152
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:36,155
Translucent's always been my favorite.

1153
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:37,948
What's he up to?

1154
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:40,284
I think he's on a mission.

1155
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:42,745
BUTCHER: Huh. Yeah, I
think I read that, actually.

1156
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,663
He's been gone a long
time, though, hasn't he?

1157
00:56:44,664 --> 00:56:47,459
I do hope he's all right.

1158
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:50,169
You know what?

1159
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,171
I'm gonna go... get us a pitcher.

1160
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:54,548
- Ah.
- Billy, you like...

1161
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:55,966
Let me guess. Guinness?

1162
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:58,094
- I like what you like.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

1163
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,389
All right. Be right back.

1164
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:04,725
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

1165
00:57:04,726 --> 00:57:07,186
She's quite tasty up close and personal.

1166
00:57:07,187 --> 00:57:09,313
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

1167
00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:11,315
I thought we had an understanding.

1168
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:12,691
We do. We do.

1169
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:15,528
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

1170
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:17,822
'Cause from where I'm
sitting, it looks like

1171
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,866
you've got your tongue halfway
down the opposition's throat.

1172
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:23,120
She is not the opposition.

1173
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:27,665
She's a good person, okay?

1174
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,999
I mean, she could help us.

1175
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,877
- Help us?
- Yeah.

1176
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:35,756
And what do you think she's gonna do

1177
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,718
when she finds out you
murdered Translucent?

1178
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:42,389
When she finds out?

1179
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:49,520
Give her my best.

1180
00:57:49,521 --> 00:57:51,523
