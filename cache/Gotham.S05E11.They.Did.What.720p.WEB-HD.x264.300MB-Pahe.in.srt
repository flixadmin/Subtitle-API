1
00:00:01,175 --> 00:00:02,480
Previously onGotham...

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:03,873
General Wade's
landing craft docked.

3
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,657
His convoy's
on the way here now.

4
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,659
Reunification day is today.

5
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,531
Captain Gordon.General, welcome to Gotham.

6
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,054
Incoming!

7
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,012
Get back!

8
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:16,755
[filtered breathing]

9
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:25,025
Eduardo.
What did Walker do to you?

10
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,330
Eduardo's dead, Jim.

11
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,940
There is only Bane now.

12
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:31,683
Everything I have done here
is about punishing Gotham

13
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:34,338
for the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

14
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:35,426
I'm not leaving.

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,862
And I don't
think I can

16
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,039
let you leave... either.

17
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:40,170
What are you doing?

18
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,737
[grunting]

19
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:44,696
Ra's al Ghul.

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,523
This is revenge

21
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,698
for his death.

22
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:47,612
And who am I?

23
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,874
You're his daughter.

24
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,746
[grunting]

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,226
[shouting]

26
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:54,967
Barbara Kean.

27
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,708
Run!

28
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,884
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

29
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,756
I believe
you knew my father.

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,192
Where's Nyssa?I don't know,

31
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,193
but she's planning
on using the military

32
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,194
to wipe out Gotham.

33
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,804
I can order them to stand down.

34
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:06,762
Then let's get you
out of here.

35
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,200
This is General Wade.

36
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,462
Begin your
bombing run

37
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,463
on my order.
Wait, wait.

38
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:19,253
[explosions in distance]

39
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,299
[helicopter blades whirring]

40
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,258
[indistinct chatter]

41
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,925
GORDON:
We need to get ahold of Barbara.

42
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,666
Nyssa al Ghul's coming for her.

43
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,147
The sooner she and Lee get back
here with the baby, the better.

44
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,801
LUCIUS: We got refugees coming
in from all over Gotham, Jim.

45
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:46,932
People are scared.

46
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,543
I know you're
not one to quit,

47
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,022
but if there was ever a time
to wave the white flag,

48
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,546
now is it.

49
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,157
Nyssa al Ghul doesn't want
to just conquer Gotham--

50
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,941
she wants to destroy it,

51
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,682
kill everyone she finds.

52
00:01:57,726 --> 00:02:00,685
The only thing standing between
her and these people is us.

53
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,339
Gather the team.

54
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,036
Get every able-bodied refugee

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,778
down into the bunkers
beneath the GCPD.

56
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:09,172
Why do I get the feeling
he's concocting

57
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,609
an elaborate plan
to get us all killed?

58
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,482
Better gather up
these refugees.

59
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,966
Look at him.

60
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,405
The medics did everything
they could to stabilize him.

61
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,931
Now all we can do is wait.

62
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,282
This is my fault.

63
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,505
I sent him on this mission.

64
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:40,247
Alfred knew what he
was signing up for, Bruce.

65
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,640
We all did.

66
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,991
Nyssa and Bane
are coming after me and Barbara.

67
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,646
Coming after Gotham.

68
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,650
Because of what
we did to Ra's.

69
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:56,176
What you did was stop him.

70
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,830
Twice.

71
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:02,356
We'll stop his psycho
daughter together.

72
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:13,193
I'm sure you
recognize this knife.

73
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,152
You touch my baby,

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,719
and I will turn you
into a pile of ash,

75
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,547
just like I did your father.

76
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,724
A bit cruel, don't you think?

77
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,379
To let this little one
get too attached

78
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,902
when you won't be around

79
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,077
much longer.

80
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,426
[shudders]
Mmm.

81
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,211
[cooing]

82
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,604
Soon, you and Bruce Wayne

83
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,432
will see Gotham

84
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:39,784
and Jim Gordon's precious
Green Zone destroyed.

85
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,092
Then I'll allow you to die.

86
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:47,009
My father made his name
destroying empires.

87
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,794
Now it's my turn.

88
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,277
[panting]
Hello.

89
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,845
Listen to me.
There is a submarine

90
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,673
in the docks,
full of Gotham's gold.

91
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,848
It's yours.

92
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,676
Just leave the city.

93
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,634
Let me and my baby go.

94
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,768
[cooing]No.

95
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,424
I think I'll keep
this little one

96
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,470
and raise her as my own.

97
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,560
As an al Ghul.

98
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,127
[laughing]

99
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,306
I take it the army has landed.

100
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,177
They're just awaiting
my orders.

101
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,179
Then what are you waiting for?

102
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:34,491
What a cute
little baby.

103
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,581
[indistinct chatter]

104
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,767
Wait, what?

105
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,769
You're ordering us to destroy
the Green Zone?

106
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:54,555
Anyone still in Gotham
is an enemy of the state.

107
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,470
I won't be party to the murder
of civilians, General.

108
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:59,473
Then you're relieved
of command.

109
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,344
The hell are you?

110
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,432
[filtered breathing]

111
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,955
I'm your new commander.

112
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,306
[snap]

113
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,092
Does anybody else have a problem
with the general's orders?

114
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,355
Good.

115
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,705
Let's get started.

116
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,099
â™ª

117
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,373
What's the matter?

118
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:34,377
Can we really be so cavalier
about the destruction of Gotham?

119
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,988
[sighs]
Let me think about that.

120
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:37,902
Yes!

121
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,339
[groans]

122
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,123
Damn it!

123
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,603
Oswald!

124
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:43,952
Where are you going?

125
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,432
Oswald!

126
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,217
This is my city,
and I will be damned

127
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,175
if I'm gonna let
those bastards take it!

128
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,655
I cannot let you do this.

129
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,091
You, of all people,

130
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,616
should want to stop
those monsters.

131
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,879
They forced you
to destroy Haven,

132
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,229
to murder hundreds
of innocent civilians.

133
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,405
You're just gonna let
'em get away with it?

134
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,015
I was kind of planning on it,
yeah.

135
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,756
Very well.

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,411
I'm going to follow my heart.

137
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,239
Oswald!

138
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,721
You have been down
this road before.

139
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:17,594
Following your heart has
never worked out for you.

140
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,555
Perhaps.

141
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,208
But perhaps
you could learn something

142
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,210
if you listened
to this

143
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,212
instead of this.

144
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,216
I'm gonna miss you,

145
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,610
Edward.
[crying]

146
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,307
I'll miss you, too, Oswald.

147
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm not talking to you.

148
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm talking to the...

149
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,836
God!

150
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,925
[chuckles]
Come on, baby.

151
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,666
All right.

152
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,667
Okay.

153
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,103
Good boy.

154
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,717
[panting]

155
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,719
Go with the man
in green.

156
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,068
[shuddering inhale]

157
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,722
You'll be safe.

158
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,943
Oswald, if you
walk off this dock,

159
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,945
I'm taking
this submarine.[sniffles, exhales]

160
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,947
And the treasure!

161
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,949
Nyssa al Ghul wants
to kill everyone in Gotham.

162
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,518
But, to get to us, the army has
to follow the Western Corridor.

163
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:12,954
That's where we make a stand.

164
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,042
We got a handful of men.

165
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,565
How are we gonna
take on an army?

166
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,915
We just have to slow
the army down long enough

167
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,440
to get General Wade out
from under Nyssa's control.

168
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,224
Then he can reverse
the invasion order.

169
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,574
We're trying
to reach the Sirens.

170
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,532
Still no luck.

171
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,098
All right. I'll go.

172
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,491
Jim.

173
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,188
I need to get Barbara
and Lee back here.

174
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,364
I'll meet you at the barricades.I know you haven't seen

175
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,584
your kid yet,
but the GCPD needs a leader,

176
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,499
and they're looking to you.

177
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,674
I'll go to Sirens.

178
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,328
Okay.

179
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,767
[siren wailing in distance]

180
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,380
You sure
you want to do this?

181
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,471
It doesn't take two of us
to track the general's signal.

182
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,864
And if Jim's making a stand,
that's where I should be.

183
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:54,865
Okay.

184
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,346
Wayne Enterprises EMP,

185
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,088
smoke bombs,
signal jammers.

186
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,090
Not enough to even the odds,
but...

187
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,700
it may buy you some time.

188
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:04,962
What's this?

189
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:08,749
Ah. Remember
the Nightwing Project?

190
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,447
Portable, next-gen stealth tech.

191
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,102
Put it on any aircraft,
and it's invisible to radar.

192
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,539
But, unfortunately, it also
seems to serve as a beacon

193
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,236
to certain animals.

194
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,455
Never know.

195
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,804
Might find a use for it.

196
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,508
Oswald, come in.

197
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,074
[chuckles]

198
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,164
Still have those eyes in
the back of your head, Jim.

199
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,905
No.
[sighs]

200
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:38,256
You just have
a remarkably recognizable odor.

201
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,998
Part dandy,
part snake.

202
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,826
After all these years,
it hasn't changed.

203
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,262
Drink?

204
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,916
No, thank you.

205
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,657
Dulls the senses.

206
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,833
That's what I was going for.

207
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,141
Surprised
you're still here.

208
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,709
Figured you'd be
long gone by now.

209
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:59,190
That storm you've warned me
about for so long,

210
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,889
it's finally here.

211
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:08,286
We've shared
some turbulent times, you and I.

212
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,288
That we have.

213
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,290
When you spared my life
on the pier that day,

214
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,119
banished me from Gotham,

215
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,861
that was the most lost
I've ever been.

216
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,341
[chuckles]

217
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,822
Because I was away
from the city, you see.

218
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,910
[chuckles]

219
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,566
It's part of me.

220
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,306
You know what I'm talking about,

221
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,047
because it's part
of you, too.

222
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,701
[chuckles]

223
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,311
Sure, I could escape--

224
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,486
with money, I might add--

225
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,488
but then what?

226
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,142
Stand on the shores
of the mainland

227
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:40,710
and watch the army burn it
to the ground?

228
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,408
Then watch tasteless
industrialists

229
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,237
and vapid politicians
rebuild it?

230
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,238
[chuckles]

231
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,066
No.

232
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,417
My life is etched on the walls
of every alley

233
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:54,811
and dirty warehouse here.

234
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:59,294
My blood lives
in its broken concrete.

235
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,777
I'm staying to fight.

236
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,866
For my legacy.

237
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:06,823
BULLOCK:
Hey.

238
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,261
The army just busted
through the GCPD checkpoint.

239
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:12,263
They're heading
to the barricades.

240
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,613
Bane's leading them.

241
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,701
How many men?

242
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,441
[sighs]
600, 700?

243
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,661
Still want to fight?[gulps]

244
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,141
How many do we have?

245
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,055
Maybe 30?

246
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:21,969
[laughs]

247
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,623
Thirty-one.

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,191
Takes two men to pilot
that submarine, Oswald.

249
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,192
The dog can't do it.

250
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,629
[exhales]

251
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,718
Ditto on that blood
and concrete thing.

252
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,721
Kind of like this city
the way it is.

253
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,592
Shall we?

254
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,681
I believe
time is of the essence.

255
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,465
Gentlemen.

256
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,294
Remind me to talk to you
about that full pardon.

257
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,299
â™ª

258
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,411
Alvarez!

259
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,152
Harper, Bruce!

260
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,937
You take the left flank.

261
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,678
Harvey and I will
take the right.

262
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,941
Holy Mary, Mother and Joseph.

263
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,469
BANE:
Captain Gordon...

264
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,080
I always knew you had
a savior complex,

265
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:31,865
but this is too much.

266
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,215
What happened to you, Eduardo?

267
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,869
There was a time
when you would have been up

268
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,479
on these barricades with me.

269
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:42,440
Yes... but that was before
I found my true purpose.

270
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,573
Stand by.

271
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,576
Fire on my command.

272
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,752
Jim, it's a lot
of innocent soldiers

273
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,580
down there
just following orders.

274
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:55,236
Target Bane
and Nyssa's commandos.

275
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,673
Fire on my command.

276
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,979
For Gotham.

277
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,340
[groans]

278
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,342
SELINA:
Lee?

279
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,996
[gunfire in distance]

280
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,345
Selina.

281
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,130
Hey. Come on, we got
to get out of here.

282
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,698
Where's Barbara
and the baby?

283
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,613
[exhales]
Nyssa al Ghul took them.

284
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,180
We have to tell Jim.

285
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,442
Yeah.

286
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,400
[gunfire continues]

287
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,710
The Narrows.

288
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,935
They never stood
a chance.

289
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,721
The ones who could
escaped to the GCPD.

290
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,028
Then that's where
I'm needed.

291
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,338
[grunts]

292
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,998
[grenade whistling]

293
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,308
Target Jim Gordon.[grunts]

294
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,613
I'm sorry! I don't
think he can hear you

295
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,311
through the bullet
in his ear!

296
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,791
[groans]

297
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,970
Eddie!

298
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,712
[screaming]

299
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,891
They're only delaying
the inevitable.

300
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:28,633
Jim, that thing's
pointing right at us!

301
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,725
[groans]

302
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,205
BANE:
Go, go, go, go, go!

303
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,257
Find me Jim Gordon
and Bruce Wayne.

304
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,781
If the army gets through
the barricades,

305
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,870
they'll have a straight shot to
the GCPD and the people there.

306
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,046
We need to find another way
to slow them down.

307
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,656
I think I have a way.

308
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,225
GORDON:
Gather all the ammunition
you can.

309
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,227
Fall back to the GCPD.

310
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,707
Go, go now!

311
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,926
Fall back!

312
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,363
We got to go.[grunts]

313
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,766
Well, that was a disaster.

314
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,986
Come on, Oswald,
we have to keep moving.

315
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,033
Where? There's
nowhere to hide, Jim.

316
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,296
Wherever we go,
the army will find us.

317
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,863
LUCIUS [over radio]:
Get me Gordon.

318
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,343
It's Lucius.

319
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,128
Tell me you were able
to track the general's signal.

320
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,913
It's coming from City Hall,
but there's a problem.

321
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,654
Selina radioed.

322
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:36,136
Barbara and the baby were
kidnapped by Nyssa al Ghul.

323
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,007
General Wade's at City Hall.

324
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,488
Chances are Nyssa, Barbara
and the baby are, too.

325
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,056
Our best bet is for me to sneak
into City Hall alone.

326
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,754
One good electrical zap should
short out the general's chip,

327
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,843
then you can get him
to reverse the invasion order.

328
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,498
See you back at the GCPD.

329
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,979
Get Barbara and
the baby back safe.

330
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,981
Come on. Hey, move!

331
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,722
Upsy-daisy, Oswald.[Oswald grunting]

332
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,246
We're running
out of time.

333
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,814
[gasps]
Just give me one minute.

334
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:05,295
I'm so sorry.

335
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,081
I saw the grenade
and I froze.
[exhales]

336
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,647
I'm sor...
Shh.

337
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,216
It's the least I could do.

338
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,176
But tell me...

339
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,702
Does it look bad?

340
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
No, it's just
a scr... [gags]

341
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,838
Looks fine. Let's go.

342
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,711
Where'd everybody go?

343
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,931
She's gonna need some morphine.

344
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:32,932
[explosion]

345
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,196
And this bandage needs changing.

346
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,154
Lee.

347
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,286
Bruce.
Is Jim...?

348
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,244
He's okay. For now.

349
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,203
We'll need to get Jeremiah's
battery from the basement.

350
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,684
After the bridges went down,
Lucius re-modified

351
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,557
Jeremiah's bomb to be used
for its original purpose...

352
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,602
as a battery.

353
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,300
It's been powering
the GCPD.

354
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,823
Right.

355
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,043
We need to make
it a bomb again.

356
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,783
You got to be kidding me.

357
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,308
Jeremiah knew exactly
where to put his bombs

358
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,571
to topple buildings,
turn Gotham into a maze.

359
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,007
We stopped him.

360
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,096
But if we could use
just part of his plan,

361
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,098
we can track the army
and slow them down.

362
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,057
By knocking buildings down
like dominos.

363
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,798
But for that to work, we need
to put a bomb in this building.

364
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,236
Ground Zero for the blast.

365
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,020
Wayne Enterprises.

366
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,456
Bruce...

367
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,894
There's no other way.

368
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:26,333
Okay. How do we get
this thing out of here?

369
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,422
To use it as a bomb,
you don't need the whole thing.

370
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:32,121
All you need is... the core...

371
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,516
and the activator.

372
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,474
[electricity powering down]

373
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,477
That's it?

374
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,913
It may look modest,

375
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,480
but all it took was one of these

376
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:44,873
to blow up an
entire bridge.

377
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,396
Not to mention the
Gotham Clock Tower.

378
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,311
Bruce, you can't
do this alone.

379
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,791
He's not alone.

380
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,271
I know where to place the bomb.

381
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,577
And you and Lucius
are needed here.

382
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,457
I can't believe
we're letting them do this.

383
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,024
Add that to the list

384
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,027
of things that I cannot
believe are happening.

385
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:17,558
Hey.

386
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,125
What?

387
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,910
[grunting]

388
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:22,998
[snap]

389
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,481
BARBARA:
The key's there.

390
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,010
Where is she? Is she okay?

391
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,142
Yeah, she's upstairs
in the office

392
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,492
with Nyssa and
the general.

393
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,798
Nyssa is not gonna stop until
she's killed everyone in Gotham.

394
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,801
One thing at a time,
let's go save our baby.

395
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,239
NYSSA:
Hello, Captain Gordon.

396
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,893
[guns cocking]

397
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,157
Ah.

398
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,030
You're seeing your baby
for the first time.

399
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,292
[sighs]

400
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,468
I wish I had a camera.

401
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,600
Hand her over.

402
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,601
No.

403
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:03,908
I don't think I will.

404
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,910
Put down your guns.

405
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:10,089
Unless you want the little
one hurt in the crossfire.

406
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:12,743
[chuckles]

407
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,098
Even now, the army is making
its way to the Green Zone

408
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,751
while Bane is hunting down
Bruce Wayne.

409
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,015
Only question is,

410
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,106
what to do with you?

411
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,764
This is it.

412
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,418
The bomb will weaken
the support column

413
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,941
and topple the
entire building.

414
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,466
This is crazy.

415
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:42,512
I mean, we've spent this entire
time trying to stop Jeremiah

416
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,340
and now we're actually using
part of his plan.

417
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,344
Believe me...

418
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,694
if there was any other way...

419
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,828
SELINA:
You sure you want to do this?

420
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,092
First Wayne Manor gets destroyed

421
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,355
and now Wayne Enterprises.

422
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:02,271
This building is the heart
of my family's company.

423
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,881
There are things above us

424
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:07,798
my parents spent
their entire lives on.

425
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,757
Some of my earliest memories

426
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,411
are playing with Alfred
in this lobby,

427
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,630
waiting for my parents
to come down these escalators.

428
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:16,242
But my parents
built this company

429
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,461
to make Gotham a better place.

430
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:24,119
They would have sacrificed
everything for this city.

431
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,078
They did sacrifice
everything.

432
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,955
And if that's what it takes...

433
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,091
...so will I.

434
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,182
[exhales]

435
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,488
SELINA:
So remind me
how this works.

436
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:48,099
Pulls energy from the air
and magnifies it.

437
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,060
And when it does that?

438
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:53,017
We run!

439
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,563
[clamoring]

440
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,002
[screaming]

441
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,225
â™ª

442
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,584
I knew you'd come
for your child.

443
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,063
I just didn't think
you'd be foolish enough

444
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,761
to come alone.

445
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,502
I don't need help
to take you down.

446
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,113
Don't you see?

447
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,158
It's over.

448
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:48,769
Gotham will burn.

449
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,728
And I'll achieve
what my father couldn't.

450
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,514
Including killing you.

451
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,298
[chuckles]

452
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,909
She likes to be held upright.

453
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,824
[baby cooing]There.

454
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:05,612
Barbara, I'll deal with you
once Gotham has been destroyed.

455
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,788
But I'd like you
to see this.

456
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:12,445
[both grunting]

457
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:26,807
I was expecting
a little more gusto.

458
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,417
You want gusto?

459
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,986
[both grunt]

460
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,163
Is that all you got?[radio beeping]

461
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,210
It's Lieutenant Angel.

462
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,780
They did what?

463
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,739
No, no.

464
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,828
Is there another
way around?

465
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:49,786
Then tell the army

466
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,353
to blast through.

467
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,224
GORDON:
Hey.

468
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,575
I'm not done with you yet.

469
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,664
Your friends
may have bought you some time,

470
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,667
but the Green Zone's destruction
is only delayed.

471
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,974
And now to meet your fate.

472
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,020
[handcuffs close]Let's meet it together.

474
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:09,893
Barbara!

00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,199
[Gordon screams]

00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,028
[gunfire]

477
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:14,811
Shoot him.

478
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:16,813
No.

479
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,555
[grunting]

480
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,910
You think you can defeat me?

481
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,522
Better men and women
have tried and failed.

482
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,350
[grunting]

483
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:34,918
[shouts]

484
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,923
I'm an al Ghul.

485
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,362
You'll never beat me; I have
my father's blood in my veins.

486
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,233
I am his one true heir.

487
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,930
Do you ever stop talking?

488
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,152
[cries out]

489
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,502
You two do share
one thing.

490
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:58,594
You both love getting
stabbed by this knife.

491
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,161
General Wade.

492
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,731
Execute fail-safe.

493
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,475
No.

494
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:21,269
I'm going to enjoy watching
Gotham be destroyed!

495
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:24,185
And then my legacy
will be complete.

496
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,370
We got to hurry.

497
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,459
It's only a matter of time
before the army breaks through.

498
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,505
We need to get back to the GCPD.[grunts]

499
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,379
Impressive. You blew up
your father's building

500
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,946
to stop the military.

501
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,469
It will take more
to stop me.

502
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:48,470
Go on ahead, Selina!

503
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:49,602
Warn the GCPD!

504
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,647
No, we're doing this
together.

505
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:15,497
You shouldn't have hurt Alfred.

506
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,934
Collateral damage.
It happens in war.

507
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,552
I'm sorry you weren't there
to see me break your butler,

508
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,816
but I'm so glad you won't miss
me killing your little friend.

509
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,861
Let her go.

510
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,255
In war, there are
no attachments.

511
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,300
Only then can you fight
without your hands tied.

512
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:40,609
You see... just a little ounce
of pressure.

513
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,872
That's all that separates
the living from the dead.

BRUCE:
Wayne cloaking device,
but it had some glitches.

518
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,103
Apparently, it's a beacon
for certain winged mammals.

519
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,496

What winged mammals?

There's no way to reverse
the invasion order.

525
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,493
We have to find another way.

526
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,713
Is she all right?She is now.

527
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,629
There, there. Mama's here.[baby cooing]

528
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,157

Come on.

she's fine.

Where's General Wade?
The army's broken through.

00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:49,303
Nyssa al Ghul escaped.
There's no way

543
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:50,783
to order the army to stand down.

544
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,611
So, now what?

545
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,265
The army blew up
Wayne Enterprises

546
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,659
and knocked down
two other buildings.

547
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,574
We don't stand a chance.

548
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,402
Actually, that was
Bruce and Selina.

549
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,925
What?

550
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,492
The army's blocks away.

551
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,363
GORDON:
From what direction?Every direction.

552
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,364
We're surrounded.

553
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,368
Jim. I need to get her
out of here.

554
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:14,937
All right. The tunnels
underneath the GCPD.

555
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,548
There's a vent shaft, it
connects to the subway line.

556
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:21,335
Take the baby and the refugees
down into the subways.

557
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,989
Get 'em behind enemy lines.

558
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,860
Don't stop till
you get to safety.
Okay.

559
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,906
But what about you?

560
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,432
We'll hold 'em off outside,
buy you some time.

561
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,955
Jim...These refugees,

562
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,261
most of them are
from the Narrows.

563
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,697
They know you, they trust you.

564
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,874
They know you'll
protect them.

565
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,702
Go.

566
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:52,714
Oh, there you are,
Master Bruce.

567
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,195
Rest, Alfred.

568
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:59,373
All this time,
I tried to protect you.

569
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,463
There you are,
a soldier.

570
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:06,075
A soldier for good.

571
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,035
You've spent your life
protecting me.

572
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,125
Now it's time for me
to do the same.

573
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,997
It's time for me
to protect Gotham.

574
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,434
Even if there's nothing left
to defend.

575
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,099
All right, everyone,
let's move. Okay.

576
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,623
All right, you'll walk
about five blocks underground,

577
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,626
and then you'll get
to a subway vent. Go.

578
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:39,848
You're not coming with us?

579
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,590
Jim and our friends are
out there making a stand.

580
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,939
That's where I belong.

581
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,724
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

582
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,771
Survive. Make sure this
was all worth it. Go.

583
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,475
What was that for?

584
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,173
Everything you've done
for me.

585
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,001
And for her.

586
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:03,959
Just get them to safety.

587
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,248
It's over, Jim.

588
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,947
Our war's come to an end.

589
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,212
This isn't a war.
This is a firing squad.

590
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,086
I told you to go.

591
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,392
And I didn't listen.

592
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,959
Ready.

593
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:47,960
[panting]

594
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,701
Aim.

595
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,660
[rifles cocking]

596
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,404
MAN:
Shoulder to shoulder.

597
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,971
-Stand together.
-What the...?

598
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:05,804
They're here for us, Jim.

599
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,946
Fire.

600
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,687
[crowd quiets]

601
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,430
I said fire!

602
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,215
GORDON:
You have a choice.

603
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,829
You can stand with us,
or you can stand with them.

604
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,851
[crowd cheering]

605
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,910
CROWD [chanting]:
We are Gotham!

606
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,957
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

607
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,528
[coughing]

608
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:27,755
So that bitch was telling
the truth after all.

609
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,153
[dog barking]

610
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,730
LUCIUS:
We managed to raise
the mainland on the radio.

611
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,297
They know everything.
As of right now,

612
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,951
the army's being repurposed

613
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,258
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

614
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,478
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

615
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,828
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

616
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,787
I'll be damned.

617
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,702
Hey.

618
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:05,793
So...

619
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,187
this whole
"not listening" thing.

620
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,710
It's not gonna become
a habit, is it?

621
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,060
You're welcome.

622
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,200
Go.

623
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:30,296
[chuckles softly]

624
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,514
Well, this is gonna make

625
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,561
one hell of a bedtime story
some day.

626
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,303
Can I?

627
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,653
Of course.

628
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:47,226
I don't even know
what to call her.

629
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,576
Barbara.

630
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:51,926
Oh.

631
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,103
Barbara Lee Gordon.

632
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,889
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

633
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,979
[cooing]

634
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,516
Bruce, what's wrong?

635
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,739
We won.

636
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,916
Nyssa al Ghul is
still out there.

637
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,050
And she and Bane
were right.

638
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,226
All this happened
because of me,

639
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,402
because people were
trying to hurt me

640
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,796
and the people
I care about.

641
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,017
When Bane had you...

642
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,803
I thought he was
gonna kill you, Selina,

643
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:44,805
and there was nothing
I could do.

644
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:47,112
Hey.

645
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,114
I will be here

646
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,985
whenever you need me.

647
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,772
What?

648
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:59,602
That's what my parents
used to tell me.

649
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,823
Come here.

650
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,354
That bitch stole
our submarine!

651
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,616
And our gold.

652
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,444
And by now she's probably landed

653
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,968
somewhere on the mainland,
impossible to track!

654
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,275
After all we've been through
these last months,

655
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,364
we are once again left
with nothing!

656
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,105
Nothing!

657
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,106
[grunts]

658
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,543
Back to square one.

659
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,067
Common criminals.

660
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,895
We saved this city
from certain damnation,

661
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,289
but will we see any
credit for our loyalty,

662
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,074
our selfless bravery?

663
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,075
Of course not!

664
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,815
I don't want their thanks.

665
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,817
[panting]

666
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,081
Or their respect.

667
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,474
You know what I felt,

668
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:49,304
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

669
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,049
Nothing.

670
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,400
I...

671
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:01,142
feel...

672
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,579
absolutely nothing

673
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,930
for those drab...

674
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,542
boring people.

675
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:12,153
That was me once.

676
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,548
Minimum wage
at a thankless job

677
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,723
at the GCPD.

678
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,072
"Yes, sir. No, sir.

679
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,292
Thank you so much, sir."

680
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,643
Picking up scraps
from my master's floor.

681
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,993
Shy, awkward...

682
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,952
pathetic Ed.

683
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:38,353
Common criminals?

684
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,531
Never again.

685
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:46,274
I've shown this city
who I truly am once before,

686
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,450
and I will do it again.

687
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,887
They will bow

688
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,499
to the Riddler,
and they won't get up

689
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:57,242
until I permit them to.

690
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,244
Yes.

691
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,246
You're right.

692
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,552
Our accomplishments
have been erased,

693
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:06,642
our brilliant minds
underrated.

694
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,471
If they had let me run this city
the way I wanted to,

695
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,386
it would not be in ruins now.

696
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,910
I have the men, the money,

697
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,304
the guns...Gordon took them.

698
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,741
Why? Because he still sees you

699
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,353
as Fish Mooney's umbrella boy,
and he always will.

700
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,789
Yes.

701
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:25,444
I only came back
to help him save this city

702
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,403
so that I could take it
for myself.

703
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,362
We would be stronger together.

704
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,756
No one could stop us.

705
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,368
Yeah, perhaps.

706
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:45,290
Let's make a pact,

707
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,640
here and now.

708
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,903
We will take what we want

709
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,905
from who we want,

710
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,864
and we will suffer
no fools.

711
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,477
Together.

712
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:01,349
Shall we shake
on that?

713
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,351
Please,

714
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,788
we're brothers.

715
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,138
A hug.

716
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:10,793
A hug it is.

717
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,187
[panting]

718
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,246
[sighs]

719
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,473
Life begins anew.

720
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:44,262
Shall we get to work?

721
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,314
MAN:
Thank you all
for coming here today.

722
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,883
It is my great honor
to introduce Mayor Jones.

723
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,146
[applause]

724
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,191
JONES:
With reunification underway

725
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,803
and the bridges being rebuilt,

726
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:07,981
it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon

727
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:10,592
the title of commissioner.

728
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,551
[applause]

729
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,610
[indistinct chatter]

730
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,047
We're gonna miss you
around the bullpen.

731
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,267
I won't be far.

732
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,095
And the mission doesn't change.

733
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,403
Still trying to make this city
a better place.

734
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:39,839
Be careful.

735
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,362
You're swimming with sharks now.

736
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,717
If you need anything, ever...

737
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,893
I know who to call.

738
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,858
You deserve this, Jim.

739
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,077
You really do.

740
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:03,471
I'm gonna go get
a drink before...

741
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,604
you get all teary-eyed on me.

742
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,649
[sniffles]

743
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,570
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

744
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,398
Bane's in prison, it's over.

745
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:22,490
My life here... it's too public.

746
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,797
You've made up your mind.

747
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,407
Gotham's in
good hands.

748
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:28,757
Commissioner.

749
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,368
Yeah.

750
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,373
Thank you, Bruce,

751
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,332
for everything you've done
for me and for the city.

752
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,901
Gotham will always be your home.

753
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,742
Bruce is all grown up.

754
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:59,092
That he is.Well,

755
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,094
now you have another
little one to look after.

756
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,019
Where's Bruce?

757
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,630
Um...

758
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:17,806
he left you this.

759
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,080
[shuddering]

760
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,014
BRUCE:
You know how to reach me
if you need anything?

761
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:55,453
Yes.

762
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:59,631
Well, you know me, Master Bruce,
I'll be very self-sufficient.

763
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,462
Busy, actually. You know,
we start the reconstruction

764
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:09,292
of Wayne Enterprises
and Wayne Manor tomorrow.

765
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,644
You will remember everything
I taught you, won't you?

766
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,690
Of course.

767
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:23,263
Good, that's... that's good.

768
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:27,354
I never tried to replace
your parents, you know?

769
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:30,966
I couldn't, I never would.

770
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,014
But I want you to know,
Master Bruce,

771
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,494
that you are the only son

772
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,887
that I will
ever have,

773
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,107
and I could not be more proud.

774
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,464
[shuddering]

775
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:22,104
[turbine whirring]

776
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:34,247
[airplane taking off]
