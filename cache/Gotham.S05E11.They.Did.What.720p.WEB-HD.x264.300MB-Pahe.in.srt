Nyssa al Ghul escaped.
There's no way

543
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:50,783
to order the army to stand down.

544
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,611
So, now what?

545
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,265
The army blew up
Wayne Enterprises

546
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,659
and knocked down
two other buildings.

547
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,574
We don't stand a chance.

548
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,402
Actually, that was
Bruce and Selina.

549
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,925
What?

550
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,492
The army's blocks away.

551
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,363
GORDON:
From what direction?Every direction.

552
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,364
We're surrounded.

553
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,368
Jim. I need to get her
out of here.

554
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:14,937
All right. The tunnels
underneath the GCPD.

555
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,548
There's a vent shaft, it
connects to the subway line.

556
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:21,335
Take the baby and the refugees
down into the subways.

557
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,989
Get 'em behind enemy lines.

558
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,860
Don't stop till
you get to safety.
Okay.

559
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,906
But what about you?

560
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,432
We'll hold 'em off outside,
buy you some time.

561
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,955
Jim...These refugees,

562
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,261
most of them are
from the Narrows.

563
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,697
They know you, they trust you.

564
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,874
They know you'll
protect them.

565
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,702
Go.

566
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:52,714
Oh, there you are,
Master Bruce.

567
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,195
Rest, Alfred.

568
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:59,373
All this time,
I tried to protect you.

569
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,463
There you are,
a soldier.

570
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:06,075
A soldier for good.

571
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,035
You've spent your life
protecting me.

572
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,125
Now it's time for me
to do the same.

573
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,997
It's time for me
to protect Gotham.

574
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,434
Even if there's nothing left
to defend.

575
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,099
All right, everyone,
let's move. Okay.

576
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,623
All right, you'll walk
about five blocks underground,

577
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,626
and then you'll get
to a subway vent. Go.

578
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:39,848
You're not coming with us?

579
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,590
Jim and our friends are
out there making a stand.

580
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,939
That's where I belong.

581
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,724
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

582
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,771
Survive. Make sure this
was all worth it. Go.

583
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,475
What was that for?

584
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,173
Everything you've done
for me.

585
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,001
And for her.

586
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:03,959
Just get them to safety.

587
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,248
It's over, Jim.

588
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,947
Our war's come to an end.

589
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,212
This isn't a war.
This is a firing squad.

590
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,086
I told you to go.

591
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,392
And I didn't listen.

592
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,959
Ready.

593
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:47,960
[panting]

594
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,701
Aim.

595
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,660
[rifles cocking]

596
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,404
MAN:
Shoulder to shoulder.

597
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,971
-Stand together.
-What the...?

598
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:05,804
They're here for us, Jim.

599
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,946
Fire.

600
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,687
[crowd quiets]

601
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,430
I said fire!

602
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,215
GORDON:
You have a choice.

603
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,829
You can stand with us,
or you can stand with them.

604
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,851
[crowd cheering]

605
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,910
CROWD [chanting]:
We are Gotham!

606
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,957
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

607
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,528
[coughing]

608
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:27,755
So that bitch was telling
the truth after all.

609
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,153
[dog barking]

610
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,730
LUCIUS:
We managed to raise
the mainland on the radio.

611
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,297
They know everything.
As of right now,

612
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,951
the army's being repurposed

613
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,258
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

614
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,478
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

615
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,828
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

616
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,787
I'll be damned.

617
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,702
Hey.

618
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:05,793
So...

619
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,187
this whole
"not listening" thing.

620
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,710
It's not gonna become
a habit, is it?

621
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,060
You're welcome.

622
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,200
Go.

623
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:30,296
[chuckles softly]

624
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,514
Well, this is gonna make

625
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,561
one hell of a bedtime story
some day.

626
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,303
Can I?

627
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,653
Of course.

628
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:47,226
I don't even know
what to call her.

629
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,576
Barbara.

630
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:51,926
Oh.

631
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,103
Barbara Lee Gordon.

632
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,889
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

633
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,979
[cooing]

634
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,516
Bruce, what's wrong?

635
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,739
We won.

636
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,916
Nyssa al Ghul is
still out there.

637
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,050
And she and Bane
were right.

638
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,226
All this happened
because of me,

639
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,402
because people were
trying to hurt me

640
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,796
and the people
I care about.

641
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,017
When Bane had you...

642
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,803
I thought he was
gonna kill you, Selina,

643
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:44,805
and there was nothing
I could do.

644
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:47,112
Hey.

645
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,114
I will be here

646
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,985
whenever you need me.

647
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,772
What?

648
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:59,602
That's what my parents
used to tell me.

649
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,823
Come here.

650
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,354
That bitch stole
our submarine!

651
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,616
And our gold.

652
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,444
And by now she's probably landed

653
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,968
somewhere on the mainland,
impossible to track!

654
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,275
After all we've been through
these last months,

655
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,364
we are once again left
with nothing!

656
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,105
Nothing!

657
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,106
[grunts]

658
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,543
Back to square one.

659
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,067
Common criminals.

660
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,895
We saved this city
from certain damnation,

661
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,289
but will we see any
credit for our loyalty,

662
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,074
our selfless bravery?

663
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,075
Of course not!

664
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,815
I don't want their thanks.

665
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,817
[panting]

666
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,081
Or their respect.

667
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,474
You know what I felt,

668
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:49,304
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

669
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,049
Nothing.

670
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,400
I...

671
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:01,142
feel...

672
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,579
absolutely nothing

673
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,930
for those drab...

674
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,542
boring people.

675
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:12,153
That was me once.

676
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,548
Minimum wage
at a thankless job

677
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,723
at the GCPD.

678
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,072
"Yes, sir. No, sir.

679
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,292
Thank you so much, sir."

680
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,643
Picking up scraps
from my master's floor.

681
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,993
Shy, awkward...

682
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,952
pathetic Ed.

683
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:38,353
Common criminals?

684
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,531
Never again.

685
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:46,274
I've shown this city
who I truly am once before,

686
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,450
and I will do it again.

687
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,887
They will bow

688
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,499
to the Riddler,
and they won't get up

689
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:57,242
until I permit them to.

690
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,244
Yes.

691
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,246
You're right.

692
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,552
Our accomplishments
have been erased,

693
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:06,642
our brilliant minds
underrated.

694
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,471
If they had let me run this city
the way I wanted to,

695
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,386
it would not be in ruins now.

696
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,910
I have the men, the money,

697
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,304
the guns...Gordon took them.

698
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,741
Why? Because he still sees you

699
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,353
as Fish Mooney's umbrella boy,
and he always will.

700
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,789
Yes.

701
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:25,444
I only came back
to help him save this city

702
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,403
so that I could take it
for myself.

703
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,362
We would be stronger together.

704
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,756
No one could stop us.

705
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,368
Yeah, perhaps.

706
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:45,290
Let's make a pact,

707
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,640
here and now.

708
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,903
We will take what we want

709
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,905
from who we want,

710
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,864
and we will suffer
no fools.

711
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,477
Together.

712
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:01,349
Shall we shake
on that?

713
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,351
Please,

714
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,788
we're brothers.

715
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,138
A hug.

716
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:10,793
A hug it is.

717
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,187
[panting]

718
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,246
[sighs]

719
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,473
Life begins anew.

720
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:44,262
Shall we get to work?

721
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,314
MAN:
Thank you all
for coming here today.

722
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,883
It is my great honor
to introduce Mayor Jones.

723
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,146
