Well... one can never know.
But I always hope for the best.

the same thing: to take down Escobar.

Now as a veteran of numerous conflicts,
I learned one immutable truth:

117
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,086
the only way to succeed is by
working together, communicating,

118
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:45,464
sharing intelligence and collaborating.
Understood?

119
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,803
Uh, this is Claudia Messina.
She is the new DEA country attaché.

120
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:54,098
She'll be taking over all DEA operations
in-country. Messina?

Thank you, Ambassador.

122
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,814
The DEA will be opening field offices
in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla.

123
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,316
As far as the Medellín team
is concerned,

124
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,195
they will be housed out of
CNP headquarters until further notice.

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,948
But only after some personnel changes
have been made.

126
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:13,742
Now as far as
long-term intelligence is concerned,

127
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:17,704
that's under the purview of the CIA,
the station chief, Bill Stechner.

128
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,249
- Bill, anything you'd like to add?
- I'm good.

129
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,836
(Low chuckle)

130
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,965
- Who's here from Centra Spike?
- I am, sir. Edward Jacoby.

131
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,342
Let's get Centra Spike
in the air immediately.

132
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,511
I wanna know every word
these assholes say.

133
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:35,389
All information flows through me
and I'll disseminate it.

134
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,598
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,101
When Escobar
sticks his fucking head out,

136
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,311
we're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

137
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:45,190
(Messina) What about him?
Other than the fact he wasn'<i>t</i> here today.

138
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:47,484
Well, I suggested that he stay home.

139
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:51,738
You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

140
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,532
It means I'm making some changes.

141
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:55,909
Murphy's a good agent.
He's done a lot down here.

142
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,452
Yeah.

143
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:01,081
Looks like it.

144
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:08,130
Do you have any idea
the strings that were pulled

145
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,965
to get that guy not to press charges?

146
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,342
The guy would've had
a dog sniffing up his ass

147
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,220
before he got on the plane.
Maybe Steve did him a favour.

148
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,597
Was that a thank you?

149
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,144
Be straight with me
and I'll be straight with you.

150
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,980
I don'<i>t</i> need a guy like that
making my life more difficult.

151
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:27,065
- And making the DEA look bad.
- Ma'am...

152
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:30,235
Messina. Or boss.

153
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,904
We've been down here a long time.

154
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,531
You've been down here all of what,
<i>two</i> hours?

155
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,287
It may not make the front page, <i>but...</i>

156
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:43,248
a lot of the intel we have
is because of Steve.

157
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,711
He's a good man.
He's going through some shit right now.

158
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:48,921
He was at the airport

159
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:53,175
to stop his wife from leaving the country
with their kid. He didn'<i>t</i> make it.

160
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,762
Add that to watching Escobar
build a five-star prison

161
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,722
and walking out the back door.

162
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,685
We both deserve to see this through...

163
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,188
boss.

164
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:15,113
(Steve sniffs, clears throat)

165
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:20,535
Have you, uh... had anything to eat
in the last 24 hours?

166
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:24,206
This new boss... Messina...

167
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:26,959
What do you know about her?

168
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,878
Only what I've heard.
She's out of New York.

169
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,966
- Doesn'<i>t</i> put up with any shit.
- (Steve sputters)

170
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:37,135
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

171
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:38,929
Am I out?

172
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,431
I don'<i>t</i> know.

173
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:47,562
Well, I ain'<i>t</i> ready to go home yet, Javi.
I'll tell you that.

174
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:50,941
- Damn it! She's fucking...
- (Bottle top clatters)

175
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:56,029
- Take a shower. Sober up.
- (Sighs)

176
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,364
Talk to you.

177
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,415
(Pablo speaks Spanish)
Behind you. Watch out for that guy.

178
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,417
(Video game noises)

179
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,168
That's it.

180
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,878
Smash the telephone booth.

181
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,256
Get the pipe.

182
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,216
I already know, Dad.

183
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,176
You have to get it.

184
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,680
And what's that, a woman?

185
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,849
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

186
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,102
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

187
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:28,645
Nora.

188
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,732
(Velasco) Boss, excuse the interruption.

189
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,192
How do you...?

190
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,578
What about the laboratories?

191
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:48,415
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

192
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,376
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

193
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:54,421
There are police checkpoints
everywhere.

194
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:57,424
We lost four men
trying to get through one.

195
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,761
Bastards.

196
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,181
And what about Judy Moncada?

197
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,436
We can't find her anywhere.
Or Don Berna.

198
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:10,979
Find her.

199
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,148
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,528
And you, boys?

201
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,656
- Everything is good, boss.
- All good, boss.

202
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:24,034
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

203
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,911
- How are you feeling?
- Very good.

204
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,746
- Comfortable?
- Thanks. Very good.

205
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,039
Good.

206
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,250
I'm going to teach you something.

207
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:37,255
There is nothing lower than a rat.

208
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:45,055
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

209
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,140
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

210
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,061
Give me one second. One second.

211
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,021
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

212
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:55,941
Tell me, Fernando.

213
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,610
'Your interview clearly worked,
Don Pablo.

214
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,238
'Palace wants to meet with me
right away.'

215
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,990
You heard that, brother? Hmm?

216
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:09,204
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

217
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,499
No, brother, there's still one left.

218
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:14,835
But you already killed all the whores.

219
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,462
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

220
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,841
Why her?

221
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,219
- She did everything we told her <i>to.</i>
- Someone talked to the police.

222
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,763
Yeah, it was those fucking whores.

223
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:30,183
- She is someone we can trust, man.
- (La Quica snorts)

224
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,603
You can trust her, but I can'<i>t.</i>

225
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,105
Move it.

226
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:38,942
Quica.

227
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:45,449
I'm not telling you again, brother.
And we've got some shit to do.

228
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,492
- (Fernando) Good day.
- (Man) Good day.

229
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,121
I have a meeting with the president.

230
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:52,789
I'm Fernando Duque.

231
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,255
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr Duque.

232
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,590
How's that?

233
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:06,970
- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

234
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:10,682
The information I have here says
you are meeting the attorney general.

235
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:15,187
My apologies, Mr Duque.

236
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,192
(Steve)
'Now, Gaviria had made it clear

237
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:23,403
'that the government
was not to negotiate with Escobar.

238
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:25,906
'But Colombia Attorney General
Gustavo de Greiff

239
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,658
'didn'<i>t</i> give a shit
what the president wanted.

240
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:34,789
'Unlike the US, where the attorney
general is appointed by the president,

241
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,793
'in Colombia, the Supreme Court
chooses the attorney general,

242
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,338
'whether the president likes it or not.

243
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:47,552
'And in the case of Gustavo de Greiff,
you bet your ass Gaviria didn'<i>t.'</i>

244
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:50,138
(In Spanish) Mr Duque...

245
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:55,727
I believe everybody
has the right to a fair trial.

246
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,192
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

247
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,323
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

248
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:11,368
He can'<i>t</i> be hunted and killed
like an animal.

249
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,704
Mr De Greiff,

250
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,835
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

251
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,881
However, I don'<i>t...</i>

252
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:29,219
I don'<i>t</i> buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

253
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:33,181
like Gaviria, Mr Duque.

254
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,225
(Fernando) Uh-huh.

255
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,602
Then that means <i>that...</i>

256
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:43,024
you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

257
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,987
I'm saying that Colombia...

258
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,574
has been at war far too long.

259
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:52,617
Of course.

260
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,002
The Americans are bringing in
new people.

261
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:06,631
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

262
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:11,761
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

263
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:13,805
Perhaps.

264
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:18,226
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

265
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:22,355
The thing about the gringos
is they are limited

266
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,524
to Carlos Holguín
and the embassy.

267
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:29,321
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground and support.

268
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:31,573
Everyone is helping him in Medellín.

269
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:35,243
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellín.

270
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,544
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

271
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,757
Do you think we'll succeed?

272
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:53,136
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music plays on radio)

273
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,641
Listen, thanks for talking
to Messina, man.

274
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,810
I mean it. You saved my ass.

275

One more fuck-up, Murphy...

276
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,486
Oh, I know.

277
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,530
Is it gonna happen again?

278
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:16,451
I don'<i>t</i> know.

the only thing we had to navigate.

Fuck me.

314
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,173
(Man shouts in Spanish) Faggots!

315
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:36,966
(Men laughing)

316
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,054
(Steve) 'Our inability to catch Escobar
was frustrating.

317
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,557
'But back in Bogotá,
it was becoming a real liability.'

318
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:52,065
(In Spanish)
Mr De Greiff.

319
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,735
They told me that you met
with Mr Fernando Duque.

320
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:57,529
That's right.

321
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,240
The president was very clear

322
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:04,410
when he said that no one was
to communicate with Escobar's people.

323
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:08,665
Unfortunately for the president,
I don'<i>t</i> work for him.

324
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,752
I work for the people of Colombia.

325
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:17,173
And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

326
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:20,426
And we should be working
in a united front against Escobar.

327
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:23,471
- Not in a war...
- Are you afraid of what I might find

328
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:26,266
if I speak with him, Mr Sandoval?

329
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:29,602
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

330
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:33,064
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

331
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:38,444
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

332
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,904
to transfer a prisoner?

333
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,953
(Sighs) Because we're not talking about
any prisoner.

334
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,289
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

335
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:52,125
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

336
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,335
I don'<i>t</i> think that's true.

337
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,257
Are you insinuating something, sir?

338
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:03,928
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

339
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:06,180
At least, not yet.

340
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:12,604
But I'm going to open up an
investigation about the allegations...

341
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:18,651
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

342
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,697
You know what, Attorney General?

343
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:26,367
Eat shit.

344
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,332
(Door closes)

345
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,502
- (Limón) What are we doing here?
- (La Quica) Running an errand.

346
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:39,964
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

347
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:42,967
Hello, hello.

348
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:45,303
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you?

349
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:49,515
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

350
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,726
Yes, sir.
Right away, with pleasure.

351
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:53,144
Go ahead.

352
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:59,317
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back. Hmm?

353
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:02,403
Are you afraid or what, Limón? Huh?

354
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:08,952
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

355
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:23,132
- (Man) Mr Alvarez.
- (Clears throat, coughs)

356
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:24,592
Quica!

357
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:27,762
(Man) Best one in the market.
You really know your shit.

358
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,055
Brother!

359
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,641
That's great, brother.

360
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,142
Good.

361
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:37,063
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got stuff to do.

362
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:42,652
I'm going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

363
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:54,163
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

364
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:57,375
(Buzzing)

365
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,806
Bastard. You told me
she'd be here.

366
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:15,184
(Limón) I don'<i>t</i> know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

367
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,811
(Bangs door)

368
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:18,646
(Buzzing)

369
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,566
She's not there.
Tomorrow is better.

370
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:23,359
Or we'll come back later.

371
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,237
Fuck that, brother.

372
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:31,117
Quica!

373
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:41,961
Over there, brother.

374
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,882
(Objects clattering)

375
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,687
(La Quica)
I got something.

376
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:16,120
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

377
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:20,666
I told you she wasn'<i>t</i> here.
At this hour, she's already working.

378
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:23,086
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

379
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,171
(La Quica)
We'll come back later, then.

380
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:27,173
(Retreating footsteps)

381
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:31,427
If the president
refuses to negotiate,

382
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,055
then we haven'<i>t</i> won anything.
Right?

383
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:40,645
Pablo, we have found
a very good option.

384
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,188
Definitely.

385
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:48,027
If you let me negotiate with De Greiff,
create some dissension in his ranks...

386
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,403
Oh, Fernando.

387
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,739
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

388
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:55,993
You pay me to strategise
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

389
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,664
Pablo, you have to understand...

390
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:05,336
The moment... The position
that Gaviria is in right now...

391
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:11,050
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

392
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:16,722
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

393
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,226
And he's not thinking about

394
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:26,065
trying to find some way
to speak with us, <i>but...</i>

395
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,822
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

396
00:27:33,948 --> 00:27:36,909
And he has the autonomy
to make deals.

397
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,501
Fine, OK.

398
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:47,753
Let's try <i>it.</i>

399
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,842
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

400
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,052
supports the legalisation of drugs.

401
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:57,346
- Don'<i>t</i> bullshit me.
- It's true.

402
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:04,103
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time...

403
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:06,439
What we don'<i>t</i> have is time, Fernando.

404
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,737
Fernando, excuse us.

405
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:14,655
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

406
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,115
- Blackie.
- Sir.

407
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,285
Thank you very much, Fernando.

408
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,829
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

409
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,748
Excuse me.

410
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:35,843
What's wrong?

411
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,181
We can'<i>t</i> live like this, Pablo.

412
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,768
Running from one place to another,
hiding,

413
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,937
hoping the government
wants to negotiate.

414
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:48,189
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

415
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:53,569
He's too intelligent and too weak not <i>to.</i>

416
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,199
How are you so calm, huh?

417
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:04,789
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn'<i>t want</i> you in jail
then we know what he wants.

418
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,797
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

419
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:17,885
I know we said we would never leave,
but things have changed.

420
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,887
No, nothing has changed.

421
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,401
My love, we have everything
we need.

422
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:36,445
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

423
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:39,865
A place where we don'<i>t</i> have to hide.

424
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,954
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

425
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,628
I promise you that.

426
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,897
Get ready to get your balls snipped.

427
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:19,280
So... your wife left.

428
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:23,743
You're upset,
knocked a few back to numb the pain

429
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:27,496
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

430
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,666
Yeah, something like <i>that.</i>

431
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,337
Isolated incident?

432
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:36,797
Yeah.

433
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:43,137
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

434
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:44,680
Mmh.

435
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,641
Before that,

436
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,853
you and Peña had complete autonomy
to call your own shots.

437
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:54,315
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

438
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,567
You don'<i>t</i> trust me yet? That's fine.

439
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,279
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know I can trust you.

440
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:03,574
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

441
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,702
Am I making myself clear?

442
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:08,579
Loud and clear.

443
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:10,122
Excellent.

444
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,875
You're dismissed.

445
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,093
(Sighs)

446
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:32,019
(Sighing)

447
00:31:32,144 --> 00:31:35,731
(In Spanish) Ortiz, don'<i>t</i> let him
out of your sight. Over.

448
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,193
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

449
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:42,947
(In English)
I got "La Quica" and "toilet."

450
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,116
(In Spanish)
Guess which one he bought.

451
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:48,369
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

452
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:50,830
(In English)
All right, now, that I got.

453
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:54,375
We can'<i>t</i> take that to Pinzón.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

454
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,168
(In Spanish)
We need more.

455
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:59,463
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

456
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,757
Going toward the hills
on San Isidro Avenue.

457
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:07,513
(In English) Maybe we can
get Centra Spike to do a flyover.

458
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:09,807
Be a lot better than the fucking tip line.

459
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,893
I'll be right back.

460
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,146
(Chatter in Spanish over radio)

461
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,566
- A toilet?
- It's a long story.

462
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,652
- Give me the CliffsNotes.
- Just do me a favour

463
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:24,655
and ask them to sweep over
that specific area.

464
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,284
We're looking for any chatter from
Escobar's <i>sicarios.</i> Anything at all.

465
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:32,079
You recognise a voice,
you come get me.

466
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,498
(Over radio) 'Duvall 1 -4-4-3-6,

467
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:38,002
'we've heard some chatter
at 1600 megahertz. Be advised.'

468
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,380
(Woman, in Spanish) 'Baby,
when are you coming? I'm all alone.'

469
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:43,924
(Velasco) 'I can'<i>t</i> right now.
It's too dangerous.'

470
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,093
(Woman) 'But you said
you were coming.'

471
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:50,306
(Velasco) 'Let things calm down
a little bit. I'll show you a good time.'

472
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:54,226
That is definitely Velasco.
No ID on the girl.

473
00:32:55,102 --> 00:32:56,896
What's the deal with the other call?

474
00:32:57,897 --> 00:32:59,773
(Garbled radio chatter)

475
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,611
The quality's too poor
for voice recognition.

476
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:11,702
(Steve sighs) All right...
these were taken about two hours ago.

477
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,247
What's here is <i>fincas, fincas.</i>

478
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:18,751
Everything else is smaller houses
here and here, and the outskirts.

479
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:22,379
You can probably eliminate
the smaller ones, not Escobar's style.

480
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,634
Which of the fincas have road access
both east and west?

481
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,011
(Javier) This one here.

482
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,889
Rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but drivable.

483
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:33,057
It's gotta be the one.

484
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,601
We'd have a chance
if we came at him from both sides.

485
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:36,769
(Messina) Good.

486
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:38,646
Great. What about Pinzón?

487
00:33:39,605 --> 00:33:42,191
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

488
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:44,818
Leave Pinzón to me.

489
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:49,073
(In Spanish)
Correct me if I'm wrong...

490
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:54,411
In the last raid,
your <i>two</i> men managed to capture

491
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:58,832
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

492
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,459
(Messina chuckles)

493
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:03,837
(In Spanish) That was based on
several calls from the tip line.

494
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:08,342
This is the voice of Velasco.

495
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:12,638
Ms Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

496
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:16,058
You are mistaken.
I don'<i>t</i> work for you.

497
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:19,562
I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

498
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:24,024
And I know what happened
to the last man that worked with you,

499
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,818
Colonel Carrillo.

500
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:28,320
He was exiled to Spain.

501
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:35,327
What did he say?

502
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,162
He said no.

503
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,753
Oh, she's not gonna last.
She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

504
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,424
(Steve)
'But Messina didn'<i>t</i> give up easy.

505
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:49,842
'She called Crosby...

506

508
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,473
I understand.

509
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,517
'Pinzón was getting' a kick in the ass.'

510
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:01,937
(In Spanish)
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

511
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:03,606
Excuse me, Colonel.

512
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,404
(Steve)
'I guess everybody works for somebody.'

513
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,782
General?

514
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,244

make Pinzón dance

He liked kicking down the front door,

the whole damn neighbourhood.'

519

They're coming from
the other side too, sir.
