00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:05,018
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out
every one.

185
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,847
She's still out there.
I know it.

186
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,249
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

187
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,860
They run a group home.

188
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,037
I can take care of myself.

189
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,908
When you're 18.

190
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,650
Until then, I won't have you
living on the streets,

191
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,695
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

192
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,264
Give these people
a chance.

193
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,832
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

194
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,486
You're out of options.

195
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,622
[car door opens]

196
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,715
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

197
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,587
Just know that
me and Rosa,
we get it.

198
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,154
We were foster kids
back in the day.

199
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,720
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

200
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,332
Girl, I'm young at heart.

201
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,855
I got my finger
on the pulse.

202
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,552
Yeah, that's a reference

203
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,902
-to his blood pressure
because he's old.
-[laughs]

204
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,381
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

205
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,209
[Victor] Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

206
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,863
-[Rosa speaks Spanish]
-What?

207
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,041
[Rosa in English] We know
how overwhelming
it can all be.

208
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,869
New house, new faces.

209
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,566
[Victor] All up in your face.

210
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,178
Just take it
at your own speed.

211
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,968
[music playing]

212
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,232
Hello?

213
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:34,934
We're home.

214
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,023
That's what happens
when you suck!

215
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:39,895
So much
for the welcome party.

216
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,028
[sighs] Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

217
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,464
would be Eugene.

218
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:44,900
Is that him?

219
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,902
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

220
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,164
[Victor] Whoa!
Slow down, slow down.

221
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,513
[Darla] Welcome home!

222
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,385
-[Rosa] And that's Darla.
-I'm Darla.

223
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:52,299
Big hugger.

224
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,735
I noticed.

225
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:56,085
Die, die, die!

226
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,782
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

227
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,569
Hey.

228
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,875
No sodas after dark,
remember?

229
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,834
Whoa. When did it get dark?

230
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,836
Oh, the poster.
I made you one.

231
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:11,187
Come look! Oh, no!

232
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,929
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

233
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,670
His goal is to get swole.

234
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,498
[Eugene] Just one hit!
Just one hit!

235
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:18,629
Oh...

236
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,154
Here.

237
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,722
Yes, exactly why your math
department is so uniquely
suited for me.

238
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,376
[Eugene] Shut up! No!

239
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,639
I can't even
with Eugene right now.

240
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,338
I'm sorry. Mary, hi.
College interview.

241
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,513
I'm Billy.

242
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,210
What am I
most excited about?

243
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:37,518
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

244
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,346
[mouthing] What am I most
excited about?

245
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,043
[mouthing]

246
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,306
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

247
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:46,744
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

248
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,226
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer in finding
family and friends

249
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,533
in the most unlikely
of places.

250
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,625
I'm gonna miss that girl
so much.

251
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,801
It's Caltech.
It's a very
prestigious school.

252
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,411
And also all the way
in California.

253
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,848
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

254
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,241
It's a tough subject
for me.

255
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,634
Do you like vegan food?

256
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,897
-Mmm-mmm.
-Because, see, I love animals.

257
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,681
[fire alarm beeping]

258
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,596
-[Rosa gasps]
-Oh, no! The Tofurky!

259
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,381
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

260
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,556
-Is that...
-It's okay.

261
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,514
Come, I'll show you
your room.

262
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,865
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

263
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,520
[Eugene] Time to dance
on your grave!

264
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,174
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

265
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,307
[speaking Spanish]

266
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,047
-[music playing
over earphones]
-[in English] Say hi to Billy.

267
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,747
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

268
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,795
Freddy.

269
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,755
This is Billy Batson.

270
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,322
Make sure you make him
feel at home.

271
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,584
-Okay?
-Yeah.

272
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,542
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

273
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,631
Oh, one weird thing is,

274
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,545
did you know that Romans
used to brush their teeth
with their urine?

275
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,332
And apparently, it works.

276
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,421
Yep. Um...

277
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,997
Oh, it's a long way down.

278
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,217
Trust me, I speak
from experience.

279
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,267
Victor pushed me.

280
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,444
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

281
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,359
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

282
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:22,449
What?

283
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,711
[snickers]

284
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,627
Dude, I'm just
messin' around.

285
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:30,152
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

286
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,287
Kidding, again!
You look at me,
and you're like,

287
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,767
"Why so dark?
You're a disabled foster kid.
You've got it all."

288
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,899
Right? [chuckles]

289
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:42,773
Oh, yeah,
that's the old Batarang.

290
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,559
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

291
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,126
I could kill you
in your sleep
with that thing.

292
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,651
You more of a Supes guy?

293
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:54,524
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

294
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,092
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

295
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,007
It's legit.

296
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,444
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

297
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:02,445
What's in the bag?

298
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,969
Hey.

299
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,407
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to
maintain boundaries.

300
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:11,237
[sighs] You don't gotta talk
so much, you know.

301
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,761
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

302
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,700
[Victor] Dinner!

303
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,752
All hands on deck.

304
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,539
[Rosa speaks Spanish]

305
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,757
-[chuckles]
-[Victor] Thank you
for this family.

306
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,542
Thank you for this day.

307
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,023
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

308
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,111
[Darla laughs]

309
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,073
Big school.
2,000 students,
you might think,

310
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,901
"Wow, so many strangers."

311
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:09,338
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

312
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,906
Then it's,
"Wow, so many friends."

313
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,909
The principal,
her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

314
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,824
-Next.
-[metal detector beeping]

315
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,478
This is
our security scanner.

316
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,915
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

317
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,091
I know what it is.

318
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,136
-Does she always do this?
-Mmm-hmm.

319
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,487
Silence makes me
uncomfortable.

320
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:30,011
She's almost never
uncomfortable.

321
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,971
Have a good first day,
big brother.

322
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,147
Look, you don't have to
hug me all the time.

323
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,367
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

324
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,283
[Darla] I'm sorry.

325
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,202
-Hey.
-Hey.

326
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,682
[stammers] I didn't mean
to make her...

327
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,470
[Ms. Kwan on TV] 
I was overwhelmed, honestly.

328
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:59,258
 He said 
I must be pure of heart.

329
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,912
 He call himself a wizard.

330
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:07,570
 He even dressed like a wizard 
fromHarry Potter or some...

331
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,834
 But you're saying that 
other people 
have experienced this?

332
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:15,056
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember
what he said to you?

333
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,710
 He tested me.

334
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:20,583
 There were these statues.

335
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,413
 Their eyes, it's like they 
were looking at me, 
making me think things.

336
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,241
 Horrible things.

337
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,287
And do these approximate
what you saw?

338
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:33,901
 Yes, that's exactly 
how I remember it.

339
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,033
 I don't understand. 
How do you know...

340
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,994
Recurrent imagery has proven
very common in cases
of mass hysteria.

341
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,343
 Mass hysteria?

342
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,998
I know. The term's
a bit theatrical.

343
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,827
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

344
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,438
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

345
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,311
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other--

346
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,747
[man] The symbols.

347
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,797
Ask her about the symbols.

348
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:04,975
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.
But as an example
of recurrent imagery,

349
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,934
maybe you'll recall seeing

350
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,546
these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

351
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,375
 I don't remember 
any symbols, no.

352
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:17,161
 I think I got it on video. 
There was something, um...

353
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,207
 I remember the numbers 
on my alarm clock.

354
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:20,556
 They kept shifting.

355
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:21,601
Video?

356
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,909
Show me the video.

357
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,695
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

358
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,872
 -Um, one moment, 
I can send it.
-[keyboard clacks]

359
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:35,310
-[rumbling]
-[Ms. Kwan on video] 
Hello? Oh, my God!

360
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,443
 Who's there?

361
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,402
 Hello? What's going on? 
What's happening?

362
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:45,712
[stammers] I'm going to call 
the police!

363
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,323
 Then this blinding light 
all around me

364
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,673
 and I felt like I was getting 
pulled down into something.

365
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,676
 It felt like a temple 
carved inside a mountain.

366
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:56,505
 He looked exactly what you'd 
expect from a guy who 
calls himself a wizard.

367
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,725
 ...and how you were 
brought there to 
save the world.

368
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,727
-[man] Wearing a cape. 
-And there's no ceiling.

369
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,989
[scientist] We ran
the numbers again...

370
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,078
Dr. Sivana!

371
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:09,039
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

372
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:12,129
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

373
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,305
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

374
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,698
-I never saw it.
-Saw what?

375
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,368
Doctor, what is all this?

376
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,371
All these years...

377
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,377
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

378
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,381
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

379
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,035
to open the door.

380
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,169
But on that woman's
alarm clock,

381
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,606
the seven symbols.

382
00:23:55,695 --> 00:24:00,569
The sequence
repeated itself seven times.

383
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,355
That's the difference.

384
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,445
Is this
some sort of joke?

385
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:08,447
It may seem that way to you

386
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:12,668
because we're not in actuality
studying mass hysteria.

387
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,541
What all these people
have seen,

388
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,066
every single one of them,
is absolutely real.

389
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:22,199
[scoffs] An alarm clock
malfunctions

390
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:25,376
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

391
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,509
-Hmm.
-Come on, Dr. Sivana.

392
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,946
You can't believe
any of this is real.

393
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:33,863
[Dr. Lynn gasps]

394
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,651
[groaning]

395
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,348
[screaming]

396
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:43,786
Why, yes.

397
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,664
Yes, I do.

398
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,460
[exhales sharply]

399
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,129
-[footsteps approaching]
-[labored breathing]

400
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,307
[wizard groaning]

401
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:34,794
I've been waiting
for this moment
for so long...

402
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,537
and now here we are.

403
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,364
You don't remember me,
do you?

404
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,938
I remember you.

405
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,072
You were a boy.

406
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,509
And now you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

407
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,426
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told
you'll never be good enough?

408
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,733
No, you don't.

409
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,780
What you said to me
all those years ago made me
realize who I really was.

410
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,390
And you know something?

411
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,219
[voices whispering]

412
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,918
I am not pure of heart.

413
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:16,487
[Wrath] The wizard
is too weak to stop us.

414
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:20,056
No!

415
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,318
No!

416
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:28,630
[rumbling]

417
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,069
[Wrath] You never found
your champion.

418
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,508
But we found ours.

419
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,206
[grunting]

420
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,817
[Wrath growls]

421
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,427
[groaning]

422
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:56,571
[Wrath] You are
the true champion.

423
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,109
[panting]

424
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,071
[breathing heavily]

425
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,648
[wizard] They're using you.

426
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:32,607
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

427
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:33,652
[grunts]

428
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:42,835
Through you, they'll spread
their poison to everything
they touch!

429
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:46,186
Make mankind
turn on each other!

430
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:48,623
[Dr. Sivana] You seek
a pure soul, old man,

431
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,843
but no one's worthy.

432
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,628
[groans]

433
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:55,674
[panting]

434
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,593
-[students chattering]
-Flight or invisibility?

435
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,292
If you could have
one superpower,

436
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,337
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

437
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:10,036
I mean,
everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

438
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,951
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

439
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,822
No, no.
'Cause heroes fly.

440
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,781
And who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

441
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,000
But invisibility, no way.
[scoffs]

442
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,872
That's pervy.

443
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,961
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

444
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,702
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power,
right?

445
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:24,703
[chattering stops]

446
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,057
[scoffs]

447
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,841
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

448
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,147
They asked people
the same question.

449
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,018
You know, what power
do you want?

450
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,193
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

451
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,804
And most people,
since they knew

452
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:40,414
that it was secret,
said invisibility.

453
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,981
And I think that's 'cause
most people

454
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,374
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

455
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,507
You're gonna run away.

456
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,944
I mean, you stole
my Superman bullet.

457
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,033
Dude, I get it.
I get it.

458
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,556
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

459
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,733
You don't trust anyone.

460
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,346
That's the thing
about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

461
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,827
[scoffs] I didn't steal
your dumb bullet.

462
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,700
[door closes]

Hey. How was it today?

465
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,706
That good, huh?

466
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,404
[tires screeching]

00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,190
-Whoa!
-[groans]

468
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,887
Oh, my God! Freddy.

469
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,062
Are you okay?

470
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,368
-You okay?
-[Freddy] Yes. Yes.

471
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,763
What the hell?

472
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,286
-What is wrong with you two?
-[Burke] Oh, ho!

473
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,983
-[groans]
-No way that's
gonna buff out.

474
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,419
[Brett] You gonna pay
for that, Freeman?

475
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:30,986
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

476
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,161
Yeah, sure. Um...

477
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,467

Don't touch my brother!

00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,999
What, do you need
your fake family
to stand up for you?

484
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,435
-Stand up for yourself,
Freeman.
-[Burke] Yeah, huh?

485
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,046
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

486
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,612
Stand up for yourself.

487
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,049
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

488
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,486

Man, sorry about that.

but then again
you don't fight fair, so...

[Brett] Hey, let's go
through the back.

-[Burke] No, no, no.
-[laughing]

512
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,365
You're dead, kid.

513
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:46,975
Yeah, you think
you're funny.

514
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,585
We know
where you go to school,
buddy!

[woman on PA] Next stop, 
30th Street Station.

00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,521
-[train passes by]
-[gasps]

530
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,176
[echoing] What the hell?

531
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,830
Who's doing this?

532
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:11,554
[clears throat]

533
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,125
Hi. Um...

534
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,693
I was supposed to get off
at 30th.

535
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,477
Billy Batson.

536
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,305
How'd you know my name?

537
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:27,440
I am the last of
the Council of Wizards.

538
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,833
Keeper of
the Rock of Eternity.

539
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,444
Oh...

540
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
You're...

541
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,535
that guy.

542
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,363
Hey, listen, I don't have
any money.

543
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,408
Do not patronize me, boy.

544
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,281
[gasps]

545
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,458
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

546
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:50,637
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones
of seven wizards.

547
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:54,206
But long ago,
we chose a champion

548
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,034
and we chose recklessly.

549
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:02,649
He used his power for revenge,

550
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:06,696
releasing
the Seven Deadly Sins
into your world.

551
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,222
[people screaming]

552
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,094
Millions of lives were lost.

553
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:17,490
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

554
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:25,324
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

555
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:29,589
until I find
one truly good person.

556
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,635
Strong in spirit,

557
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:35,290
pure in heart.

558
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:38,380
Look, man,
maybe this is magic

559
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,427
and, I don't know,

560
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:44,560
but the people
you're looking for,
good, pure people,

561
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,823
I'm not one of them.

562
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,782
I don't know
if anyone is, really.

563
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,264
You, Billy Batson,

564
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,701
are all I have.

565
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:57,530
All the world has.

566
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:58,966
[bangs staff]

567
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,316
Lay your hands on my staff.

568
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,101
Gross.

569
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,147
And say my name
so my powers may
flow through you.

570
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:09,759
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

571
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:13,937
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

572
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,678
-Thanks.
-[bangs staff]

573
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,246
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

574
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,858
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

575
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:25,253
Their thrones lie empty.

576
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,038
My magic
must be passed on.

577
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,390
-Now, speak my name!
-[bangs staff]

578
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:34,567
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

579
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,699
My name is...

580
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,049
Shazam.

581
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,357
[laughs] Wait, for real?

582
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,054
-Say it!
-Okay!

583
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,795
Jeez.

584
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,939
So just say it? Like...

585
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,071
Shazam?

586
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,813
Yes!

587
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,686
Carry my name, and with it,
you carry all my powers.

588
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:09,558
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

589
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,953
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

590
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,609
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

591
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,010
[gasping]

592
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,099
What happened to me?
Why am...

593
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,189
[stammers] What did you do
to me? What did you do
to my voice?

594
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,888
You have been transformed
to your full potential,
Billy Batson.

595
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:40,459
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

596
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,722
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await.

597
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,121
[gasping]

598
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,997
Get me outta here!

599
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,827
[man] Dope!

600
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:02,481
[laughing]

601
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:05,397
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

602
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:08,226
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape.

603
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:11,620
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

604
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:12,752
[continues laughing]

605
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:13,753
Ow!

606
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:17,974
[train horn blares]

607
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,237
[indistinct chatter]

608
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,022
Hey!

609
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:25,939
[woman] Hey, babe!

610
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,642
[Rosa] Yes, Officer.

611
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:35,165
I'm aware he's run away
in the past.

612
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,430
Twenty-three times?

613
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,955
Guy's got
no social media presence.
At all.

614
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,130
The guy is a ghost.

615
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,274
[sighs]

616
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,677
You know, guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

617
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,113
More than happy.

618
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,419
But no, you gotta wash
the dishes.

619
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,073
That's what's
more important.

620
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,292
"What are you gonna do,
Freddy, run after him?"

621
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:17,207
[laughs mockingly] Very funny.

622
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,209
-[Freddy screaming]
-No, I said, don't scream.

623
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,776
-Uh... Victor? Victor!
-No, no!

624
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,212
-Victor!
-It's me. It's Billy.

625
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,258
It's Billy!

626
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,347
You asked me flight
or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

627
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,002
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

628
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,004
Meet me back here
after lights-out?

629
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,353
[footsteps approaching]

630
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,181
[Victor] 'Sup, bud?
You all right?

631
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:37,619
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

632
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:41,057
I'm really sad
because Billy's gone.

633
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:44,757
And, you know,
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

634
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:46,585
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

635
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,805
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son,
all right?

636
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,807
We'll find him, 'kay?

637
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,766
You don't snore that bad.

638
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,550
[sniffs] But you kinda smell.

639
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,036
[Shazam groans]

640
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,258
[exclaiming] Oh, thank God!

641
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,522
Hey. Stop right there.

642
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,872
How do I know you're not
a supervillain
using telepathic abilities

643
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,743
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

644
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,310
What?

645
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:17,790
All I have to do
is press "dial" on this thing.

646
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,095
No! No, I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

647
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:20,662
[grumbles]

648
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,795
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

649
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:25,101
-Oh, no! No, no, no.
-No!

650
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,277
[grunts in frustration]
Stupid adult hands.

651
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,192
But you saw it.

652
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:32,282
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy,
I swear. It's me, okay?

653
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,197
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

654
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,851
but you're the only person
that I know

655
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,244
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

656
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:39,115
-That's Batman.
-What?

657
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,770
Forget it.

658
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:43,772
Can I...

659
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:46,862
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

660
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,259
[Freddy exclaiming in awe]

661
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,348
[both laughing]

662
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:57,395
Oh... Oh, my God!

663
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,572
It's crazy, right?

664
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,617
What are your superpowers?

665
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:05,098
Superpowers?
Dude, I don't even know
how to pee in this thing.

666
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:06,665
Okay. Can you fly?

667
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:09,885
[Shazam] Okay!

668
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:11,670
Let's do this.

669
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:13,411
How do we do this?

670
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:16,022
Just, um, like, Superman it.

671
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,240
[imitates takeoff]

672
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,721
[weakly imitates takeoff]

673
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,114
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

674
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,550
Come on.

675
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,160
How is any of this obvious?

676
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,858
Okay.

677
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,774
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

678
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,253
I read this deep dive

679
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,820
into peer-reviewed studies
about superpowers

680
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:34,867
and in six out of ten,
belief is the key.

681
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:37,391
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay.
Okay. I believe I can fly.

682
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,262
-I believe I...
-[cell phone beeps]

683
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:40,960
I believe I can fly.
[chuckles]

684
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,222
I believe...

685
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:49,272
Whoa! [groaning]

686
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,101
-Did you believe?
-[groans]

687
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:56,541
Yeah.

688
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,977
You wanna try invisibility?

689
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,719
How do I do...

690
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,372
Forget it. You know, okay.

691
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,113
-Okay, okay, okay.
-[cell phone beeps]

692
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,728
Oh, my God! It worked!

693
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:10,772
Where'd you go?

694
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,340
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

695
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,733
Where?

696
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,996
[laughing] I'm invisible!

697
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,693
I'm right here. Over here.

698
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,608
[continues laughing]

699
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,610
I'm invisible!
I'm invisible!

700
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:23,655
[man] Hey!

701
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,483
Nice outfit, dipshit.

702
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,354
-[snickers]
-[all laughing]

703
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,487
[Freddy] I might've been
testing invisibility

704
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,532
and super-intelligence
at the same time.

705
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,230
Freeman, I'm gonna
come over there
and beat you.

706
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:35,449
[Freddy gasping]

707

-[car alarms blaring]
-[dogs barking]

708
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,936
[Freddy laughs] Oh, my God!
The lightning emblem!

709
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,329
It was staring us
right in the face
the whole time.

710
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,071
Literally!

711
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:50,682
-[laughing]
-[Shazam exclaims]

712
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,775
[both laughing]

713
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:57,819
Okay, okay.

714
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,517
Clearly, we gotta give you

715
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,997
-a lightning-themed
superhero name.
-Yeah.

716
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,260
-[both continue laughing]
-[screaming]

717
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,526
[woman grunting]

718
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:13,095
Oh, right.

719
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:14,053
Hey, yo! Back...

720
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,578
off.

721
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:21,234
[Freddy] Hyper-speed, check.
[laughing]

722
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,323
[stammers] I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

723
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,107
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

724
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,065
-[man whimpering]
-I doused him
with pepper spray.

725
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,676
Smart move.

726
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,505
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady
her purse back.

727
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,681
I'm your age.

728
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:36,162
And he didn't get a chance
to take it 'cause I didn't
let him take it.

729
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,599
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top
of this stuff.

730
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,732
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

731
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,562
Regular-aged ladies
like yourself don't need
your protecting, right?

732
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:45,911
So get woke, bro.

733
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:47,347
I'm sorry, who are you?

734
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:50,393
His name is Thundercrack,

735
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,093
hero to the people
with all the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

736
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,137
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

737
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,444
[stammers]

738
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,793
Mister Philadelphia.

739
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,403
That's a cream cheese thing,
dude!

740
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,275
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got
all the powers.

741
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,712
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

742
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:06,584
Power Boy, do you know
this child?

743
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,937
[stammers] Like a teeny
little bit.
I don't really know...

744
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,634
Yeah. He's like
a little miniature manager.

745
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,897
-I'm his manager.
-[stammers]

746
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:18,291
But Power Boy's
not gonna work, either, okay?
So work on something else.

747
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:19,858
Hey, bud, what could...

748
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,511
[yelping]

749
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,953
Electricity manipulation,
hyper-speed, super-strength.

750
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,476
Dude, you're stacked!

751
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:31,217
You're almost as cool
as Superman. Almost.

752
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:33,306
I didn't see you.
I don't know
what just happened here.

753
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:35,090
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

754
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:36,439
I'm not doing it
for the money.

755
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:38,050
Thank you for
your kind donation.

756
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:39,704
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

757
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,619
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

758
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:44,578
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

759
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,319
-Seventy-three bucks?
-[exclaims in delight]

760
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:47,886
Come on!

761
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,715
Hey, wait a minute.

762
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,151
I just got an idea.

763
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:53,892
[bell dings]

764
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,111
I'd like to purchase some of
your finest beer, please.

765
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:57,591
[Muzak playing]

766
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,524
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have
a fake ID even.

767
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,482
Freddy, Freddy,
would you relax?

768
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,311
-Look at me.
I am the fake ID.
-[chuckles]

769
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:23,617
-[bell dings]
-[man] Everything
from the register!

770
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,314
-Go, go! Now!
-[cashier screams]

771
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,752
Come on! We don't have
any time.
Let's go. Move!

772
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,188
We want it all! Hurry.

773
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:30,493
This is your chance.

774
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:34,062
Oh! Okay.

775
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:36,108
Come on,
come on, come on!
Let's do this!

776
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:37,936
That's it. That's it.

777
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:41,679
Gentlemen,

778
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,681
why use guns
when we can handle this
like real men?

779
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:47,510
-Billy, look out!
-[groans]

780
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,787
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

781
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:04,484
I'm bulletproof.

782
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,094
[Freddy laughing]

783
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,270
-[cell phone beeps]
-Today is December 8th,

784
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,620
and this is video proof of
authenticity.

785
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:13,536
Shoot him again.

786
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:15,103
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here. Go. Both of you!

787
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,452
Come on. Go to town.

788
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,591
Wait, wait, wait.

789
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:26,680
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

790
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,290
or if you are.

791
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:30,640
Shoot him in the face.

792
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,251
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

793
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,428
[grunting]

794
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,517
[guns clicking]

795
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,651
It kinda tickles.

796
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,783
[both laugh]

797
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,784
You're dead.

798
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:45,394
[both screaming]

799
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,226
-Sorry about your window.
-Have a good night!

800
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,620
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

801
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:56,754
[man] Come on!
Let's get outta here.

802
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,364
Hey.

803
00:45:58,451 --> 00:45:59,974
-To fighting bad guys.
[chuckles]
-Yeah.

804
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,021
[Freddy] Bleh!

805
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,110
Ugh!

806
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:06,938
That tastes
like actual vomit.

807
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,504
-[bell dings]
-[Shazam chuckling]

808
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,855
Hey, do you know
habanero jerky,

809
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:13,683
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole
in your stomach?

810
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,902
Worth it.

811
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:16,382
Yeah.
Probably not you, though.

812
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:17,818
You've probably got
stomach superpowers.

813
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:19,341
Probably. Oh, hey.

814
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:20,516
What's up?
I'm a superhero.

815
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:22,257
Yeah, his name is, uh,

816
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:23,911
Captain Sparklefingers.

817
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,044
No, it's not. No, it's not!
That's not my name.

818
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,481
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

819
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,135
-Oh, okay. I'm out.
-[siren wails]

820
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:31,397
Hey, wait up!

821
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:40,580
[Shazam] I mean,
it's a pretty sick view.

822
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,670
I totally get why Rocky
was training so hard
to get up here.

823
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:48,327
You know,
I like you like this.
This is so cool.

824
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:51,504
I mean, no offense,

825
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:56,161
but, like, at first you were
kinda like the opposite
of how Darla is.

826
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:57,292
[yawns]

827
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,511
A dick?

828
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:00,861
[yawns] Your words.
Not mine.

829
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:02,341
But yeah.

830
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,518
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

831
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:07,563
is either on drugs or asleep
by now.

832
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,913
Wanna head home?

833
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:11,350
Looking like this?

834
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,004
Well, yeah,

835
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,789
I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair
to go back to,

836
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,922
but that's long-term.

837
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:20,446
Right now, we have
a bunk bed. [laughs]

838
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:24,624
[Christmas music playing]

839
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,148
Just scares me
thinking of him out there
all alone.

840
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:30,325
This is what he does, Rosa.

841
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,632
Difference is,
when they find him,

842
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,895
we'll be the first
to take him back.

843
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,288
With open arms.

844
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,291
[laughs]

845
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:42,033
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

846
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,774
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

847
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,776
At least I did.

848
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,996
-Yeah.
-Even Mary did it.

849
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,345
Hmm? Twice.

850
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,306
That second time
she ran off,

851
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,612
you said something to me
I'll never forget.

852
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:58,571
You said,

853
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,790
"It's not a home
until you call it a home.

854
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,575
It's something you choose."

855
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:09,016
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

856
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:12,280
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,
that's up to him.

857
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:15,762
Yeah.

858
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,983
You gonna help me
with this tree?

859
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,549
[Rosa laughs tearfully]

860
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:22,116
-[Rosa] This tree's so sad.
-[stair creaks]

861
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,728
Hello?

[Freddy] Got lost
finding the bathroom.

863
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:29,689
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie.
Good night.

864
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:31,038
-[Freddy] Good night.
-[Shazam] Night.

865
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:31,996
[Shazam exclaims softly]

866
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,042
Freddy, who is that?

867
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:37,392
It's Billy. He's just really
tired and he has laryngitis.

868
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:38,611
What? Laryngitis!

869
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,656
I'm just kidding!
I'm just kidding.

870
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:42,397
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go
to beddy-bye.

871
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:43,746
-Beddy-bye?
Who says beddy-bye?
-Just hide, hide.

872
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,271
Billy, you're back.
Let us see you.

873
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:48,621
We've been so worried
about you.

874
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,405
I told you
this was a bad idea!

[Shazam gasping]

877
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:54,322
[Rosa] Freddy,
what happened to the stairs?

878
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,021
[muffled] Mmm!

879
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,370
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

880
00:48:58,457 --> 00:48:59,806
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

881
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,376
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

882
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,594
A wizard made me
look like this.

883
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:06,944
Maybe don't start
with "wizard."

884
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,033
It's just gonna make her
more confused.

885
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,122
Some old guy brought me
to a temple and he made
me say, "Shazam."

886
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,777
Rosa!

887
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,041
[Freddy] Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

888
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:18,303
You can switch
by saying, "Shazam."

889
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:23,656
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

890
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:25,092
Uh...

891
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,790
I was screwing in a bulb.

892
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:30,576
Listen to me, Darla.
You cannot tell anybody
about this, all right?

893
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,752
But it's Billy.
He's a hero.

894
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,145
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

895
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,885
that endangers us, okay?

896
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,801
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

897
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:40,325
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

898
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:41,979
-Moderate.
-No.

899
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,023
Oh, God.

900
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,938
Okay, listen, D,

901
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:47,027
you cannot tell
a single soul about this,
all right? Please?

902
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:49,725
Why? What if it's people
we trust?

903
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,728
[Billy sighs]

904
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,817
Because good sisters
don't tell secrets.

905
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,385
-I'm a good sister.
-[Freddy] Yeah, you are.

906
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:59,170
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

907
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:00,345
Is if you fixed
the doorknob for us, okay?

908
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:01,694
Yeah.

909
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:03,478
-Sweet dreams.
-Sweet dreams. Bye.

910
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:04,914
-See you in the morning.
-Good night.

[elevator bell dings]

912
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,357
Hello, sir.
How may I help you?

913
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,794
Hi. Sir?

914
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,144
Sir, you can't go in there.
Excuse me!

915
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:19,364
-You cannot go in there!

[sighs]

918
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:24,717
Sorry I'm late.

919
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:26,893
Thad, this is for
board members only.

920
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,329
I'm aware of that, Father.

921
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:32,116
[beeps]

922
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:37,295
Now, that night in the car.

923
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:41,342
I swore to you
I saw something,
but you never believed me.

924
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:45,172
So much easier to blame me,
wasn't it?

925
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,783
And say that if
I hadn't screamed
that night,

926
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,220
you'd still have your legs.

927
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,701
Well, now I have proof.

928
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,836
That's enough, Thad.

929
00:50:56,923 --> 00:51:01,058
Dear Sid, you think?

930
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:05,279
You know,
even before the accident,
you belittled me.

931
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:08,239
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

932
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:10,545
You don't need
to make a scene.

933
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,069
Oh, brother,

934
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:14,549
the scene
has only just begun.

935
00:51:18,162 --> 00:51:19,815
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

936
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:21,165
What?

937
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:22,340
Ask the ball
if you're man enough

938
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:23,645
to throw me
out of this room.

00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,477

You can't go crying
to other people
all the time.

all this material
you've accumulated

975
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:45,134
amounts to actual power?

976
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:50,444
This is power.

977

found his champion.

Kill the champion
before he learns
his true potential,

982

or he will defeat you.

983

And I can't?

1011

Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

1012
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,954

hatching schemes.

No. Never am I up

00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,422
Sure, kid.

00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,641
Look, parents or guardians

1026
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:10,905
must appear physically
to check out students.

00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,168
Gotcha.

00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,170

I'm gonna talk to him
about that. I apologize.

Anyway, this is me

00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:16,754
Oh. Oh.

1053
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,496
[grunts]

1054
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,803
[laughing]

1055
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:27,982
[laughs]

1056
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,600
[yelping]

1057
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:37,731
-[groans]
-[Freddy] Are you okay?

1058
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:39,733
[Freddy grunts]

1059
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,259
[grunts]

1060
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,305
[exclaims, laughs]

1061
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,661
[exclaims]

1062
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:15,595
[gasping]

1063
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,379
I'm sorry! [screams]

1064
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,404
More powerful
than a locomotive.

1065
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:45,843
Locomotive.
What are you?
An old prospector?

1066
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,062
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

1067
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,154
[Freddy] Single bound.

1068
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,766
[grunts]

1069
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:57,419
-[people screaming]
-[Shazam] Oh!

1070
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:58,682
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

1071
00:59:58,769 --> 00:59:59,900
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

1072
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:01,162
-Your phone's charged.
-Wow!

1073
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:02,860
Your phone's charged.

1074
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,166
Your phone's charged.

1075
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:07,560
You really need like
a mic drop catchphrase
after you do some cool shit.

1076
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:08,996
I've been thinking
about that.

1077
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:11,042
What about this?

1078
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:13,305
"That's why you don't mess
with electricity."
[mimics mic drop]

1079
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:15,176
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of
your superpowers.

1080
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,961
And your phone's charged.

1081
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:19,354
-Well, you think
you can do better?
-What the hell?

1082
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:21,530
Let there be light.

1083
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,620
[Shazam grunting]

1084
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:26,971
Yeah, yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby, okay.

1085
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,104
[stomach grumbles]

1086
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,630
How do I... Never mind.

1087
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:34,674
Shazam!

1088
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:37,155
[screaming]

1089
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:38,460
[toilet flushes]

1090
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,636
[Billy] Shazam!

1091
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,559
[Freddy] What'd you see?
What'd you see?
Were there boobies?

1092
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,649
You see nipples?
Why aren't you talking?

1093
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:55,869
We're gonna need more money.

1094
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:57,044
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

1095
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,480
Dude, they were
very convincing!

1096
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:04,835
Oh, get it, get it!

1097
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,229
Go, go, go!

1098
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:09,796
[Shazam whooping]

1099
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,801
[Freddy] No!

1100
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,021
Stop! No!

1101
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,326
-I'm not even looking!
-Stop!

1102
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,546
-I'm not even looking! Oh!
-Stop!

1103
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:22,374
-Why?
-Oh, and done!

1104
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:23,854
Finished him.

1105
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,294
A lair.

1106
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,687
Yes.

1107
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,253
And obviously,
we're gonna have to

1108
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,037
-be making this purchase
anonymously.
-Mmm.

1109
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:35,343
Obviously.

1110
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,042
And, um, if you have
a location on a cliff.

1111
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:40,000
Like a castle-esque
type thing.

1112
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,523
-Overlooking some water.
-[Freddy] Overlooking
some water,

1113
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,308
seas, below it.
Rough, you know...

1114
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:45,266
Like a waterfall,

1115
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:47,007
-so you can drive into...
-Waterfall, yeah.
If you... Yeah.

1116
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:49,531
Look, Maximum Voltage,
is it?

1117
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:51,751
You can call me Max.

1118
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,884
Look, Max, why don't you
just start with

1119
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:55,276
how many bedrooms
you're looking for?

1120
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:56,495
-One!
-Seven.

1121
01:01:56,582 --> 01:01:57,931
-One?
-Seven?

1122
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,237
What, am I running
a foster home now?

1123
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:06,810
[students chattering]

1124
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:13,338
[girl] Have you seen the one
where he throws
the football into space?

1125
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:15,253
[boy] So dope.

1126
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,602
Hey, you guys
gotta wonder who's
filming those, right?

1127
01:02:16,689 --> 01:02:18,822
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

1128
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:20,345
I mean, is it, though?

1129
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:22,477
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

1130
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:24,001
[Billy] Holding a camera?

1131
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:26,568
[scoffs] Staring in the face
of danger.

1132
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:28,005
Like some weirdo fanboy.

1133
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:30,877
Hey, Freeman.

1134
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:32,923
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1135
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:36,013
What, is your bestie
gonna hit us with
a wheelchair this time?

1136
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,536
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

1137
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:39,016
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

1138
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,106
Okay, Freddy.

1139
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:44,586
You may have heard of him.
[stuttering]
The Human Power Storm.

1140
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:46,893
Frequency Flinger.
Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

1141
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,721
Yeah. He's a man
of many names.

1142
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:49,983
[Burke] You know
the Red Cyclone?

1143
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,856
You? [scoffs] My ass you do.

1144
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:54,771
Oh, we're a lot closer
than you think.

1145
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:56,773
Maybe even at this
very moment.

1146
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,600
Prove it.

1147
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,994
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna
come to lunch.

1148
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,127
Right, right, Billy?

1149
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,172
Oh, yeah, and then
Superman's gonna be
bringing us dessert, right?

1150
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:06,739
[school bell ringing]

1151
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:10,264
Tomorrow at lunch.
You'll see.

1152
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:13,441
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

1153
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:20,231
So, wait, my identity's
a secret so no one I know
can get hurt.

1154
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:23,147
Except when it makes you
look cool,
then it's all good.

1155
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:24,670
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

1156
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,759
They're just super douchebags.

1157
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:29,153
So, you're breaking
your own rule?

1158
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,024
Got it.

1159
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,811
[scoffs] This thing
is as much as mine
as it is yours.

1160
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,465
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

1161
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:39,859
Billy, you're still
gonna do it, though, right?

1162
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:41,861
-I mean, what would
a good brother do?
-[door slams]

1163
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:44,951
[Victor] All hands on deck.

1164
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:51,523
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

1165
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,918
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's
on vacay.

1166
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:01,925
Big news in Philly.
Got a costumed hero.

1167
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:03,230
He's doing good.

1168
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:05,276
[Eugene] Yeah,
but is he, though?

1169
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:08,235
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

1170
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:11,717
Share with us
your perspective, Eugene.

1171
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:14,676
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1172
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,549
So what?
I can charge a phone
with a plug.

1173
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:18,593
[Victor] Preach.

1174
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:22,206
Pedro, any thoughts?

1175
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:24,251
-Costume's stupid.
-[all laughing]

1176
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:26,210
-Yeah.
-[Victor] Okay.

1177
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:27,733
Big white cape like
he's getting married
or something.

1178
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,040
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1179
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:32,303
Ever think about that?

1180
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,261
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1181
01:04:34,348 --> 01:04:38,309
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see
the positive.

1182
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:40,311
Okay, well,
I think it looks like

1183
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:42,661
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1184
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:45,055
[Victor] Very specific.
All right.

1185
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:46,578
Maybe to the superhero,

1186
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:48,145
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1187
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:49,624
Clingy?
Wow, interesting take.

1188
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:51,017
[Billy] You know,
maybe sometimes

1189
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:53,977
a superhero just wants
a little me time.

1190
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,848
You know, me time
could also be construed

1191
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:57,197
as pushing away his family.

1192
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:59,243
Family. Is that what
they are now?

1193
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,419
[Freddy]
It's a classic symptom of
"Superhero Syndrome."

1194
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:05,031
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

1195
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:08,252
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1196
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:09,514
[spoon clatters]

1197
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,559
Son, we're still
eating dinner.

1198
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,387
What he needs is a sidekick.

1199
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:16,129
Name one cool sidekick.

1200
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:18,349
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

1201
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:20,525
You're never at a loss
for words.

1202
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:22,135
[mouth full] I'm eating.

1203
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,356
-[bell ringing]
-[students chattering]

1204
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:34,931
[Billy]
Why am I still doing this?

1205
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:37,411
[sighs] Well,
you can't skip every day.

1206
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:39,544
Not at your age.

1207
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,720
But I'm not your age anymore.

1208
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,417
But I can go with you.

1209
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:45,767
We just gotta
trick the guard out,
you know?

1210
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:47,726
Billy, where are you going?
[stutters]

1211
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:49,119
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1212
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,947
Billy!

1213
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:55,125
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's
still gonna eat
in the cafeteria, right?

1214
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:57,170
-[bell ringing]
-[grumbling]

1215
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,436
[camera shutter clicking]

1216
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,526
All right.

1217
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,485
Did you check it to...

1218
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:11,271
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

1219
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:13,491
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

-Ooh!

-Oh, my God.
-Mary, are you okay?

1223
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:29,768
How do you know my name?

1224
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,553
Uh... How do I know
your name? Uh...

1225
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,295
One of my superpowers
is name guessing.

1226
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,341
Which is really weird, I bet.

1227
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:39,952
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

1228
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,650
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1229
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:44,304
Are you hurt?

1230
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:47,960
[voice breaking]
No, I'm okay.
Thank you. Um...

1231
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:49,875
[sighs shakily]

1232
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,399
I just need a second to think.

1233
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:54,793
This has been
such a weird day.

1234
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,449
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

1235
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:00,668
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1236
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,192
in your hand.

1237
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:04,542
Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1238
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,025
I got in.

1239
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:14,030
[stammers] Well,
now my superpowers
are failing me

1240
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,814
and I am very confused.

1241
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:19,600
Yeah. Me, too.

1242
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:21,907
I don't know.
I know I should be excited

1243
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:24,344
'cause this is my dream
and I've worked
really, really hard for this,

1244
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:26,346
but it's like...

1245
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:31,569
I don't know.
Leaving my family does not
feel fun, you know?

1246
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:34,746
[stammers] Could I give you
a little piece of advice?

1247
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,617
Don't be worried
about everybody else.

1248
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:38,532
Always look out
for number one.

1249
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,056
Gandhi said that.

1250
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,970
-I don't think he said that.
-Yeah, he did.

1251
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,276
-Gandhi did not say...
-Somebody like Gandhi
said that.

1252
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:44,886
"Take care of number one."

1253
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:46,410
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

1254
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:48,281
-Listen.
-I'm sorry, no.

1255
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,718
Agree to disagree.
The point is,
you do you, you know?

1256
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:52,372
You gotta look out for you.

1257
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:54,200
And get as far away
from this place as you can.

1258
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,204
I don't know if I want to.

1259
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,988
Of course you do.
What're you gonna do?

1260
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,947
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

1261
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,255
Look, families are for people

1262
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:07,300
who can't take care
of themselves, okay? So...

1263
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,869
And you can take care
of yourself.

1264
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:12,827

you cross the street.

How can I help you?

I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

your underwear like that

1389
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:10,358
What made you so worthy?

1390
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,839
I'm sorry, can I help...

1391
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:14,145
Do you want an autograph
or something?

1392
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:15,842
Give me your power.

1393
01:14:18,323 --> 01:14:19,716
Or die.

1394
01:14:19,803 --> 01:14:22,980
Oh, snap! You're, like,
a bad guy, right?

1395
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:26,287
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets
really stupid for you,

1396
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:28,464
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

-[officer] I said,
stop right there!
-[both grunt]

1401

The only thing
that extinguishes magic...

1402
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:46,438
is magic.

1403
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:50,224
Time to transfer
your power to me.

did you, grandpa?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1410
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,204
I never should've punched you
in the nuts like that.

1411
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:14,248
That was totally my bad.

1412
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:15,598
We can talk about this.

1413
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,208
You grovel like a child.

1414
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,340
That's because I am one.
I'm a kid!

1415
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:20,777
You don't wanna hurt a kid,
do you?

I believe I can fly,
I can fly!

Freddy said if I believe
I can fly, then I can fly.

1419
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,613
So I believe!
I believe! I believe!

1420
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,570
Okay.

1421
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:32,745
Superman!

1422
01:15:32,832 --> 01:15:35,095
Superman! What arm is it?

1423
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:36,662
Why am I not flying?

1424
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:38,229

and Mrs. Claus do
in the summertime?

You don't have to

I don't need to read
your mind.

1497
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:52,788
Because you are
going to tell me.

1498

telling me
you've been cutting class!

Whoa! Is that...

1515
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:42,402
 I'm questioning his motive.

1516
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:45,710
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

[newscasters continue

1518

doing with Freddy?

when Billy and Freddy
were arguing

1521
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:02,379
like an old married couple,
like this?

1522
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:04,816
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived
in a group home.

1523
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:07,079
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

[newscasters continue

1525
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:19,004
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1526
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:20,876
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1527
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:22,442
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1528
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:25,097
-I didn't break any promises.
-You knew?

1529
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:26,664
I'm a good sister!

1530
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:33,410
[Victor] I mean,
what were you thinking?

1531
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:35,238
And then you bring
Freddy into it.

1532
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:44,160
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

1533
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:55,214
[Mary] Billy?

1534
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:01,699
You're him.

1535
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,093
You're the hero.

1536
01:22:05,398 --> 01:22:07,139
Yeah, well,
not anymore, so...

1537
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:09,489
[sighs]

1538
01:22:12,318 --> 01:22:14,494
Why do you have my notebook?

1539
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,063
Eugene finished your search.

1540
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:21,588
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1541
01:22:21,675 --> 01:22:24,026
But I have played 
Watch Dogsand Uplink.

1542
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:27,203
And maybe I did pick up
a few skills,
which maybe did get me

1543
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,248
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

1544
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:31,468
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1545
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:35,211
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1546
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,174
What?

1547
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:44,046
[Eugene] You were born
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1548
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:45,830
They divorced
when you were three.

1549
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,658
Your mom moved here
that year.

1550
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,790
Twenty months later,
you got lost.

1551
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:51,792
You never found them

1552
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:53,925
'cause your dad's been
in prison in Florida
for ten years.

1553
01:22:54,012 --> 01:22:55,187
And your mom's...

1554
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:58,016
What?

1555
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,498
Is she dead?

1556
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:03,152
She's two subway stops away.

1557
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:06,764
What?

1558
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,810
You know, you didn't find her
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1559
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:12,552
[door slams]

1560
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:16,078
[Rosa] Hey, Billy! Billy!

1561
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:21,648
-Victor, get the keys.
-I got it.

1562
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,737
[Rosa] Kids, stay here
in case Billy comes back.

1563
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:29,091
[tires screeching]

1564
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,225
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1565
01:23:41,973 --> 01:23:44,541
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

1566
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:47,283
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1567
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:50,938
[doorbell rings]

1568
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,244
Billy?

1569
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:55,900
Freddy?

1570
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:58,816
[Freddy grunts]

1571
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:02,385
Oh, how quaint.

1572
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:07,172
Actually, I take that back.

1573
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:11,350
What a shithole.

1574
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:37,681
[couple arguing]

1575
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:39,074
[glass shattering]

1576
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:40,292
[loud thump]

1577
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:41,598
[argument continues]

1578
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:51,521
[exhales]

1579
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:55,655
[woman] Just a second.

1580
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,401
Hey, look, I'm late
for work already, all right?

1581
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:04,838
We don't need
any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

1582
01:25:04,925 --> 01:25:06,666
Oh, I'm not.

1583
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:09,060
You probably
don't recognize me...

1584
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:12,194
but I found my way home.

1585
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,631
Mom.

1586
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:17,764
It's me.

1587
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,115
Oh, God.

1588
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:22,421
Is it?

1589
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,513
Um... Hang on.

1590
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:30,081
[man] Who's at the door?

1591
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,258
It's, um...

1592
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:35,173
It's no one, Travis.

1593
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:41,614
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1594
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:44,617
No.

1595
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:47,185
Listen, um...

1596
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:50,362
It's really you, huh?

1597
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:57,413
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

1598
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,155
I let go, but it was
by accident. [stuttering]

1599
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:01,939
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1600
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,159
I saw you.

1601
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,422
What?

1602
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,209
I saw you after.

1603
01:26:14,081 --> 01:26:18,129
So, it was never your fault.

1604
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:22,829
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

1605
01:26:22,916 --> 01:26:26,616
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1606
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:30,837
 And I was hurting, 
and I was screwed up.

1607
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:33,144
[sighs]

1608
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,885
-I want the tiger.
-I know.

1609
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:36,713
I know, honey,

1610
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,411
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

1611
01:26:41,979 --> 01:26:43,241
Billy?

1612
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:44,764
Billy!

1613
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,332
Billy?

1614
01:26:47,419 --> 01:26:50,030
Jesus Christ.
Billy, this isn't funny!

1615
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,858
Here you go, buddy.

1616
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,861
That should warm you up.
Is that better?

1617
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:57,429
[sniffles]

1618
01:26:57,516 --> 01:27:00,737
[Marilyn] Look, it's just once 
I saw you with the police,

1619
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:02,956
 I realized that they could do

1620
01:27:03,043 --> 01:27:05,611
 a better job taking care 
of you than I ever will.

1621
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:12,618
But you're good, right?

1622
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:17,319
I mean,
you landed on your feet.

1623
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,103
Because, I mean,
you look real good.

1624
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,454
It's just...

1625
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:28,112
now is not a really good time
for me, Bill.

1626
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:37,252
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

1627
01:27:39,123 --> 01:27:42,039
[sighs] but I have to get back
to my real family.

1628
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:45,216
Here.

1629
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:50,787
What's this?

1630
01:27:50,874 --> 01:27:54,051
[Travis] Marilyn!
What's goin' on out there?

1631
01:27:54,138 --> 01:27:55,661
You might need it
more than me.

1632
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:07,369
[cell phone vibrating]

1633
01:28:13,636 --> 01:28:16,203
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1634
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,903
[Dr. Sivana] Come home, Billy. 
Come home.

1635
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:23,515
[Freddy] Billy! Supervillain! 
Supervillain![whimpers]

1636
01:28:39,749 --> 01:28:40,750
Shazam!

1637
01:28:53,153 --> 01:28:54,590
[wreath clatters]

1638
01:28:54,677 --> 01:28:57,157
Who are you? What do you want?

1639
01:28:57,244 --> 01:28:58,942
What do I want?

1640
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:00,726
-I want...
-[thunder rumbling]

1641
01:29:05,688 --> 01:29:06,689
That.

1642
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,126
Whoa.

1643
01:29:12,608 --> 01:29:14,349
Kick his ass, Billy!

1644
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:17,743
[children whimpering]

1645
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:19,397
[Dr. Sivana] Yes, Billy.

1646
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,138
-Try it, by all means.
-[snarls]

1647
01:29:21,225 --> 01:29:23,270
Let them go
and I'll come inside.

1648
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,316
[Dr. Sivana]
No, first, you come inside,

1649
01:29:25,403 --> 01:29:26,883
then maybe I'll let them go.

1650
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,147
[snarling]

1651
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:31,235
[all gasp]

1652
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:45,467
Good boy.

1653
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,297
Because that's all you are,
isn't it?

1654
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:52,299
How old are you?

1655
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,650
-Basically 15.
-Hmm.

1656
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,612
When I was a child,
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1657
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:04,834
Yet here you are, a coward.

1658
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:09,229
Run from me
and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1659
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:12,885
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1660
01:30:12,972 --> 01:30:14,670
Give me the power
of the champion.

1661
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:15,932
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1662
01:30:32,949 --> 01:30:35,386
Give me the power
and I'll let them go.

1663
01:30:35,473 --> 01:30:37,170
Darla, no.

1664
01:30:37,257 --> 01:30:39,477
Don't go, Billy.

1665
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:41,610
-[crying] Don't go, Billy.
-Darla, come here.

1666
01:30:41,697 --> 01:30:43,525
[Shazam stammering]
No, I have to.

1667
01:30:43,612 --> 01:30:46,397
It's what a good brother
would do. Right?

1668
01:30:51,402 --> 01:30:52,447
Billy.

1669
01:31:11,683 --> 01:31:13,206

[coughs]

1672
01:31:18,995 --> 01:31:21,650
[Dr. Sivana] I dedicated
my life to getting here.

1673
01:31:22,738 --> 01:31:24,914
I scoured the earth.

1674
01:31:25,001 --> 01:31:26,437
No one believed me.

1675
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:29,048
-[continues groaning]
-No one helped.

1676
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:30,485
Not the wizard.

1677
01:31:31,703 --> 01:31:32,835
Not my family.

1678
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,143
I only had myself.

1679
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,405
[Shazam] I get it.

1680
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,278
[panting]
I get what that's like.

1681
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:45,108
Feeling like
you're all alone in the world.

1682
01:31:45,195 --> 01:31:47,371
Stand.

1683
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:49,373
Feeling like
there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

1684
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,375
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1685
01:31:51,462 --> 01:31:52,463
Stand.

1686
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:57,424
The champion's name.

1687
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,338
[bangs staff]

1688
01:31:58,425 --> 01:31:59,426
Say it.

1689
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:04,910
[wind howling]

[Seven Deadly Sins snarling]

1691
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:28,760
Look, no offense, mister,

1692
01:32:28,847 --> 01:32:31,154
but I don't think
these things have
your best interest at heart.

1693
01:32:31,241 --> 01:32:34,636
[Lust] Don't listen
to this child.

1694
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:37,290
[Wrath] Take the staff.
[snarls]

1695
01:32:37,377 --> 01:32:42,208
[Sloth] Hold it
and say the champion's name.

1696
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:44,384
They're using you.

1697
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:46,865
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1698
01:32:46,952 --> 01:32:48,084
[Dr. Sivana] Say your name.

1699
01:32:51,609 --> 01:32:52,523
[Freddy] His name...

1700
01:32:53,829 --> 01:32:55,918
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1701
01:32:56,005 --> 01:32:58,137
And we're gonna
keep throwing things
at your big,

fat, ugly-eyed head,

1703
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:02,098
until you let our brother go.

[both grunt]

1706
01:33:26,818 --> 01:33:28,994
Boy, am I glad
I didn't sell that Batarang.

1707
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:30,953
-Pedro, is that a lamp?
-[Pedro] It's an ugly one.

1708
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,694
[Shazam] Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1709
01:33:32,781 --> 01:33:34,565
Guys,
I appreciate the thought,

1710
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:36,219
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1711
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:37,786
You can put 'em down now.

1712
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:40,615
The door was right here.

1713
01:33:40,702 --> 01:33:42,486
Billy, how do we
get outta here?

1714
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:43,618
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1715
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:45,794
This way!

1716
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,404
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1717

Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

Darla, I don't know.

1742
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:18,582
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1743
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:20,715
Uh, last time,
I thought about the subway,
and I was on the subway.

1744
01:35:20,802 --> 01:35:22,717
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1745
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:25,154
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

[Darla] Why are you
covering my eyes?

1750
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,356
Really? This is the first
place you think of? Wow!

1751

You're welcome!

1752
01:35:54,879 --> 01:35:56,228
[Darla] Why can't I see
what's inside?

1753
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:57,795
You are not old enough.

1754
01:35:57,882 --> 01:35:59,754
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1755
01:36:00,493 --> 01:36:01,451
Not my thing.

1756

Can I get glitter?

[woman] Who is that guy?

1793
01:37:36,633 --> 01:37:38,809

1795
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:44,423

01:38:30,295 --> 01:38:32,210
Well, you wanted
me to be a hero.

1806
01:38:32,297 --> 01:38:33,559
Are you kidding?

1807
01:38:33,646 --> 01:38:35,387
Okay, no.

Plus, he has
the same powers as you.

1810

Plus, I mean,
he knows what he's doing.

Plus, I mean,
you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

1812
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,485
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1813
01:38:47,834 --> 01:38:48,923
he's not much of a hero.

1814
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:54,972

When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

the Batarang hurt him.

-Trust me. Divide and conquer.

-We're fine. It's okay.
-All right, all right,
all right.

2087
01:57:12,764 --> 01:57:14,114
[Super Hero Pedro] We're good.

2088
01:57:14,201 --> 01:57:16,333
-[cheering continues]
-[whooping]

2089
01:57:24,211 --> 01:57:25,821
[Shazam] You sure
this is gonna work?

2090
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:29,085
[Super Hero Freddy] Told ya.

2091
01:57:29,172 --> 01:57:30,347
[Super Hero Mary] Whoa!

2092
01:57:32,175 --> 01:57:33,220
[Super Hero Freddy] Whoa!

2093
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,404
[laughter]

2094
01:57:48,017 --> 01:57:49,453
You guys know
what this place is, right?

2095
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:52,674
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

2096
01:57:52,761 --> 01:57:55,372
Well, yes, but also...

2097
01:57:57,722 --> 01:58:01,248
[gasps] Lair! We got a lair!

2098
01:58:01,335 --> 01:58:02,597
-[softly] Lair.
-Yeah.

2099
01:58:02,684 --> 01:58:04,033
-[Shazam laughing]
-No, you right.

2100
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,252
-[Super Hero Mary laughs]
-We got a lair.

2101
01:58:07,254 --> 01:58:09,343
What's a lair?

2102
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:11,214
 And thanks to six superheroes,

2103
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:13,216
 citizens are back 
in their homes,

2104
01:58:13,303 --> 01:58:15,392
 safe again 
with their families.

2105
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:17,916
 And here with 
an eyewitness account 
of the events...

2106
01:58:18,003 --> 01:58:20,223
 It was[bleep] crazy, man!

2107
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:22,269
 Creatures from[bleep] hell!

2108
01:58:22,356 --> 01:58:24,923
 Lightning coming out of everyone's[bleep] everything!

2109
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:27,752
 And that is not
[bleep] cool, man!

2110
01:58:27,839 --> 01:58:29,885
[Freddy] So, first day
as a superhero.

2111
01:58:29,972 --> 01:58:33,018
[Eugene] Automatic top spot
for best ever.

2112
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:35,020
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

2113
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:37,022
-No. That's racist.
-[Eugene] Not if I say it.

2114
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,981
Guys.

2115
01:58:39,068 --> 01:58:40,461
-All hands on deck.
-[Eugene] Oh!

2116
01:58:40,548 --> 01:58:41,636
[laughing]

2117
01:58:43,159 --> 01:58:44,943
[Rosa] Wait, wait, wait.
[laughs]

2118
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:46,075
Wait.

2119
01:58:46,162 --> 01:58:47,772
Thank you for this food.

2120
01:58:47,859 --> 01:58:49,905
Thank you for this day.

2121
01:58:49,992 --> 01:58:52,037
Thank you for this family.

2122
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:54,257
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

2123
01:58:54,344 --> 01:58:55,519
[Victor chuckles]

2124
01:58:55,606 --> 01:58:57,652
I mean, after all,

2125
01:58:58,435 --> 01:58:59,306
I'm home.

2126
01:59:03,527 --> 01:59:04,702
[chuckles]

2127
01:59:05,834 --> 01:59:07,140
[indistinct chatter]

2128
01:59:11,056 --> 01:59:12,057
[laughter]

2129
01:59:14,973 --> 01:59:16,236
[students chattering]

2130
01:59:31,425 --> 01:59:33,166
[girl] He better not sit
at our table.

2131
01:59:36,734 --> 01:59:37,866
Nope!

2132
01:59:40,129 --> 01:59:41,130
Okay.

2133
01:59:44,742 --> 01:59:46,222
What are you doing?

2134
01:59:46,309 --> 01:59:48,311
Waiting for your imaginary BFF
to show up?

2135
01:59:48,398 --> 01:59:49,573
[Burke] Yeah.

2136
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,879
[grunts]

2137
01:59:58,234 --> 01:59:59,583
What are you guys doing here?

2138
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:01,194
Well, we're having lunch
with you.

2139
02:00:01,281 --> 02:00:03,108
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

2140
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:06,677
Well, we made
a very special arrangement.

2141
02:00:06,764 --> 02:00:09,854
-Darla, what's going on?
-[mouth full]
Why are you asking me?

2142
02:00:09,941 --> 02:00:10,986
Freddy Freeman.

2143
02:00:11,073 --> 02:00:12,117
[students gasp]

2144
02:00:13,423 --> 02:00:15,208
This guy

2145
02:00:15,295 --> 02:00:18,776
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

2146
02:00:18,863 --> 02:00:21,126
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

2147
02:00:21,214 --> 02:00:25,740
What's going on,
my best bud
in the whole world?

2148
02:00:25,827 --> 02:00:30,092
And also new kids that
I'm meeting for the first time
but seem very cool?

2149
02:00:30,179 --> 02:00:31,615
Uh... [chuckles]

2150
02:00:31,702 --> 02:00:34,227
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

2151
02:00:36,577 --> 02:00:37,969
[students gasping]

2152
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:42,322
[gasps loudly]

2153
02:03:29,227 --> 02:03:30,881
[Dr. Sivana grunting]

2154
02:03:30,968 --> 02:03:35,495
Sun of Ra.

2155
02:03:36,452 --> 02:03:43,067
Ouroboros.

2156
02:03:43,154 --> 02:03:44,808
[breathing heavily]

2157
02:03:44,895 --> 02:03:48,421
Solomon's...

2158
02:03:48,508 --> 02:03:51,032
Knot.

2159
02:03:57,604 --> 02:03:59,997
-[pencil breaks]
-[groans]

2160
02:04:00,084 --> 02:04:01,869
[screaming]

2161
02:04:01,956 --> 02:04:05,699
No! No!

2162
02:04:05,786 --> 02:04:07,440
[panting]

2163
02:04:09,354 --> 02:04:11,792
[voice laughing]

2164
02:04:11,879 --> 02:04:14,795
[voice on speaker] 
Primitive symbols.

2165
02:04:14,882 --> 02:04:20,235
 You walking, talking monkeys 
with your cave drawings.

2166
02:04:20,322 --> 02:04:24,369
 You assume there's only 
one way to gain magic.

2167
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:27,460
 No, no, no.

2168
02:04:27,547 --> 02:04:30,419
 There are more ways 
than a mind can imagine.

2169
02:04:31,507 --> 02:04:33,422
What in God's name?

2170
02:04:33,509 --> 02:04:37,992
 I name the gods, Doctor. 
Not the other way around.

2171
02:04:38,079 --> 02:04:41,256
 Oh, what fun 
we're going to have together.

2172
02:04:41,343 --> 02:04:45,478
 The Seven Realms 
are about to be ours.

2173
02:04:45,565 --> 02:04:47,131
[laughing]

2174
02:11:08,512 --> 02:11:09,774
[shushing]

2175
02:11:11,733 --> 02:11:13,953
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

2176
02:11:14,823 --> 02:11:16,607
[laughs] Yeah, I'm sure.

2177
02:11:16,694 --> 02:11:19,001
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

2178
02:11:19,088 --> 02:11:20,611
[laughs]

2179
02:11:20,698 --> 02:11:22,875
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

2180
02:11:22,962 --> 02:11:25,268
Even if I could, I mean,
honestly, what could we do
with that that's cool?

2181
02:11:25,355 --> 02:11:29,577
[scoffs] I don't know,
maybe command an army
of billions in the ocean.

2182
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:32,797
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's not that cool.
