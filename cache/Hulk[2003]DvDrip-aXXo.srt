1
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,231
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

2
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,150
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems...

3
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,819
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

4
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,737
Banner, I know
where you're going.

5
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,864
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

6
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:24,701
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

7
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,662
no human subjects.

8
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,808
David, I have wonderful news.

9
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,771
I'm gonna have a baby.

10
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:35,279
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?

11
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,740
Let's have a little fight.

12
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,075
You don't scare me.

13
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:45,163
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big
and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.

14
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,147
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

15
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,107
Bruce, you're hurt!

16
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:19,194
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

17
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:21,697
He just stood there, shaking.

18
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,698
It's okay.

19
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,290
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

20
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,708
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

21
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,335
That's Bruce. He's like that.

22
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,879
He's just so... bottled up.

23
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,802
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

24
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,720
You've ignored protocol.

25
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:50,390
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

26
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,350
That's my business.

27
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:56,228
Wrong, Banner.  It's government business,
and you're off the project.

28
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,167
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

29
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,753
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

30
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,421
Evacuate immediately!

31
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,714
I repeat, evacuate immediately!

32
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,026
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

33
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,154
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

34
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,074
What are you doing?

35
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,688
What are you doing?

36
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,566
I'm trying to tell you
what has to be done!

37
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,984
David, please stop it!
No!

38
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,866
No! No!
Yes!

39
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:43,285
David! No!

40
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,876
Bruce.

41
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,836
Bruce, wake up, son.

42
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,755
Bruce. Bruce.

43
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:02,344
Another nightmare?

44
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,804
I don't know.

45
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:06,890
I don't remember.

46
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,268
Hi, Mom.

47
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:14,438
Already off to college.

48
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,357
Gonna miss you terribly.

49
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,275
I'll miss you too.

50
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,277
Please, come here.

51
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,030
Look at you.

52
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,075
Soon to be a great scientist.

53
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,868
I guess.

54
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,828
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

55
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,915
There's something inside you...
so special.

56
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,793
Some kind of greatness.

57
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,878
I'm sure someday you're gonna...

58
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,255
share it with the whole world.

59
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:37,639
But as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

60
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,558
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

61
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:43,353
Security oughta be beefed up.  In a
place like this you can't be too careful

62
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,605
Bruce!  Big day.

63
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,524
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

64
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,860
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

65
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,946
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

66
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,116
You're implying something
about my helmet?

67
00:11:57,241 --> 00:12:00,077
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

68
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:04,247
Can I just ask... Were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

69
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,624
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

70
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,710
Go prep the samples.

71
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,005
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

72
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:18,260
I hate them.

73
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,512
-Wait, I just got here.  Who do we hate?
-The review board.

74
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:23,390
We have to make a
presentation on Tuesday.

75
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,475
And you're gonna make it with me.

76
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,602
You think I should?

77
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,021
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

78
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:35,025
You start talking about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate

79
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,446
I'm sorry.

80
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:41,490
That was rude.

81
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,909
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

82
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,078
us working together
after being... so close.

83
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,997
We were close?

84
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:51,332
Look, if I could be more...

85
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,085
whatever, you know...

86
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,254
- I'm... just...
- Don't.

87
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,590
It's not your fault, really.

88
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:01,508
You're just a by-product...

89
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,427
of my inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

90
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:06,429
I'll get over us.

91
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,307
Good for you.

92
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:12,184
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

93
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:16,230
If we don't get impressive results today,
we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

94
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,441
Well, then, let's go be impressive.

95
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,440
Harper?

96
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:06,234
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

97
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:12,698
Are we passing inspection?

98
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,075
Safeties all going green.

99
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,036
Countdown's started.

100
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,957
Nanomeds released.

101
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,835
Four seconds.

102
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,424
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

103
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,553
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

104
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,942
Gamma exposure.

105
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,612
Nanomeds now active.

106
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:01,284
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

107
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,245
It's working.

108
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:10,334
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

109
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,927
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

110
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:34,065
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em...

111
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,984
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

112
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,195
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

113
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,489
I mean, what if there's a plague?

114
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:45,116
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

115
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,036
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

116
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,455
frogs start falling from the sky,

117
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,707
who do they come to?

118
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,667
We'd be world-renowned.

119
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,835
Make any parents proud.

120
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,838
I bet they would be.

121
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,758
They actually did
want me to be a scientist.

122
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,802
I mean, your birth parents.

123
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,347
Guess we'll never know.

124
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:15,102
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

125
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:18,480
They're dead.  They died before
I can remember anything.

126
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,274
Why do you always
come back to this?

127
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,527
Don't know.

128
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,780
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

129
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,782
I guess there couldn't be any less

130
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,828
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

131
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,788
Nice work, Betty.

132
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,510
Betty.

133
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,179
- Glen.
- Hey.

134
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,139
Hi.

135
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,141
Hi.

136
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,602
What happened
to your uniform?

137
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.

138
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,148
I'm still working with your father, but...

139
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,693
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting
out all the most interesting work, and...

140
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,071
Can't argue with a paycheck.

141
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,949
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

142
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,867
Oh.

143
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:20,537
Hey, you're uh...

144
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,539
you're looking good.

145
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,421
You're the genetics expert.

146
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,017
Ah, the good old college days.

147
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,270
So, how's business?

148
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,065
What do you want?

149
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,444
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

150
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:58,322
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here

151
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:02,117
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

152
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:05,036
How would you like to
come work for Atheon?

153
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,914
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

154
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,583
and own a piece of the patents.

155
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,253
You just have to say the word.

156
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:16,255
Two words: The door.

157
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,565
General?

158
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,692
Come in.

159
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:42,237
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

160
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,116
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base

161
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,410
Why isn't it
going through N.S.C.?

162
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:54,582
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

163
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,424
Hi. Sorry.

164
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:10,096
Hey, what happened to Benny?  Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

165
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,056
Benny's dead.

166
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,266
I'm the new guy.

167
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,268
Oh.

168
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,771
Good to meet you.
Same.

169
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,128
- Let's try another.

170
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,881
Mmm, no. Stay here.

171
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,966
I look tired anyway.

172
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,134
Yeah, but you look great.

173
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,555
What's the matter?

174
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:59,057
It's these dreams, Doctor.

175
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:02,269
I keep having them,
and they're terrible.

176
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,897
Tell me about your dream.

177
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,777
Well, it starts...

178
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,988
it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

179
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,949
It's this image I have...

180
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,701
from when I was
maybe two years old.

181
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,481
Do you think
it's just a dream?

182
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,733
No, I think it's something
that happened...

183
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:57,695
when I was living at a desert base
with my father.

184
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,572
Anyhow,

185
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:02,991
the dream goes on and...

186
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,826
suddenly I'm alone.

187
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,734
That's terrible.

188
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,111
You know I'd never hurt you.

189
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,102
Hey there.

190
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:22,105
What's your name, darlin'?

191
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:24,899
Eh? What's your name?

192
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,944
Okay.

193
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,946
It's okay.

194
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,836
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

195
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,922
Bruce, stay here!

196
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:39,745
"C... T... G...

197
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:42,914
A... G."

198
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,918
Bruce.

199
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:54,717
My Bruce.

200
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,144
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

201
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:08,062
What's he doing here?

202
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,772
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

203
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:12,692
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

204
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:16,612
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

205
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,490
So leave.

206
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,451
Hey, no worries.

207
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,543
Let me give you a little heads-up.

208
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:35,921
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

209
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:37,798
and hostile takeover.

210
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:41,676
I've done my homework.  The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

211
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,554
Think: Gls embedded with technology...

212
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:47,015
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield...

213
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:49,100
in our sole possession.

214
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,520
That's a hell of a business.

215
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:56,273
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone

216
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,694
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

217
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,532
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

218
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,494
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

219
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:33,015
About Glen, I, um...

220
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:35,643
There's nothing to talk about.

221
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,771
Okay.

222
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:43,650
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about him... I'll handle it.

223
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:47,862
How?

224
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,865
I'm gonna call my father,

225
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,868
ask him to exert some pressure.

226
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:57,162
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

227
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,081
Hmm.

228
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,999
Well...

229
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,585
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

230
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,920
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

231
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:08,756
I don't know.  Maybe you 
anna come take a look at it

232
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,050
Okay, I'll be right there.

233
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,183
Aah!

234
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:39,701
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

235
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:44,247
Harper, get out!

236
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:46,875
Get out!

237
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,441
How's Harper?

238
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,359
He's all right.

239
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,277
You saved him.

240
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:21,156
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

241
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:28,621
I don't understand
how this is possible.

242
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,499
You should be dead.

243
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,962
They worked... the nanomeds.

244
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,964
I mean, I feel great.

245
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:42,384
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

246
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:45,845
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

247
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:50,016
Are you sure
the doctor checked?

248
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,934
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

249
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:54,103
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

250
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:56,063
I'm a hundred percent.

251
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,982
More.

252
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,276
What do you mean?

253
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,195
Remember my bad knee?

254
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,530
Well, now it's my good knee.

255
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,991
Bruce, this isn't funny.

256
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:09,992
I was watching you.

257
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:15,331
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

258
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,916
Betty...

259
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,960
I'm sorry.

260
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:24,047
Really.

261
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,591
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

262
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:29,469
Yeah.

263
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,513
You should get some rest.

264
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,515
And I'm fine. Really.

265
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,726
I've never felt better.

266
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,617
Your name is not Krenzler.

267
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,869
It's Banner.

268
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,000
- What?
- Your name...

269
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,701
it's Banner.

270
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:51,402
Bruce Banner.

271
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:54,255
Bruce.

272
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:58,300
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

273
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,053
In the labs.
The late shift.

274
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:04,889
It keeps me close to you.

275
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:09,102
You always work so late yourself
with your friend Miss Ross.

276
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:12,355
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

277
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,860
You're not well.

278
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,570
You've had a terrible accident.

279
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:25,492
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

280
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,496
You're thinking
there's something inside.

281
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,791
Something different...

282
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,419
inexplicable.

283
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:41,673
I can help you understand,

284
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,675
if you'll let me.

285
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,220
If you'll...

286
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:50,139
forgive me.

287
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:58,480
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

288
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:01,775
So perhaps you should leave now.

289
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,693
I'll be fine.

290
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,612
You must know.

291
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,822
You may not want to believe it,

292
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:11,409
but I can see it in your eyes.

293
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,954
So much like your mother's.

294
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,624
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

295
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:22,627
But then, you're something else too,
aren't you?

296
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,879
My physical son,

297
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,383
but the child of my mind too.

298
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,301
No.

299
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,219
You're lying.

300
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,097
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

301
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:38,475
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

302
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,645
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

303
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,648
They put me away for 30 years.

304
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,025
Thirty years!

305
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,111
Away from you.

306
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,071
Away from our work.

307
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,115
But they couldn't keep me forever.

308
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,785
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

309
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,872
You see,

310
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:03,832
everything...

311
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:06,126
your extraordinary mind...

312
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,045
has been seeking all these years...

313
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:11,505
it's been inside you.

314
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,633
Now we will understand it.

315
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:17,052
We will harness it.

316
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:21,181
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

317
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:25,518
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome

318
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,062
Let me protect you from her.

319
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,606
No. Get out.

320
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,942
- Bruce...
- Get out!

321
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:34,861
Sit!

322
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,753
We're gonna have to
watch that temper of yours.

323
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,498
You sure you're okay?

324
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,458
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed

325
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:40,128
Got a message from my father.

326
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:42,047
He's coming to see me.

327
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,965
Your father?

328
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:45,633
When?

329
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,594
Lands in about an hour.

330
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:51,389
The funny thing is, he called me.

331
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:04,818
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

332
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,995
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

333
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:17,454
- You're welcome.  Sir?
- Thank you.

334
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:18,831
You're welcome.

335
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:30,466
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

336
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,551
It's about Glen, isn't it?

337
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,805
He's been snooping around my lab.

338
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,724
Glen noticed some things,

339
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:41,518
asked me to make some inquiries.

340
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,980
Are you here to...

341
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,940
question me?

342
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:48,483
No.

343
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:51,235
We've turned up
some surprising things.

344
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:55,864
This Krenzler you work with...

345
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:58,408
you know who he really is?

346
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,329
How much do you
actually know about him?

347
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,206
I think the question is,

348
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,917
what is it
that you know about him?

349
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:14,882
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right

350
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:17,968
You know,

351
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,929
I think I was hoping that...

352
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:23,557
maybe this time you just...

353
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:26,893
honestly wanted to see me again.

354
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:29,437
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

355
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,274
Yes. I do want to see you.

356
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:38,529
I really wishthat I
could believe you.

357
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,030
Everything...

358
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:29,450
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...

359
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:31,744
all these years,

360
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,413
it's been inside you.

361
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,390
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

362
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:57,351
Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

363
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:02,147
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

364
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,566
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.

365
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:09,028
My father... It's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.

366
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:12,073
- I was so impatient, like always.

367
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:14,909
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, l...

368
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,287
I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.

369
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,997
So, um, uh...

370
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,832
Call me. Okay?

371
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:23,667
Bye.

372
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:26,711
- Betty?

373
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,674
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

374
00:41:02,757 --> 00:41:05,010
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!

375
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,119
Watch out!

376
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,636
Edith?

377
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:39,555
David, what's going on?

378
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:42,682
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

379
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:15,629
My Bruce.

380
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:31,102
Bruce?

381
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:08,344
There was some sort of explosion.

382
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:10,805
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

383
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:14,475
I was worried about you.

384
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:16,935
Well, I'm okay.

385
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,647
What happened to you last night?

386
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,526
I had the most vivid dream.

387
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,571
It was like being born.

388
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:31,240
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

389
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:33,242
Screaming.

390
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:36,537
My heartbeat...

391
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,039
it was, like, boom...

392
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:40,999
boom...

393
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:45,587
boom.

394
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:52,468
Were you at the lab?

395
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,428
No.

396
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,639
But something...

397
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:01,810
And there was that man.

398
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:03,728
The one with the dogs.

399
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:05,688
Who?

400
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:09,650
That new janitor.

401
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:11,903
He said he was my father.

402
00:45:16,824 --> 00:45:18,909
I'll get it.

403
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,628
My father.

404
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:41,847
My, my.

405
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:44,057
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

406
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:48,519
Krenzler.

407
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:53,816
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

408
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:57,486
Mitchell.

409
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,238
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

410
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:03,617
I'd rather stay here.

411
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,077
Now, Betty.

412
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,247
It's okay.

413
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:11,165
I'll be fine.

414
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:24,177
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

415
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:34,186
- What?
- Your friend in there.

416
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:37,815
There's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business.

417
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:39,733
Unfinished business.

418
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:42,777
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

419
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:45,655
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

420
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:48,533
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

421
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:50,910
And for the next
few days at least,

422
00:46:50,993 --> 00:46:52,787
you're gonna stay away from here.

423
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,788
For your own good.

424
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:06,382
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

425
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,302
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

426
00:47:25,984 --> 00:47:27,902
Dr. Ross.

427
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:30,780
How unexpected.

428
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:32,782
Please come in.

429
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:41,373
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

430
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:43,416
Uh...

431
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:48,588
I came to ask you something that...

432
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:52,258
I really have no business asking

433
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:56,095
He told you?

434
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:58,097
He said you talked to him.

435
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,057
Oh.

436
00:48:00,098 --> 00:48:02,017
Please sit down.

437
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:13,736
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

438
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:16,572
But he can't remember much about it

439
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,740
I need to find out what happened.

440
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,701
So, you want to know, uh,

441
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:22,702
what's wrong with him...

442
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,622
so you can fix him?

443
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:27,999
Cure him, change him.

444
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:32,253
My father's with the military.

445
00:48:32,336 --> 00:48:35,130
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security

446
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:37,049
Mmm.

447
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:40,344
Your father. Ross.

448
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:45,015
You brought your father
down upon his head?

449
00:48:45,098 --> 00:48:47,976
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

450
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:51,729
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

451
00:48:53,355 --> 00:48:55,524
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

452
00:48:55,608 --> 00:48:57,568
My son is...

453
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:00,821
unique.

454
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:02,739
That's why you can't relate to him.

455
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:07,243
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

456
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,162
Will they?

457
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,164
But you...

458
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:15,417
you try,

459
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,336
don't you?

460
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:19,338
Yes.

461
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:27,679
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

462
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:30,389
your attentions...

463
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:34,018
can't be completely unwanted.

464
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:36,395
Can they?

465
00:49:37,688 --> 00:49:39,856
No.

466
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:43,235
Not with eyes like yours,

467
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:46,070
watching expectantly,

468
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:49,073
lovingly.

469
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:54,286
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help him.

470
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,497
There's nothing
I can do for him...

471
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,582
or for you.

472
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,584
Besides,

473
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:04,379
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

474
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:06,297
His choice.

475
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:10,051
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

476
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:13,220
And don't worry about the dogs.

477
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:15,139
You'll be fine.

478
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:17,641
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

479
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,895
Good-bye.

480
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,150
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

481
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,027
What a coincidence.

482
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,946
So you're not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

483
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,115
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know

484
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,409
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

485
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,162
- Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.
- Let's cut the crap.

486
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,873
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like him,

487
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,426
and I'll do the same with you if I
feel so disposed. You understand?

488
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,837
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

489
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:53,799
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.

490
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:55,718
Don't play with me!

491
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:58,137
You were four years old
when you saw it.

492
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,555
When I saw what?

493
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:04,267
You were right there.  How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

494
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:07,270
What?

495
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:10,231
Oh, some more repressed memories.

496
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:15,110
Just tell me.

497
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,157
I'm sorry, son.

498
00:51:21,116 --> 00:51:24,536
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

499
00:51:25,495 --> 00:51:27,872
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

500
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:30,791
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site...

501
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,128
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

502
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,047
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting than...

503
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:40,467
trying to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

504
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,889
One more thing.

505
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,849
If you ever...

506
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:52,353
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

507
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:55,481
I'll put you away for the
rest of your natural life.

508
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:11,037
Dogs!

509
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,833
Go! Go get her!

510
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,794
And let nothing stand in your way!

511
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,046
Go!

512
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:24,396
Hello?

513
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:26,314
Bruce?

514
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:30,234
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

515
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,744
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

516
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:42,662
I got a visit today.

517
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:45,040
A very unwelcome visit.

518
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:47,542
I'm afraid my hand is being forced

519
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,670
What did you do to me?

520
00:53:50,753 --> 00:53:53,547
You so much want to know, don't you?

521
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:57,634
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

522
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:00,137
as the experience.

523
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,808
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

524
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:07,727
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

525
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:10,771
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

526
00:54:10,855 --> 00:54:13,649
So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

527
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:17,236
And passed on to me... what?

528
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,780
An alteration. Genetic.

529
00:54:19,863 --> 00:54:23,950
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

530
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:26,494
But an amazing strength too.

531
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:29,414
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

532
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:31,290
No.

533
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:33,209
You'll do no such thing.

534
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:35,669
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

535
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:39,006
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

536
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:41,800
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

537
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:44,969
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

538
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,473
I don't think so.

539
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:50,391
And as for Betty,

540
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:52,393
I'm sending her a surprise visit...

541
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:54,770
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

542
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:59,149
You see, I managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

543
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,818
and the results are tremendous.

544
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,488
They're unstable, but very powerful.

545
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:08,950
What about my DNA?

546
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:12,912
Let's just wait and see what Betty
makes of the results, huh?

547
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:14,830
No. You're crazy.

548
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:16,790
I won't let you.

549
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,337
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

550
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,589
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

551
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:26,508
Listen, my father's
going after Betty...

552
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,719
What makes you think you can go behind
my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

553
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:33,055
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

554
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:38,143
You pathetic freak.

555
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:40,520
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

556
00:55:40,562 --> 00:55:42,397
I can state the obvious.

557
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:45,650
Something tells me you aren't in much of a
position to be making stupid threats to anyone

558
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:52,406
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

559
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,283
You're making me angry.

560
00:55:54,366 --> 00:55:56,577
Oh, am I?

561
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,959
Ohh! Oh!

562
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:52,253
I got him! Open fire!

563
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,519
Bruce?

564
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:57,059
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

565
01:03:57,142 --> 01:03:59,436
But I killed them!

566
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,293
My God.

567
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:27,920
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

568
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:30,631
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

569
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,550
No. Deeper.

570
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:36,053
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

571
01:04:36,136 --> 01:04:38,555
Unleashed what?

572
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,516
Me.

573
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,185
It.

574
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:46,729
It's okay.

575
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:48,398
Shh. It's okay.

576
01:04:50,107 --> 01:04:52,693
What were those animals?

577
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:55,613
My father sent them.

578
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,323
He is my father.

579
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,409
He wanted me to change.

580
01:05:00,492 --> 01:05:03,662
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

581
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:05,789
Why would he want that?

582
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,333
Can you remember anything?

583
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,503
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

584
01:05:15,214 --> 01:05:18,008
It was like a dream.

585
01:05:18,091 --> 01:05:20,844
About what?

586
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:24,097
Rage.

587
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:27,392
Power.

588
01:05:28,935 --> 01:05:31,270
And freedom.

589
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,581
Hello? Sir.

590
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:54,875
- Hello.
- Dad?

591
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,211
Betty! Are you all right?

592
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:02,799
I'm scared.
I need your help.

593
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:04,801
Where are you?

594
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:17,020
How are you?

595
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:19,648
Okay, I guess.

596
01:06:23,151 --> 01:06:25,403
I think that somehow...

597
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:28,656
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

598
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:32,910
How could it?  We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

599
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,955
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

600
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:39,416
Like what?

601
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:44,421
Serious trauma.

602
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:48,216
Repressed memories.

603
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:58,100
Your father grilled me about something that
happened to me from early childhood...

604
01:06:58,142 --> 01:07:00,352
that I'm supposed to remember.

605
01:07:00,477 --> 01:07:01,853
He did?

606
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:06,733
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

607
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:12,196
The thing that worries me...

608
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:14,198
is...

609
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,283
a physical wound is finite,

610
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:18,202
but with emotions,

611
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,913
what's to say it won't
just go on and on...

612
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,375
and start a chain reaction?

613
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,962
You know what scares me the most?

614
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,758
When it happens,

615
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,927
when it comes over me...

616
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,930
and I totally lose control,

617
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,600
I like it.

618
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:02,617
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

619
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:06,287
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

620
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:08,122
Target down.
Target secure.

621
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:10,917
I'm going to take you someplace safe

622
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,086
Okay? Bruce?

623
01:08:14,128 --> 01:08:16,505
Bruce?

624
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:18,465
Bruce?

625
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,186
Clear!

626
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:00,238
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

627
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:10,581
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

628
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:13,000
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

629
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:15,210
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

630
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:18,088
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

631
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:22,259
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want

632
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,179
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

633
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:29,682
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings...

634
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:31,058
in a populated area.

635
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,604
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

636
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:38,482
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

637
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:40,734
I'm indebted to him for that.

638
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:44,195
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

639
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:48,366
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

640
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:52,078
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

641
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:56,165
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

642
01:11:56,206 --> 01:11:58,667
He says he doesn't know his father

643
01:11:58,709 --> 01:12:03,922
but he's workin'in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

644
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:08,134
So either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

645
01:12:08,176 --> 01:12:10,136
What?

646
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:13,848
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

647
01:12:15,224 --> 01:12:18,060
I was gonna say "damned."

648
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:20,562
Of course you were.

649
01:12:20,604 --> 01:12:21,980
But I'm a scientist.

650
01:12:22,063 --> 01:12:26,401
As a scientist, I believe we can figure
this out and he can be helped.

651
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,654
I know you do.

652
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,032
Look, whether you know or care,

653
01:12:33,074 --> 01:12:36,493
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

654
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:39,454
But this is too big for you.

655
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:43,333
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

656
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:45,919
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

657
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,254
They can probe and prod
all they want,

658
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:50,506
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

659
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,801
Nobody knows him better than I do

660
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:59,264
What did David Banner do to him?

661
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:04,853
Cover left!
Clear left.

662
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:06,771
Cover right!

663
01:15:12,094 --> 01:15:14,889
What's happening here?

664
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:17,349
My hand.

665
01:15:18,725 --> 01:15:22,771
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA...

666
01:15:22,854 --> 01:15:26,983
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

667
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,197
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

668
01:15:34,907 --> 01:15:37,326
Gonna have to ask you to...

669
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:40,287
put your hands up, pal, okay?

670
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,623
Nice and easy.

671
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,338
Do you really believe...

672
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:54,925
that I am separate from you?

673
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,177
Whoa!

674
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,234
Where am I?

675
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:18,906
You're home.

676
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:33,502
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

677
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:38,882
I must have seen you or known you.

678
01:16:38,966 --> 01:16:41,676
If only I could remember.

679
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:16,834
This is my old house, isn't it?

680
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:55,869
Let's go.

681
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:59,414
Please try.

682
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:53,380
What is it?

683
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:55,382
Nothing.

684
01:18:55,424 --> 01:18:57,384
Really?

685
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:02,055
Damn it.

686
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:10,479
Okay, Betty...
what do you want to know?

687
01:19:13,691 --> 01:19:16,276
What was in that room?

688
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,330
What are you afraid that I'll see?

689
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:38,005
See? There's nothing.

690
01:19:38,088 --> 01:19:41,174
It's empty.

691
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,229
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?

692
01:19:55,271 --> 01:20:00,484
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.

693
01:20:00,525 --> 01:20:02,944
But you're head of the base.

694
01:20:02,986 --> 01:20:05,363
I thought you were in charge.

695
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:09,867
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

696
01:20:12,161 --> 01:20:15,956
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

697
01:20:17,332 --> 01:20:20,836
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people
that want in on this.

698
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:24,089
And money to be made...
lots of it.

699
01:20:28,885 --> 01:20:31,971
You know the worst part
about all this?

700
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:34,974
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

701
01:20:35,057 --> 01:20:39,061
I didn't give that boy a second thought;
he was just collateral damage.

702
01:20:39,102 --> 01:20:42,189
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

703
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:46,276
What can I do?

704
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:49,695
You can go home now.

705
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:54,617
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed...

706
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,328
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

707
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,039
Right.

708
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:42,202
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

709
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:44,496
What do you want?

710
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:46,831
That's a good question.

711
01:21:46,873 --> 01:21:51,460
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

712
01:21:51,502 --> 01:21:55,214
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

713
01:21:55,297 --> 01:21:58,383
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

714
01:21:58,467 --> 01:22:01,303
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

715
01:22:02,512 --> 01:22:05,014
Do you mind?

716
01:22:05,098 --> 01:22:07,183
I'll never let you.

717
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:09,727
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

718
01:22:12,146 --> 01:22:14,732
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?

719
01:22:14,815 --> 01:22:18,910
After all, you've only got me to play with now
that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley

720
01:22:19,152 --> 01:22:20,696
You're lying.

721
01:22:20,737 --> 01:22:23,031
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

722
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:25,408
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you...

723
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,201
and I perform the autopsy.

724
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:30,288
You don't...

725
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:32,164
And I mop the floor with you...

726
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:35,084
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

727
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:39,254
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

728
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:45,009
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

729
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,553
Never.

730
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:55,185
You know, consciously
you may control it,

731
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:58,772
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

732
01:23:28,174 --> 01:23:31,135
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

733
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,647
Bruce.

734
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:58,493
- My dear Miss Ross.

735
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,370
Welcome back.

736
01:24:00,454 --> 01:24:02,998
There are two guards
right outside.

737
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:08,002
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

738
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:10,254
What do you want?

739
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:13,382
It's over for me now.
I know that.

740
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:16,927
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

741
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,346
That's why I've come to you...

742
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:23,475
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

743
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,186
as a man, as a father himself,

744
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:30,731
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully...

745
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:34,193
and before
he puts me away forever,

746
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,987
that he would let me see my son...

747
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:39,531
for one last time.

748
01:24:39,573 --> 01:24:42,284
Could you do that for me?

749
01:24:44,703 --> 01:24:47,330
It's out of my father's hands now.

750
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:54,962
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

751
01:24:56,213 --> 01:24:58,423
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

752
01:24:58,465 --> 01:25:02,093
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

753
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:05,722
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

754
01:25:05,805 --> 01:25:10,935
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

755
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:13,229
Myself! Not him!

756
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:16,732
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

757
01:25:16,815 --> 01:25:19,651
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

758
01:25:19,735 --> 01:25:22,571
It's the only path to the truth...

759
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:26,491
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

760
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:31,662
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

761
01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:34,665
All you've given Bruce is fear.

762
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:39,503
Fear of life.

763
01:25:41,588 --> 01:25:43,423
Fear?

764
01:25:44,799 --> 01:25:46,676
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

765
01:25:48,636 --> 01:25:50,972
And loneliness too.

766
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:55,643
Yes... I feel them both.

767
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:03,692
But I have lived...
completely once.

768
01:26:05,902 --> 01:26:08,488
I was so much in love,

769
01:26:08,529 --> 01:26:11,407
and she so much wanted a baby.

770
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:13,325
My baby.

771
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:23,418
I could tell
from the moment she conceived...

772
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:26,379
that it wasn't a son
I had given her...

773
01:26:26,462 --> 01:26:28,631
but something else.

774
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:31,008
A monster, maybe.

775
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:33,719
I should have put a stop to it
right then,

776
01:26:33,803 --> 01:26:38,056
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

777
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:41,935
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

778
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,146
I began to imagine the horror of it,

779
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:49,358
and my curiosity was replaced...

780
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:52,319
with compassion.

781
01:26:54,572 --> 01:26:57,116
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

782
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,409
Your father threw me out.

783
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:02,829
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well...

784
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:05,582
every moment, every sensation...

785
01:27:05,665 --> 01:27:07,834
walking into the house,

786
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:11,003
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

787
01:27:11,045 --> 01:27:15,883
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

788
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:18,844
David, please stop it! No!

789
01:27:18,927 --> 01:27:21,263
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!

790
01:27:21,346 --> 01:27:24,140
But then she surprised me.

791
01:27:24,182 --> 01:27:27,810
- No! No!

792
01:27:27,894 --> 01:27:29,854
David, no!

793
01:27:29,896 --> 01:27:32,940
It was as if...

794
01:27:33,065 --> 01:27:36,318
she and the knife...

795
01:27:36,402 --> 01:27:38,946
merged.

796
01:27:47,245 --> 01:27:49,330
No!

797
01:27:49,413 --> 01:27:51,999
You cannot imagine...

798
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:55,544
the unbearable finality of it.

799
01:27:55,628 --> 01:27:58,964
And in that one moment...

800
01:27:59,006 --> 01:28:03,093
I took everything that was dear to me...

801
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:07,305
and transformed it into nothing more...

802
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:09,307
than a memory.

803
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:27,282
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

804
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,871
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

805
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:40,669
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

806
01:28:40,752 --> 01:28:44,339
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

807
01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:02,105
-Should I neutralize?
-No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on

808
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:16,785
- All right, put him to sleep.

809
01:29:25,376 --> 01:29:27,545
It's not stopping him!

810
01:29:34,385 --> 01:29:36,762
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

811
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:39,473
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

812
01:29:39,556 --> 01:29:41,683
I must have a sample of him.

813
01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:43,601
Sir!

814
01:29:45,186 --> 01:29:48,564
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

815
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:50,441
Deploy containment foam.

816
01:29:51,484 --> 01:29:53,360
Talbot, talk to me.

817
01:29:54,862 --> 01:29:58,156
Under control, General. I'll let
you know if we need you.

818
01:29:58,198 --> 01:30:00,742
Unacceptable.  Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

819
01:30:00,784 --> 01:30:02,827
I want a full-court evacuation now.

820
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:05,246
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.

821
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:07,957
-Didn't you hear what the general said?
-I said lockdown!

822
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:12,920
Clear! I need a sample of him!

823
01:30:14,838 --> 01:30:18,050
Take it easy there, buddy.

824
01:30:18,175 --> 01:30:21,803
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

825
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,650
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

826
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:40,153
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.

827
01:30:40,237 --> 01:30:42,531
Clear!

828
01:30:51,998 --> 01:30:55,000
Lockdown the entire facility immediately

829
01:30:59,046 --> 01:31:01,923
Target's still moving towards blue level

830
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:05,135
- Evacuate the main hall.

831
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:12,767
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

832
01:31:12,808 --> 01:31:15,436
Set firing lines left and right!

833
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:18,063
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

834
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:41,084
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

835
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:43,253
Data's on backup power supply.

836
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:52,011
Incoming!

837
01:31:58,475 --> 01:32:01,061
-Shut down all power to the main hall
-Sir?

838
01:32:01,103 --> 01:32:05,565
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

839
01:34:08,845 --> 01:34:11,806
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

840
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,939
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

841
01:35:01,852 --> 01:35:03,687
Clear back! Clear back!

842
01:35:55,651 --> 01:35:59,696
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

843
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,656
Let's have it, General.

844
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,784
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

845
01:36:04,826 --> 01:36:09,413
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

846
01:36:09,455 --> 01:36:12,166
Angry Man is unsecure.

847
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:16,420
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

848
01:36:16,503 --> 01:36:19,881
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

849
01:36:19,965 --> 01:36:22,133
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

850
01:36:22,217 --> 01:36:24,344
Consider it done.  Keep us posted.

851
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,805
Contact Goodman Control.

852
01:37:12,888 --> 01:37:15,266
Patch data to the assets.

853
01:37:15,349 --> 01:37:18,060
Contact H.Q.

854
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:21,771
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation...

855
01:37:21,855 --> 01:37:26,818
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216...

856
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:01,600
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

857
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:04,060
Confirm area cleared.

858
01:38:04,102 --> 01:38:06,938
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.

859
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,148
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

860
01:38:09,232 --> 01:38:12,526
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

861
01:39:00,112 --> 01:39:01,947
Jesus.

862
01:39:16,502 --> 01:39:19,838
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

863
01:39:25,468 --> 01:39:29,472
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.

864
01:39:29,555 --> 01:39:33,559
We're okay, but, damn it, get him
off us before he tears us apart!

865
01:39:33,642 --> 01:39:36,186
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?

866
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,438
Watch it, Tango Flight.

867
01:39:38,438 --> 01:39:40,774
Break left! Break left!

868
01:39:40,816 --> 01:39:44,152
Tango Three, pull back and set up
for a Hellfire shot.

869
01:39:44,194 --> 01:39:46,571
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

870
01:39:46,654 --> 01:39:48,823
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

871
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:51,409
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.

872
01:39:55,245 --> 01:39:59,207
Engage at will.

873
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:20,435
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!

874
01:40:20,435 --> 01:40:23,313
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

875
01:40:23,355 --> 01:40:27,734
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.

876
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:48,211
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.

877
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:50,630
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

878
01:40:52,465 --> 01:40:54,383
Mayday! Mayday!

879
01:40:56,802 --> 01:41:00,180
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!

880
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,226
Give me a head count.

881
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,354
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

882
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:11,982
Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.

883
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:15,486
Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?

884
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:18,530
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

885
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:21,533
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

886
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:43,553
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.

887
01:41:43,553 --> 01:41:46,222
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.

888
01:42:12,121 --> 01:42:14,206
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.

889
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:17,793
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

890
01:42:17,793 --> 01:42:19,670
Damn!

891
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:22,088
I've got it.

892
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:24,215
It appears he's heading home.

893
01:42:24,299 --> 01:42:26,134
Launch fast movers.

894
01:42:26,217 --> 01:42:29,679
Have them intercept and engage.

895
01:42:29,762 --> 01:42:31,847
Hello?

896
01:42:31,889 --> 01:42:35,392
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way...

897
01:42:35,476 --> 01:42:37,102
and probably right for you.

898
01:42:37,186 --> 01:42:39,396
How far from the base are you?

899
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:42,482
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

900
01:42:42,566 --> 01:42:46,152
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

901
01:42:59,539 --> 01:43:02,334
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.

902
01:43:02,417 --> 01:43:06,337
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

903
01:43:06,379 --> 01:43:09,549
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

904
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:17,473
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

905
01:43:21,143 --> 01:43:24,562
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

906
01:43:24,646 --> 01:43:28,524
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

907
01:43:36,365 --> 01:43:39,534
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

908
01:43:39,618 --> 01:43:42,412
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

909
01:43:42,495 --> 01:43:44,497
Initiating afterburner.

910
01:44:01,304 --> 01:44:03,264
I'm passing flight level 600.

911
01:44:03,348 --> 01:44:05,475
This is out of my envelope.

912
01:44:05,558 --> 01:44:07,435
Hang in there, Legend.

913
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,855
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

914
01:44:10,896 --> 01:44:12,982
He'll lose consciousness before you.

915
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:21,823
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

916
01:45:06,364 --> 01:45:08,741
Puny human.

917
01:45:18,458 --> 01:45:20,335
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

918
01:45:20,419 --> 01:45:22,671
Let's not take any chances.

919
01:45:22,754 --> 01:45:26,049
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

920
01:45:46,192 --> 01:45:48,152
- Dad?
- Betty?

921
01:45:48,236 --> 01:45:50,571
We don't have a choice.

922
01:45:50,696 --> 01:45:52,907
I have to destroy him.

923
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:56,910
But you can't.  You will only fuel
his rage, and you will make him stronger

924
01:45:56,994 --> 01:46:01,248
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

925
01:46:02,374 --> 01:46:04,793
Then let me go to him.

926
01:46:04,834 --> 01:46:06,753
Please.

927
01:46:08,171 --> 01:46:10,798
Just give him a chance to calm down

928
01:46:34,278 --> 01:46:37,948
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

929
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:41,701
All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.

930
01:47:21,071 --> 01:47:23,573
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

931
01:47:23,657 --> 01:47:26,075
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.

932
01:47:26,117 --> 01:47:28,745
Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.

933
01:47:28,828 --> 01:47:32,039
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

934
01:47:41,131 --> 01:47:43,049
All units, hold your fire.

935
01:47:43,133 --> 01:47:46,344
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

936
01:47:46,469 --> 01:47:48,846
I repeat, hold your fire.

937
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:51,098
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.

938
01:48:04,652 --> 01:48:06,571
Go go, go, go, go, go!

939
01:48:35,347 --> 01:48:38,183
Hold your fire until my command!

940
01:48:40,644 --> 01:48:43,063
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

941
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:50,208
You found me.

942
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,253
You weren't that hard to find.

943
01:49:55,754 --> 01:49:57,673
Yes, I was.

944
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,357
Let's take a walk.

945
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,929
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base...

946
01:51:36,013 --> 01:51:40,183
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of him.

947
01:51:40,225 --> 01:51:44,979
In the meantime, ifhe does
anything but sit there in that chair,

948
01:51:45,063 --> 01:51:49,775
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

949
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:52,153
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.

950
01:51:52,236 --> 01:51:56,323
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

951
01:51:56,407 --> 01:51:59,117
Here they come!

952
01:52:04,956 --> 01:52:07,333
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

953
01:52:07,417 --> 01:52:11,212
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

954
01:53:56,016 --> 01:53:58,018
I should have killed you.

955
01:53:59,102 --> 01:54:01,605
And I should have killed you.

956
01:54:02,772 --> 01:54:05,024
I wish you had.

957
01:54:09,529 --> 01:54:11,781
I saw her last night.

958
01:54:13,866 --> 01:54:16,201
Saw her face.

959
01:54:16,243 --> 01:54:18,287
Brown hair.

960
01:54:19,996 --> 01:54:22,415
Brown eyes.

961
01:54:22,499 --> 01:54:25,210
She smiled at me.

962
01:54:25,293 --> 01:54:28,838
She reached down and kissed my cheek

963
01:54:30,131 --> 01:54:33,300
I can almost remember a smell.

964
01:54:36,303 --> 01:54:39,181
Almost like desert flowers.

965
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,642
Her favorite perfume.

966
01:54:45,353 --> 01:54:49,315
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

967
01:54:56,947 --> 01:55:00,617
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

968
01:55:07,457 --> 01:55:10,126
Go ahead and cry.

969
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,297
Cry. Crying will do you good.

970
01:55:15,422 --> 01:55:18,091
Don't touch me!

971
01:55:19,426 --> 01:55:22,137
Maybe once you were my father,

972
01:55:22,178 --> 01:55:24,806
but you're not now
and you never will be.

973
01:55:24,889 --> 01:55:28,267
Oh, is that so?

974
01:55:28,351 --> 01:55:33,814
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

975
01:55:33,898 --> 01:55:36,859
I came here to see my son.

976
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:40,153
My real son.

977
01:55:40,237 --> 01:55:42,656
The one inside of you.

978
01:55:42,697 --> 01:55:46,618
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

979
01:55:46,701 --> 01:55:48,744
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

980
01:55:48,828 --> 01:55:52,581
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

981
01:55:52,623 --> 01:55:55,876
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

982
01:56:01,214 --> 01:56:04,509
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

983
01:56:04,592 --> 01:56:06,844
For me.

984
01:56:06,928 --> 01:56:10,056
My cells can transform too,

985
01:56:10,056 --> 01:56:12,850
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

986
01:56:12,975 --> 01:56:15,644
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

987
01:56:15,728 --> 01:56:18,855
Son, I need your strength.

988
01:56:18,939 --> 01:56:22,025
I gave you life.

989
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:25,862
Now you must give it back to me!

990
01:56:25,904 --> 01:56:30,908
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

991
01:56:30,992 --> 01:56:34,245
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

992
01:56:34,328 --> 01:56:36,955
Stop what?

993
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:41,168
Think about all those men out there
in their uniforms...

994
01:56:41,293 --> 01:56:44,587
barking and swallowing orders,

995
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:47,924
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

996
01:56:48,007 --> 01:56:51,093
Think of all the harm they've done!

997
01:56:51,177 --> 01:56:54,054
To you! To me!

998
01:56:54,138 --> 01:56:56,265
To humanity!

999
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:59,226
And know this...
that we can make them...

1000
01:56:59,309 --> 01:57:01,811
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments...

1001
01:57:01,853 --> 01:57:04,439
disappear in a flash!

1002
01:57:04,481 --> 01:57:06,566
You in me.

1003
01:57:06,608 --> 01:57:08,776
I'd rather die.

1004
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:13,197
Oh, that's your answer?

1005
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:17,409
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn...

1006
01:57:17,493 --> 01:57:20,745
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth...

1007
01:57:20,829 --> 01:57:24,416
long before the pale religions
of civilization...

1008
01:57:24,499 --> 01:57:27,585
infected humanity's soul!

1009
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:30,671
Go!

1010
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,394
Stop your bawling,

1011
01:57:46,436 --> 01:57:49,730
you weak little speck
of human trash.

1012
01:57:55,903 --> 01:57:58,739
All right... I'll go!

1013
01:58:00,407 --> 01:58:02,951
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

1014
01:58:26,598 --> 01:58:29,559
- Hit it again!

1015
01:58:29,642 --> 01:58:33,270
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some
kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1016
01:58:37,774 --> 01:58:40,110
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!

1017
01:58:40,193 --> 01:58:43,363
Move, move, move!

1018
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,200
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

1019
01:59:33,284 --> 01:59:35,577
Call up the task force.

1020
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:44,210
Yes!

1021
02:00:46,017 --> 02:00:48,770
That's right. Keep fighting.

1022
02:00:48,853 --> 02:00:53,190
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

1023
02:01:00,447 --> 02:01:05,201
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal
drop in temperatures there.

1024
02:01:05,243 --> 02:01:07,662
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1025
02:01:07,787 --> 02:01:10,831
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

1026
02:01:19,798 --> 02:01:23,802
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1027
02:01:23,843 --> 02:01:28,598
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

1028
02:01:30,349 --> 02:01:34,186
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1029
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:37,814
Take it all!

1030
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:42,736
Oh, yes! Yes!

1031
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:58,834
Take it back!

1032
02:01:58,875 --> 02:02:02,545
It's not stopping!

1033
02:02:02,629 --> 02:02:04,798
Take it back!

1034
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:22,939
Gentlemen... release.

1035
02:02:30,988 --> 02:02:33,866
Gamma charge away.

1036
02:02:54,426 --> 02:02:57,721
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

1037
02:03:49,185 --> 02:03:52,021
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

1038
02:03:52,021 --> 02:03:54,481
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1039
02:03:54,565 --> 02:03:57,401
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

1040
02:03:58,986 --> 02:04:02,656
Look, Betty... you and l...

1041
02:04:02,697 --> 02:04:07,702
well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

1042
02:04:07,785 --> 02:04:11,747
But... well, you know...

1043
02:04:11,789 --> 02:04:14,667
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

1044
02:04:14,708 --> 02:04:18,128
The usual loonies.  Seein' things.

1045
02:04:18,211 --> 02:04:20,088
Only now everything's green.

1046
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:23,633
Right.

1047
02:04:23,675 --> 02:04:26,594
Look, uh...

1048
02:04:26,636 --> 02:04:30,097
if by some chance
he did survive...

1049
02:04:30,181 --> 02:04:34,602
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

1050
02:04:34,685 --> 02:04:37,187
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1051
02:04:38,313 --> 02:04:41,983
No... I wouldn't.

1052
02:04:42,025 --> 02:04:45,528
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1053
02:04:45,612 --> 02:04:48,948
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1054
02:04:49,031 --> 02:04:51,117
I'm under surveillance.

1055
02:04:53,202 --> 02:04:55,788
I'll tell you, though,

1056
02:04:55,829 --> 02:04:57,831
that if he were alive,

1057
02:04:57,873 --> 02:05:00,917
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to...

1058
02:05:01,001 --> 02:05:04,254
because... as much as I miss him,

1059
02:05:04,379 --> 02:05:08,257
I... I... loved him.

1060
02:05:08,299 --> 02:05:11,218
I, um...

1061
02:05:11,302 --> 02:05:14,513
Yeah.

1062
02:05:14,555 --> 02:05:16,807
I'm sorry, Betty.

1063
02:05:19,059 --> 02:05:21,561
I am so sorry.

1064
02:05:23,772 --> 02:05:25,899
I know you are.

1065
02:06:00,806 --> 02:06:02,641
Si.

1066
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:16,945
Let's take a walk.

1067
02:08:20,809 --> 02:08:24,020
<i># You operate and motivate
on synthetic fuel</i>

1068
