1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,400
That's lame of you, man! You just
betray us, whats up with that?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,800
- Hey! You forgot this on Friday.
- Forgot it where?

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,940
In the cafeteria.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,770
Who's that dude?

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,770
Did you know that me and Sonja have been
dating since she was 15 or something?

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,050
SATURDAY 11:47

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,620
<b>NOORA:</b> The <b>only</b> thing he does is work. And suddenly it kinda
seems like... like it's <b>money</b> that... matters most to him.

8
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:05,650
And, he basically... he becomes... He becomes
<i>totally</i> different when he's around his dad...

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,310
<b>PHONE:</b> Hey, thanks for yesterday.
Any plans for today?

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,880
<b>NOORA:</b> ...and those stockbroker colleagues.

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:24,280
<b>NOORA:</b> It's like, he so totally looks up to his dad. It's
like he's <i>glowing</i>... whenever his dad enters the room.

12
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:15,050
<b>PHONE:</b> Hey, thanks for yesterday. Any plans
for today? Still ready to do hang out?

13
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:35,450
I... I do understand that... because... he never
used to get sort of acknowledgement previously.

14
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,400
But... now that he's finally getting
that, he gets totally like...

15
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:53,370
- He becomes a child, sort of. But I... can't live that way.
- No.

16
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,340
Alone in... London.

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,680
Because... I left... to be with him, and
then now we never spend time together.

18
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah... Yeah, I mean, yeah,
I do understand that.

19
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,220
You know, to be honest, it hasn't been all easy for us
here at home either, I don't know, it's been kind of...

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,680
[Hey, thanks for yesterday,
what's the plan today?]

21
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,540
 There's been so much chaos, and... one week... I had to wipe
myself with Linn's menstrual pads, you know, it's totally...

22
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:40,850
And Isak, he is... he's a very nice boy,
but he's, like... he's so lazy, kind of.

23
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,000
Eskild! I'm sitting right here!

24
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:55,080
Yeah... You should be able to handle the fact that I'm happy to see Noora
again? No need to get all hurt and jealous... I love <i>you</i> just the same.

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,340
Jealous?! I'm not jealous!

26
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:07,110
But obviously we need to find a solution here, because if Noora
is gonna live here now, then we're four people in three rooms.

27
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,280
Are you serious?!

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,400
I mean, Noora comes home having been <i>dumped</i> by the love of
her life, and the only thing you think about is your room?

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,020
- Can't you sleep on the floor? Can't you...? Dear Lord...
- I haven't been <i>dumped</i>.

30
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,250
- No, you haven't been dumped, but...
- It was me who... uhm... who left him.

31
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,400
And it's not <i>over</i>. We have...

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,740
taken a break.

33
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:51,050
And if he... really loves me,
he <b>is</b> going to come after me.

34
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,280
You know, I think... I don't know, but...

35
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:09,850
People even leave their wives and kids just to be with the one they
love, and if he really loves you then of course he'll choose you.

36
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,560
I think it'll all work out. It's really
nice to have you back home anyway.

37
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,180
 [Yeah, thanks for yesterday, I hope that Noora girl is alright. I'd forgotten
that I had planned something with Sonja today, sorry, see you at school.]

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,450
Are you happy to be home again?
Are you gonna be home again?!

39
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,510
Did it taste good?

40
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,310
- Thanks.
- A pleasure.

41
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,540
- It was Linn who made it.
- Yes.

42
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,050
- I don't believe that at all!
- It's true!

43
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,130
That's why it doesn't taste any good.

44
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:01,940
{\b1</b> Blindern and Nissens
HALLOWEEN PARTY. Friday.

45
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,020
- Hey!
- Hi!

46
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,420
Are you going to that Halloween thing?

47
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,000
Uhm, no... Or... maybe. I dunno. Are you?

48
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,340
Wanna go?

49
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,000
- Okay!
- Okay?

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,570
- Yeah.
- Alright, then let's pre-drink together. -Yeah.

51
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,310
- Hey.
- Hi.

52
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,880
Did you do anything fun this weekend?

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Uhm, no...

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,570
I tried calling you on Friday...

55
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,370
Yeah, I saw that... but there was <b>so</b> much
shit going on this weekend... there was...

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,200
- Noora came home. Did you hear about that?
- Yes.

57
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,740
And I also heard that...
you hosted a pre-drink?

58
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,170
Yeah, yeah, I did. Well, actually,
I really didn't, but in a way...

59
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:47,170
So... It was Vilde who virtually forced me to host it. You know, she's
completely mad about all that theatre stuff, and then she talked to...

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,200
Eskild and all, so in the end I didn't really have a choice, but it wasn't
really like I hosted it. It was more like <b>she</b> hosted it at <b>my</b> place.

61
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,600
- But it was pretty... pretty fucking boring, man.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,340
- It's not like you missed anything.
- No...

63
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
So, it's Magnus' birthday on Saturday.

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,050
- Really?
- Yeah, so I and Mahdi are planning on doing something cool for him.

65
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,280
- Yes! I'm all in, man. Yeah. We
could arrange for his first fuck.

66
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,170
Yeah, that'll be damn funny. We better
call some of those dancer-chicks.

67
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,310
- Yeah!
- He liked those, apparantly.

68
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,110
Or Vilde!

69
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,970
- Yes, yes, yes, my God.
- He'll get to realize all his sado-dreams.

70
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,940
- Yeah, yeah, dominatrix, dominatrix.
- Yeah.

71
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,340
He's not sane. He's deranged.

72
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,800
...the original genes are thus passed down to the
next generation, when the offspring divides itself.

73
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:55,770
 Because transmission of genetic material can occur in three different
ways: Through conjugation, transformation and transduction.

74
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,910
[Mamma: Psalms 51:1]

75
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,970
Do you agree?

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,940
Can you concentrate?!

77
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,840
Sana. I have a question.

78
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,520
No offense, but why are
you actually religious?

79
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,720
It's 2016 and the world is progressing.

80
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,100
You are a smart girl and you study exact
sciences. Don't you get that it's nonsense?

81
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,540
Is something in my religion bothering you?

82
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,660
Nothing specific, just you believing there
is something right and something wrong.

83
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,820
And that there's a god who decides that
and who says homosexuality isn't right.

84
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,980
Or to eat hotdogs or whatever…

85
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,460
What is it you believe in Isak?

86
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,560
Me? I believe in science.
The theory of evolution. Nothing else.

87
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Okay.

88
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
So let's look at the theory of evolution.

89
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,660
How do you explain homosexuality
within natural selection?

90
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Hm?

91
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,400
Evolution wise homosexuality
is a genetic dead end.

92
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,200
Gay people don't progress the world.

93
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,860
So according to the theory of evolution, they should
have already been extinct millions of years ago.

94
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,000
Unless homosexuality is not
genetic, but rather a disease.

95
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,760
Or a choice people make.

96
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,860
What do you think about that?

97
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,320
I don't fucking know. I don't go around
thinking about homosexuality all the time.

98
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
No.

99
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
So since you don't have the
answer to everything...

100
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,140
can't we just agree that there's a lot between
heaven and earth that none of us know about?

101
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,260
And instead of sitting here criticizing my religion, can't you just
respect that we have chosen different ways to understand life?

102
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,840
- Okay, whatever.
- Hey!

103
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,340
I talked so Sonja and she was wondering if
we could have the pre-drink at your place?

104
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Huh?

105
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,120
Sonja. Even's girlfriend.

106
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,380
Yeah?

107
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,020
She said you and Even planned a
pre-drink before the Halloween party.

108
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
With us.

109
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,620
- Yeah, hm-hm.
- Yeah! Cool.

110
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,800
Sonja and Even will dress
up as God and an angel.

111
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,900
So I thought it'd be awesome
if we matched as well.

112
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,280
If we dress up as a cat and a mouse,
or Batman and Batwoman or something?

113
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
If you think that's fun?
Only if you think it's fun.

114
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,980
But I'll text you.

115
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Hello?

116
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,500
What is it? Shit.

117
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,280
Moving on to 10:3, sexual reproduction.

118
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,820
Or was that what you just talked about?

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,660
No? Okay.

120
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,880
Should I read it out loud? Do some work...

121
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:22,680
Sexual reproduction is when offspring is created by two haploid
reproductive cells merging and forming a diploid zygote.

122
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,220
Sounds easy!

123
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,980
Now that I'm not going to school,
I don't really know what to do.

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,820
I miss having something to <b>do</b>.

125
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,980
What do you miss most?

126
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,560
Having something to do during the day.

127
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm pretty bored.

128
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,240
I've thought about that as well.
We've gone to school for 10 years.

129
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,760
But just going to school.
Being in the theatre for example.

130
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,130
Are you with the theatre?

131
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,400
- Yes! I don't understand
people who don't want to join.

132
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,900
- It's a bit weird.
- It's really weird.

133
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,740
- Were you in it?
- Yes, all three years.

134
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,300
- All three years?
- Yeah, I'm three years older than you.

135
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you from '97? No!

136
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,360
It's really nice.
Despite the age difference.

137
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,880
I mean, not that you didn't
seem like a '97, but hey!

138
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,460
It's so nice talking to
you, I didn't notice...

139
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,500
- Yeah, same for me!

140
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
Didn't think of the age difference.

141
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,240
Are you one year older than Even?

142
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,980
No, I'm from '97 too.

143
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,320
Can you please calm
down a little with the beer?

144
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,140
Can you stop watching over me?

145
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,140
I mean it, stop monitoring me.

146
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,860
- Where's the toilet?
- In the corridor, on your right.

147
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,400
I heard a lot of people
are coming to the party.

148
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,560
- What time is it?

149
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
- Hm?
- What time is it?

150
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,620
21:21

151
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Seriously?

152
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,040
Yeah, why?

153
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,640
We're going.

154
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Where?

155
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Wherever.

156
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,540
Hurry up!

157
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,840
I feel like swimming.
Don't you?

158
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,420
- Swimming?
- Yeah!

159
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,800
- Who lives here?
- My aunt.

160
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,280
- And she's okay with us being here?
- Of course. Not a problem.

161
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,850
But... where is your aunt?

162
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
She's on holiday.

163
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
So why don't you have the keys then?

164
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,800
Because she's on <b>holiday</b>.

165
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,920
- That's the answer to everything.
- Relax! Don't worry.

166
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
You coming?

167
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Okay!

168
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,860
Why are you so skeptical?

169
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,210
I'm not skeptical, but it <b>is</b> a
bit that weird we're going to...

170
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,120
- Are you scared of swimming?

171
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,540
- Scared of swimming?
- Yeah.

172
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,620
- Do you have a fear of water?
- Fear of water?!

173
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,120
- Fear of water, yes.
- Wow!

174
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,960
It isn't my aunt's house.

175
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,180
So you're just scared to fuck up your hair?

176
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,960
- You think I care about my hair?
- What should I think?

177
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,380
- It looks like it.
- Does it look like I care about my hair?

178
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Not right now, but usually it does.

179
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,480
- You thought I died?
- Yeah I got so scared.

180
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,480
- You suck at holding your breath?
- I suck? Try it yourself.

181
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,300
Are you challenging me?

182
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,980
- I'm the master at holding my breath.
- Show me.

183
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Okay fine.

184
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Wow!

185
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,900
- You never cease to impress.
- I got water in my lungs.

186
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,160
- Yeah right!
- I swallowed water!

187
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
- Okay!
- I'll try again.

188
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
- Now together.
- Together?

189
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
- On three?
- Last one to come up wins.

190
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
- Ready?
- We're going together on three.

191
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,780
No, on 1.
3, 2, 1!

192
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,340
- Yes!
- Yes what?

193
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,060
I won!

194
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,780
- Huh?! Yes?!
- I won! No! You're kidding, that's cheating!

195
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,500
What?!

196
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,560
Yes, that was cheating.

197
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
- You think there are rules here?
- Yes!

198
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
What did you think?

199
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,460
But that's just cheating!
You can't do that.

200
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,140
- I don't accept losing like that.
- Then let's do it again.

201
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,580
MOM!

202
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,280
- Fuck fuck fuck!
- Fucking hell!

203
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
Who the hell is she?!

204
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,340
Who lives here?

205
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,720
Someone I went to elementary school with.
