00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:04,937
<i>- In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>
<i>named vandal savage</i>

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Conquered the world</i>
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,609
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>
<i>to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,944
<i>And stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,946
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>my plan is opposed</i>

6
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,382
<i>By the body I'd sworn</i>
<i>my allegiance to:</i>

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,850
<i>The time masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,052
<i>In the future,</i>
<i>my friends may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,820
<i>But if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:25,491
<i>They will be</i>
<i>remembered as legends.</i>

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,727
<i>- Previously, on</i>
<i>"legends of tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,196
- The time masters
discourage marriage,

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:36,902
<i>But I fell in love</i>
<i>and we had a child, jonas.</i>

14
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,371
- Maybe we could get a drink?
- Are you asking me out?

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,873
- Yes. Is that okay?

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,474
- I think my life's
complicated enough

17
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,411
Without throwing
whatever this is into the mix.

18
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,680
- This is star city.
- Yes, star city, 2046.

19
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,482
- It's everything
we've ever wanted.

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,384
We could live like kings here.

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,020
[grunting]

22
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,422
You son of a bitch.

23
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,892
You lay a hand on me again,
you'll burn too.

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,195
<i>- Go ahead, jonas.</i>

25
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,297
<i>He's listening.</i>

26
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,332
<i>- Hi, daddy. We miss you.</i>

27
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,936
<i>- And love you.</i>
<i>- And love you.</i>

28
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,372
<i>- Anything else</i>

29
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,942
<i>- Come home soon, daddy.</i>

30
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,244

31
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,679
<i>Hi, rip.</i>

32
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,815
<i>Not sure if you got</i>
<i>our last message.</i>

33
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,583
<i>I told jonas that you got</i>
<i>caught up with work,</i>

34
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,154
<i>But I really thought</i>
<i>you'd be home by now.</i>

35
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,124
<i>London is--</i>

36
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,093
<i>Things have changed.</i>

37
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,661
<i>It's hard to tell</i>
<i>what's going on</i>

38
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:39,731
<i>With so many soldiers</i>
<i>and rumors.</i>

39
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,502
<i>I just want to know</i>
<i>you're all right.</i>

40
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,704
<i>Wherever you are,</i>

41
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,374
<i>Whenever you are,</i>

42
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,744
<i>I love you, rip.</i>

43
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,482
<i>Go ahead, jonas.</i>
<i>He's listening.</i>

44
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,684
<i>- Hi, daddy. We miss you.</i>

45
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,853
<i>- And love you.</i>
<i>- And love you.</i>

46
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,387
- I'm sorry
to interrupt, captain.

47
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,991
- No, uh, not at all.
Just, uh, catching up on work.

48
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,892
- What is all this?

49
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,193
- Just trying
to connect the dots,

50
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,930
Find the optimal time
to strike at savage.

51
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,198
- And?

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,766
- And the trail's gone cold.

53
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,735
In order to preserve
the element of surprise,

54
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,970
I wager the best
course of action

55
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,872
Is to travel
further back in time,

56
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,908
But nothing here indicates
where to find him.

57
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,543
- Perhaps I
can help you look.

58
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,813
- I've been looking!

59
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,481
I apologize.

60
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,650
It's just the stakes
are so high.

61
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,654
I vowed to save my family,
but I'm failing them.

62
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,159
Perhaps I'm not
the time master they need.

63
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,694
- You must be.

64
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,764
You're the only one they have.

65
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,900
Can't gideon help us?
- No.

66
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,701
When a timeship returns
to the vanishing point

67
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,603
After a mission,
its cpu is updated

68
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,804
From the temporal database,

69
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,975
Which, given my rogue status,

70
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,210
We are unable to do.

71
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,378
- So, what you're saying is

72
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,714
Gideon requires
a software update.

73
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,083
Which explains why you've been
holed up in here

74
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,185
For the past week.

75
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:10,055
- Has it really been a week?
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,659
And some of our teammates
are getting just a tad antsy.

77
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,228
- [screaming]

78
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,130
[grunts]
I'm done.

79
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,032
- Don't mind him.

80
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,501
He's still sore
about having to leave 2046.

81
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,770
- I'm sore because
I was recruited

82
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,172
For my unique ability
to light things on fire.

83
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,008
And now, I'm locked
in the one place

84
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,377
Where I can't light things
on fire:

85
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,712
A spaceship.

86
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,915
- Where do you think
you're going?

87
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,250
- Why?

88
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,886
You gonna clock me in the head
if I don't listen again?

89
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,626
- Everything okay with you two?

90
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,162
- Yeah, peachy.

91
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,797
<i>- Captain,</i>
<i>I've just intercepted</i>

92
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,298
<i>A deep space transmission.</i>

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,133
<i>It's a distress signal</i>
<i>from the acheron.</i>

94
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,602
<i>She's the--</i>
<i>- flagship of the time fleet.</i>

95
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,904
Yes, I know that.
Thank you, gideon.

96
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,706
<i>- Systemic malfunction.</i>

97
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,407
<i>I'm stranded, unable to jump.</i>

98
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,009
<i>Controls unresponsive.</i>

99
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,811
<i>This is captain eve baxter</i>

100
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,312
<i>Of the timeship acheron,</i>

101
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,649
<i>Requesting critical rescue.</i>

102
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,253
- And we care about
this chick why?

103
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,188
- We don't,
but the acheron's computer

104
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,458
Will contain the current intel
on savage's whereabouts.

105
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,093
Gideon, set a course

106
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,961
For the acheron's position
in deep space.

107
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,796
<i>- Yes, captain.</i>
<i>- Deep space?</i>

108
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,265
I had no idea we had the ability

109
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,001
To explore the unknown realms
of the galaxy.

110
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,569
Astonishing.
- No.

111
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,104
What's astonishing
is that we're acting

112
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,406
As roadside assistance
for the people who's chasing us.

113
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,974
- Doesn't it seem suspicious,

114
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,678
This distress call just
happened to reach us?

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,946
- How do we know
it's not a trap?

116
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,314
- We don't, but
what we do know

117
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,016
Is that savage's trail
has run cold.

118
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,684
And unless gideon
can upload the data

119
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,687
From the acheron's computer--
- I'm in.

120
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,888
- You are?

121
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,323
- The sooner we end savage,
the sooner

122
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,092
I get back to where I belong.
- Prison?

123
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,462
- Any prison on earth's
better than this one, professor.

124
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,332
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

125
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,800
- Engines to full throttle.

126
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,869
<i>- Of course, captain.</i>

127
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,072
<i>[exciting music]</i>

128
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:15,080
<i>â™ª</i>

129
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,094
- Professor stein,
mr. Jackson,

130
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,762
Would you care to join
the boarding party?

131
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,497
- A chance for an
extra-vehicular

132
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,800
Docking maneuver?
What could be more exciting?

133
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,134
- I could think of a few things.

134
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,671
- Let's get this thing started.

135
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,506
- Hey, you think
there's something

136
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,208
Worth stealing on that ship?

137
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,677
- I'm just looking
for a change of scenery.

138
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,647
If that's okay with you, boss.

139
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,115
- Dr. Palmer.

140
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,718
I leave the ship
in your hands while we're gone.

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,088
And I leave him in yours.

142
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:06,198
<i>â™ª</i>

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,233
- I'm having
the strangest sensation.

144
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,135
It's like I'm
ten years old again.

145
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,471
- You do a lot of space travel
as a kid, professor?

146
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,806
- Only in my dreams,
after I read

147
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,743
My first issue of
"rick starr: Space ranger."

148
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,612
- Space ranger stein?
Yeah, I don't see it.

149
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,048
- I wanted
to travel through space,

150
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,451
Surviving only by
my wits and laser guns.

151
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,855
I even built a rocket
out of cardboard boxes.

152
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,323
- What stopped you?

153
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,759
- Nasa has rather strict
guidelines regarding

154
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,827
Nearsightedness.
- And smoking weed.

155
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,562
- Gideon, have you been able
to link up

156
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,897
To the acheron's computer?

157
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,565
<i>- It appears</i>
<i>a self-destruct code</i>

158
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,934
<i>Has disabled the ship's</i>
<i>temporal navigation system.</i>

159
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,436
- Well, what does that mean?

160
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,872
- It's possibly the result
of a malfunction.

161
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,807
Just in case, martin,
I'm going to ask you

162
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,409
To remain behind here
on the jump ship.

163
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,277
- You're telling us
if something goes wrong,

164
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,712
Egghead's in charge?

165
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,180
- Break out the emergency gear.

166
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,650
Space ranger has a job to do.

167
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,853
<i>- Rip? Rip, I need an update.</i>

168
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,588
- How about this update?

169
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,224
They've boarded the ship!

170
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,995
We've been overrun!
- Excellent.

171
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,431
- Perhaps you're not
taking this seriously, miranda.

172
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,932
- Gary?
<i>- Yes, captain?</i>

173
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,734
- Be a dear and open the

00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,769
- Make sure picard here
doesn't get us all killed.

348
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,238
- Actually,
I'm more like sulu right now.

349
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,208
Or han solo!

[machinery whining,

353
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,024
I said fire!

354
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,260
- Sir, the weapons systems
have been taken offline.

355
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,829
Manually.
- Who else is on my ship?

356
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,132
- Oh, a good captain
keeps his best weapons hidden

357
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,600
From his enemies, mr. Valor.

358
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,969
- Find the saboteur!
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

359
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,837
I guess we'll just have
to follow your friends

360
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,205
Till they're out of air.

361
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,473
Shouldn't take too long,
given the size

362
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,075
Of the hole in the hull.

363
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,078

364
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,647
- Here.
[electricity whines]

365
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,785
- Hail the crew
of the waverider.

366
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,421
Rip, tell your crew
to let us board,

367
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,056
And I will happily save them.

368
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,559
But either way,
we are taking the waverider.

369
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,728
- Take the damn deal, rip.

370
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,931
- A captain never
surrenders his ship.

371
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,666
Besides, you'll never
catch captain palmer.

372
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,202
He once outran
kanjar ro himself.

373
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,837
- Who's kanjar ro?

374
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,605
<i>- Engaging protocol</i>

375
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,175

377
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,582
- What the hell
happened to 'em?

378
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,584
- We were following
a holographic projection

379
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,220
Which allowed the waverider
to slip away.

380
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,655
- Giving secret commands
to your crew.

381
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,290
Very clever, captain.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,492
- Throw them in the brig!

383
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,961
We'll find your friends' bodies.

384
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,863
Eventually.

385
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,665
- How long
can you keep that up for?

386
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,632
- Not long.

387
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,203
I'm gonna run out of charge.

388
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>- Be advised, the breach</i>
<i>is only partially contained.</i>

389
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,711
- Guess we know
the bulkhead doors are working.

390
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,748
- Too bad we're on
the wrong side of them.

395
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,664
Just hang tight.
- Is there another option?

396
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,799
- Don't mean
to rush you, raymond,

397
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,267
But it's getting cold in here.

398
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,802
Normally I
wouldn't complain, but--

399
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,203
- Can't you just open
the doors, gideon?

400
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,272
<i>- The bulkhead is designed</i>

00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,475

00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,977

404
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,845
- We're dead?

405
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,749

00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,785
Ah...

407
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,488
Captain baxter.
I'm rip hunter.

408
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,856
I'm here to rescue you.

409
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,726
- I doubt it.
You walked straight into a trap.

410
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,027
- I will admit
that we've encountered

411
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,330
Some...Unforeseen obstacles.

412
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,765
- Right.

413
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,467
- But, we're gonna get you
out of here in a second.

414
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,835
Mr. Jackson, will you please see
what we can do

415
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,503
About disabling
this force field?

416
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,073
- You don't think
I've tried that?

417
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,341
But by all means,
if you think this <i>kid</i>

418
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,843
Will have better luck.

419
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,045
- Whoa, who you callin' kid?
- I'm sorry.

420
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,481
I meant criminal.
- Actually, that's me.

421
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,683
- All of you.
If we ever do get out of here,

422
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,984
The first thing I'll do
is take you

423
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,453
To the vanishing point
to await trial

424
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,455
Before the time council.

425
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,324
The great rip hunter,

426
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,425
But look at you now.

427
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,827
- Yes, look at me now.

428
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,628
Helping you break out
of a pirate's brig

429
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,197
Aboard your own timeship.

430
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,199
- I don't want help from a man
who broke his oath,

431
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,235
Stole a timeship, and decided
to change history

432
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,805
For his own selfish reasons.

433
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,408
Doesn't make any sense to me.

434
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,945
- No, I don't expect it would.

435
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,415
- Rip hunter.

436
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,418
Miranda coburn.

437
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,887
Those aren't
your real names, are they?

438
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,355
- No, sir.

439
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,225
- And why is that?

440
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,627
- Because if our enemies knew
our true identities,

441
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,729
Our ancestors and descendants
across the timeline

442
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,397
Could be potential targets.

443
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,000
- As well as
anyone else you might love.

444
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,168
Which is why...

445
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,836
- Personal attachments
are expressly forbidden

446
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,371
By the council of time masters.

447
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:04,008
- And grounds for immediate
discharge from service.

448
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,077
Do either of you deny
that you were conducting

449
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,248
An illicit affair in violation
of this council's rules?

450
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,651
In that case,

451
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,853
I motion that we adjourn
this disciplinary hearing

452
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,156
For one hour to afford you

453
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,626
The opportunity
to consider your response.

454
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,761
Though I sincerely doubt
there's any answer

455
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,064
You can provide that will
prevent this tribunal

456
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:31,135
From discharging you
both from the time masters.

457
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,380
- I suppose this feels like
a day at the beach for you?

458
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,614
- If I had to pick
a way to die,

459
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,751
Freezing wouldn't be the worst.

460
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,453
What's it like?

461
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,155
Dying?

462
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,492
I imagine you've got
a unique perspective.

463
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,894
- You know, it's funny.

464
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,331
I mean, you'd expect
it to be terrifying,

465
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,302
Just panic and fear.

466
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,305
- What'd you feel?

467
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,076
- I guess lonely.

468
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,045
Yeah.

469
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,082
Like everybody I loved
was a million miles away.

470
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,988
I mean, I don't like you, but at
least I'm not dying alone.

471
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,627
- Closest I ever came to dying
was, uh...

472
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,929
The day I met mick.

473
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,600
- Why does that not surprise me?
- It wasn't like that.

474
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,934
It was my first day in juvie.

475
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,738
I was 14, and the smallest kid
in there by far.

476
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,575
Some of the older kids
wanted to make sure I knew it.

477
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,045
So they jumped me.

478
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,216
I fought back,
but one of them had a shiv

479
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:55,086
And I figured that was it

480
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,922
Until mick stepped in.

481
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,058
And they didn't mess
with me after that.

482
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,130
He's been standing up for me
ever since.

483
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,835
- Let's just hope he's
standing up for rip and jax now.

484
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:14,639

take on those pirates?

It's not your fault.
It's his.

506

you've forgotten, mr. Rory,

507

You volunteered to be
part of this boarding party.

508
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,870
- I volunteered to get
away from my partner,

509
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,706
Who hasn't been
acting like my partner

510
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,741
Ever since you fed his head
with fairy tales

About saving the world.

512
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,677
- Your partner has a mind
of his own,

513
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,279
Mr. Rory, which is more
than I can say of you.

514
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,181
- Are you saying
that I'm dumb, captain?

515
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,849
- Let's pretend,
just for a moment,

516
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,317
That you're the captain,

517
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,086
Stuck in the brig
while the rest of your crew

518
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,822
Slowly perish
on their damaged ship.

519
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,457
Now, what would you do
to get yourself

520
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,559
Out of that predicament?

521

Oh, no brilliant ideas?
Really?

522
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,463
Why am I not in
the least bit surprised?

523
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,897
- Shut your mouth, now!

524
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,966
- Okay, let's all just
take a deep breath.

525
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,468
- Or what?
You'll punch me in the face,

526
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,669
Or burn me alive,
or employ

527
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,237
Some other barbaric form
of violence?

528
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,840
- That's why you recruited me,
isn't it?

529
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,208
To hit, hurt, and burn?

530
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,776
- No, I recruited you
because you and your partner

531
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,045
Were a package deal.

532
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,413
- What?
- I'm sorry, mr. Rory.

533
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,181
But a serial arsonist
was never part of my plan

534
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:09,487
To stop savage, much less one
with the iq of meat.

535

I didn't mean to be so blunt.

536

If I could just have
a moment of quiet,

537
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,226
Then perhaps I can think
of a way

538
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,295
Of getting us off
this pirate ship.

539
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,467

I just beat you to it.

- About a timeship.

00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,875
- Because my sister
lives in 2016.

873
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,778
And your sister,
and your wife.

874
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,846
- So what exactly
are we talking about here?

875
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,149
Leaving rory in the brig
until we take down savage?

876
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,584
- No, no, no, no,
the brig is unsuitable

877
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,219
For long-term incarceration.

878
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,722
- Leaving him free run
of the ship is not an option.

879
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:26,956
- I'll handle it.

880
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,958
- By handling it,
you mean murder?

881
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,296
- I said I'll handle it.

882
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,299
<i>[ominous music]</i>

883
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:42,639
<i>â™ª</i>

884
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,175
- [grunts]

885
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:47,177
[groaning]

886
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,282
- [sighs]

887
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:56,753
- I told you that'll be
the last time you hit me.

888
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,856
- You were right.

889
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,925
- That the plan?

890
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,727
Take me out
in the middle of nowhere,

891
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,864
Where no one can find the body?

892
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,101
- I wish there were
some other way, mick,

893
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,771
But you're dangerous.

894
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,974
A liability to the team.
- Team?

895
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,778
You and I were a team!

896
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,482
What happened to you?

897
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,717
- People change.

898
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,253
- You think you're
some kind of hero,

899
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,655
But deep down
you're still the same

900
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,825
Punk kid I saved in juvie.

901
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,828
You haven't got the guts.

902
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,297
You want to kill me?

903
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,000
Kill me.

904
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:48,171
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

905
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,878
- You're right.
