When he does, we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

152
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,686
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

153
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,842
but what he wants to acquire.

154
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,968
Because that's where he'll be next.

155
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,601
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

156
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,809
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

157
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,690
You want me to tell you where my labs are?

158
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,882
Well... let's say...

159
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,080
that I share that information. Hmm?
What happens to my labs?

160
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,524
Oh, Judy.

161
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,365
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

162
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,364
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

163
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,766
Mmm. You're right.

164
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,806
He would be very proud of me.

165
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,851
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

166
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,288
I'm from the Medellin cartel.
I know what I am.

167
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,366
I don't need bullshit art
hanging on my wall t0 prove any different.

168
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,408
Wait, wait, wait.

169
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,090
Hold on.

170
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,689
Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

171
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,681
But...

172
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,131
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

173
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,124
What good is it if he's arrested?

174
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,640
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

175
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,087
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

176
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,609
You think the police will kill him?

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,288
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

178
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,330
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

179
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,405
<i>[Steve] This was one thing that
the Cali guys and the DEA could</i> agree <i>on.</i>

180

<i>As controversial
as Colonel Carrillo 's methods were,</i>

181
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,770
<i>he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.</i>

182
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,928
<i>And returning command
of Search Bloc to him</i>

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,207
<i>was exactly what we needed.</i>

184
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,285
The president has offered us every
available resource to defeat Escobar.

185
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,362
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

186
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,886
So I'm still gonna rely on
intelligence from you.

187
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,567
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

188
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,486
No more large-scale operations. Search
Bloc goes back to small-scale tactics.

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,767
- Amen.
- Stealth operations, surprise raids,

190
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,968
that sort of thing. We change the game.

191
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,043
But there's one thing
that we need to do first. Trujillo.

192
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,890
[in Spanish] Assemble the Search Bloc
outside. I want 100 men and six trucks.

193
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,770
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it'?
- On it, Colonel.

194
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,040
[in English] A hundred men?
That's not exactly small-scale tactics.

195
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,844
First thing is,
we let Pablo know that we're back.

<i>in the secrecy we required.</i>

206

Colonel Carrillo.</i>

00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,323
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

463
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,805
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogoté.

464
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,524
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

465
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,924
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

466
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,688
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

467
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,445
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

468
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,410
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

469
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,767
What about you, Gato?

470
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,366
All right.

471
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,802
If it's going to be like this...

<i>[David]
A bunch of men.</i>

475
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,846
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

476
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,968
Are you sure they were police?

477
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,724
Yes.

478
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,165
What now?

479
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,010
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

480
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,570
Asshole, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

481
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,727
It's your last chance, Gato.

482
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,406
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

489

It worked.

490
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,491
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

491
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,484
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

492
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,522
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

493
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,366
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

494
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,002
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.

Yeah, I'm... good.
I just need to hear your voice.
