[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,211
I need you to help me find my son.

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,296
The men your son investigated,

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,967
when they discovered his arrest,
they broke into prison.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,219
Take him. They are called the Jackals.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,888
-You let my boy go.
-We need your son.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,558
After all, he's our boss.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,769
Hello, Father.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,148
It's been a long time.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,820
[Joe] You should have stayed dead.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,489
[Slade] I heard you were in trouble, kid.

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,116
So I thought I'd offer my help.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,534
[Joe] My old man.

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,495
Here to save me. Last I saw,

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,873
you weren't all that concerned
with saving anyone.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,585
Apple doesn't fall that far.

17
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,088
What are you thinking?

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,718
-Patricide?
-He's seen our operation.

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,887
Makes him a liability.

20
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,764
Yeah, you can have that choice.

21
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,223
But I'll give you another one.

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,100
Let me join you.

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,978
If I wanted a family reunion,

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,605
I would have sent an invitation.

25
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,231
Maybe you did.

26
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,651
But you just haven't realized it yet, kid.

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,529
See, I came all this way
to speak with you.

28
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,282
And I will kill anybody who gets in my way

29
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,453
because I got nothing
left to lose, only you.

30
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,706
So go ahead.

31
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,667
And make a decision.

32
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,805
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
swayed by the poetry of it all.

33
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,973
But can I trust you?

34
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,018
Trust is built upon honesty.

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm sure you have a lot
of questions to ask me.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,691
And I have a lot
of questions for you, Joe.

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,443
That's not my name anymore.

38
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,196
Your mother named you something different

39
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,990
to keep us apart.

40
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,370
Okay.

41
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,665
Guess we got some catching up to do.

42
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,265
{\an8}[Slade groaning softly]

43
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,776
I'm not leaving you.

44
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,947
[Joe] Father.

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,121
Joe!

46
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,751
-How are you feeling?
-How did I get here?

47
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,921
[Joe] Evac found you. Washed up
on the Philippine coast.

48
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,548
They said you were barely conscious.

49
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,175
Just muttering someone's name.

50
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,554
"Oliver." Who is he?

51
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,517
[gasps]

52
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,686
[grunts]

53
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,063
[breathing heavily]

54
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,523
Father?

55
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,611
It's just someone that owed me a debt.

56
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,572
Everyone left you for dead.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,783
But I knew you'd come back.

58
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,495
I won't ever leave you again, Joe.

59
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,669
I promise.

60
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,644
[comms beeps]

61
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,104
Wild Dog, Terrific. You ready to do this?

62
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,106
[Wild Dog] <i>Always, but I got bad news.</i>

63
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,067
These guys aren't just thieves.

64
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,069
They killed a security guard.

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,363
Make that two.

66
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,114
These guys aren't playing around.

67
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,407
Neither are we.

68
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,706
[grunting]

69
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,647
Incoming! Fall back!

70
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,565
Now!

71
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,867
Curtis, you're right. The thieves were
after the components of a 3D printer.

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,286
Two innocent people get killed

73
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,746
'cause some psycho
wants to print plastic toys?

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,499
This wasn't a consumer 3D printer.
This was military grade.

75
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,251
You're saying there's a printer
that can print weapons?

76
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,003
Or drones, or chemicals.

77
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,380
Sorry I missed the fun,
anyone want to catch me up?

78
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,756
Break-in, Cadmus Tech.

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,841
Thinking Cayden James?

80
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,426
That's what we were assuming,
but this crew

81
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,969
doesn't look like the type
he usually runs with.

82
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,596
That would track with some new street
chatter SCPD has been hearing lately.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,265
-What kind of chatter?
-New player.

84
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,018
No idea what his game is.
All we have is his street name.

85
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
-Dragon.
-Dragon? [chuckles]

86
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,522
-That's colorful.
-Tomorrow's problem.

87
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,859
Why don't we all get some rack time,
hit this fresh in the morning.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,626
{\an8}[Kane] Excuse the poor accommodations.

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,504
{\an8}Don't plan on staying in this stain
of a country too long.

90
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,133
{\an8}Well, there's a reason why they say
the money is in the muck.

91
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,093
{\an8}I did bring one luxury however.

92
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,390
Oh, there's a blast from the past.

93
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,103
My favorite. I never realized
you'd acquired a taste for it too.

94
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,898
{\an8}Like you told me, always drink good booze.

95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,568
{\an8}And only look out for yourself.

96
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,489
{\an8}[Slade] The Jackals are an unruly bunch.

97
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,659
{\an8}Must've been hard trying to keep ASIS
in the dark for so long.

98
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,411
{\an8}It's amazing what an agency overlooks

99
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,455
{\an8}when it's willing to leave
its own men for dead.

100
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,664
{\an8}[chuckles]

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,001
{\an8}[Slade] So what kind of operation
are you planning on running here?

102
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,671
{\an8}Drugs, weapons?

103
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,049
{\an8}Perhaps a military coup.

104
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,095
{\an8}Let's call it a re-assignment
of resources.

105
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,516
{\an8}A lucrative one.

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,316
Hey, babe.

107
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,736
{\an8}Hey.

108
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,782
{\an8}I didn't wanna wake you.

109
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,076
{\an8}I am still on Vlatava time.

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,961
Besides, I heard a rumor that the
Green Arrow was gonna be here.

111
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,380
-[chuckles]
-And I'd never miss a chance to see him.

112
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,800
You know, when you took this on,

113
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,844
I think I got a pretty good sense

114
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,888
of how you felt when I took
Amanda Waller's place at A.R.G.U.S.

115
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,515
Not that bad, I hope.

116
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,309
But seeing you like this,

117
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,478
being the Green Arrow,

118
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,857
it suits you.

119
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,238
-Let's go to bed.
-Mmm.

120
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,326
{\an8}Hey. Hey.

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,413
{\an8}Let me clean up first.

122
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,623
{\an8}Okay.

123
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,626
{\an8}Don't be too long.

124
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,397
{\an8}[cell phone vibrating]

125
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,574
{\an8}So, you and your boy,

00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,951
{\an8}one big happy family again, huh?

127
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,453
{\an8}[Slade] None of your business.

128
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,248
{\an8}He told me about your new job,
the reassignment of resources.

129
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,209
{\an8}Tell me about that.

130
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,419
{\an8}The boss didn't think to tell you.

131
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,922
{\an8}And that means it's none of your
business, comrade.

{\an8}Main hall, 30 minutes.

{\an8}[Oliver] [whispering] Slade.

134
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,309
{\an8}[whispering] What are you doing here?
You should have gone home.

135
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,019
{\an8}I don't abandon people.

136

{\an8}Even when they leave me drugged.

137
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,065
Now, what is this reassignment
of resources

138
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,691
that your son and his men are planning?

139
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,068
You overheard that?

140
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,529
{\an8}Just like I overheard
your plan to join his unit.

141
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,949
{\an8}Your son is dangerous, Slade.

142

He's just a younger version of me.

143
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,036
No, you were never a gun for hire.

144
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,663
I was a killer.

145
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,624
{\an8}Listen, kid, you better go home,

146
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,503
before you find yourself in trouble
you can't get out of.

147
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,338
I can't walk away from this.

148
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,216
Can you?

149
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,644
[Nylander] Feeling at home yet,
Slade? Hmm?

150
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,771
Or should I call you Deathstroke?

151
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,567
[Joe] Slight change in plans, gentlemen.

152
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,571
Forty percent of our Semtex
was compromised during transfer.

153
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,783
Conveniently, however, the Kasnian army
is doing some transferring of its own.

154
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,244
I'm gonna take a small team to intercept.

155
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,912
Does this jeopardize our timeline?

156
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,415
Not with the infamous Deathstroke
backing me up.

157
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,417
What do you say, Father?

158
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,586
Interested in showing us how it's done?

159
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,963
As long as your dogs can keep up.

160
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,632
I'll go pack some gear.

-Hi, kid.
-Comms are working.

163
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,108
Kane has me making a run for Semtex.

164
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,735
[Oliver] <i>That's a high-yield explosive.</i>

165
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,362
With Nylander involved
I should've expected it.

166
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,448
Well, he'll probably be handling
the detonator.

167
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,409
If you can find the receiver,
perhaps you can corrupt it.

168
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>-It might be in Nylander's gear.</i>
-I'm on it.

169
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,080
You good?

170
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,707
Just find the receiver.

171
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,173
Keep varying your pace.

172
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,758
My pace is fine, old man.

173
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,969
So you say.

Come on, get up.

00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,812
How are you better with one eye
than I am with two?

178
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,106
You must learn to move with your mind.

179
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,316
Not your eyes.

Thank you.

New prototype. Should be ready in a year.

That's gotta be tempting, right?

191
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,360
Not in the slightest. Enough distractions.

192
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,153
Let's train.

You got to talk to the boss.

-This the guy you told me about?

-That's right.

Anyone want to guess?

You guys are no fun.
His street name is Dragon.

[Dinah Drake] This jerk wad's been
out of prison less than a month.

00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,310
He's already racked up a body count.

259

of life plus one.

-[Curtis] What's that?
-[Dinah] It's life without parole.

261
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,482
What's he doing walking around?

262
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,068
State Supreme court overturned
his convictions due to technicalities.

263
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,154
But before he was on the inside,
he was running with a group called

264
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,739
the Scorpions in the Glades.

265
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,949
John, do you know anything
about the Scorpions?

266
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,285
John?

267
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,704
John, John, Earth to John Diggle.
The Scorpions?

268
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,874
The Scorpions, yeah, I know them.

269
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,377
But Diaz is on something different.
New muscle, new crew. Way too organized.

270
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,129
[Rene] Wonder when he got himself
a new crew.

271
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,922
How he got to be the boss of it.

272
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,216
Why he needs a weapons grade 3D printer.

273
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,927
I think I have the answer to that.

274
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,305
Drugs. High-end ones.

275
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,098
I cross-referenced
the two models that were stolen

276
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,809
and what they have in common is
their capacity to simultaneously print

277
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,437
inert polypropylenes
and soft material catalyst composites.

278
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,231
Did anyone understand a word of that?

279
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,983
You think Diaz is making reactionware?

280
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
-Anyone normal.
-With this equipment?

281
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,113
Diaz cuts out the middle man.
He can make designer drugs

282
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,616
more cheaply and efficiently
than anyone else on the street.

283
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,534
The hell he is.
Whatever science experiment

284
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,286
he's got going on, we're shutting it down.

285
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,789
Curtis, let's work up a location
for Diaz's operation.

286
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,998
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,296
-You okay, chief?
-Yeah.

288
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,258
Been a while since a perp got
the drop on me. That's all.

289
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,968
We'll make sure Diaz pays for that.

290
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,019
So what are you planning
with all these explosives?

291
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,646
I'd like to know.

292
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,856
You missed your kill shot
with the soldier back there.

293
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,276
Well, when I lost this eye,
I lost my depth perception.

294
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,655
Most of my men think
you joined me under false pretenses.

295
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,492
There's nothing false
about trying to find my son.

296
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,286
But if they doubt me...

297
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,958
Then maybe I don't have your trust.

298
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,626
Of course, you do.

299
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
That's why I got you a little gift.

300
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,095
You told me not to worry, brother.

301
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,847
[groans]

302
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,099
[Kane] Nylander found him
with my detonator.

303
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,145
Some might see this as coincidence.
But I see it as fate.

304
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,898
It's time to collect on that debt
he owes your father.

305
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,654
Oliver Queen! I've waited a very,

306
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,948
very long time for this.

307
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,080
An eye for an eye.

308
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,255
[Shado] You're lying to yourself, Slade.

309
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,175
You know he's alive.

310
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,343
You've always known.

311
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,888
But still you do nothing. [echoing]

312
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,556
You know what he did to me.

313
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,350
You know what he took from us.

314
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,813
Yet here you are, hiding like a coward.

315
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,023
[panting]

316
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,650
[Shado] Getting weak. Pathetic.

317
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,821
Give me what you promised.

318
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,407
Give me what you promised.

319
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,202
Get out of my head!

320
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,458
Not until Oliver Queen is dead.

321
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,756
He is dead. He died on the <i>Amazo.</i>

Listen, love,

326
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,813
you're the only one who can avenge me.

You're the only one

329
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,029
You know why?

330
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,367
I keep my promises.

331
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,387
[trainee] Sir, is everything okay?

[sword clanging]

335
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,115
You are telling me
you became the Green Arrow

336
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,491
after you knew about the tremor?

337
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,909
I was gonna tell Oliver.

338
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,745
But then he asked me to take over
for him. I couldn't let him down.

339
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,874
-I couldn't let the team down.
-But you were physically compromised.

340
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,710
I came up with a temporary solution.

341
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,628
An experimental steroid.

342
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,590
Lyla, I wanted to tell you so bad,
I know it was the wrong call.

343
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,261
-I'm sorry.
-I'm just glad you finally told me.

344
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,096
But now that I have, I need your help.

345
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,556
Is there anything,

346
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,934
anything that A.R.G.U.S. is working
on that could help my condition?

347
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,729
I thought it was just
some kind of steroid.

348
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,773
Yeah, we found out that
the manufacturer's involved in...

349
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,027
criminal activity.

350
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,904
He and his crew have killed
at least two people.

351
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,114
I don't know, maybe more.

352
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,452
Right, so your experimental steroid
is actually an illegal drug.

353
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,372
Look, if this is what it's taken
for you to come clean,

354
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,710
and get this guy off of the street,
then I guess I should be grateful.

355
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,629
What?

356
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,178
[sighs] You're still using the drug.

357
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,847
And I guess that means that
the drug dealer is out there too.

358
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,974
To be Green Arrow means
I have to be physically capable

359
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,185
of protecting the city, no matter what.

360
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,438
Lyla, you make the same choices
at A.R.G.U.S. all the time.

361
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,023
Choices you've condemned me for making.

362
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,400
I know I'm wrong,
but I couldn't let Oliver down.

363
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,819
So you let yourself down instead.

364
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,698
Johnny, you are the most moral man I know.

365
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,326
I can't even begin to fathom
how you could do this.

366
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,370
As soon as A.R.G.U.S. has a solution,
I'll get my guy off the street.

367
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,956
Until then, how many more people
is this guy going to kill?

368
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,834
It's not that simple.
It's not that simple.

369
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,586
You're the one who taught me that it is.

370
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,214
[sighs]

371
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,298
Lyla, can we please...

372
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,675
No, I just...
I want to be alone right now.

373
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,098
[door closes]

374
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,982
Years ago, I made you a promise.

375
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,818
Do you remember?

376
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,028
I promised that you would suffer

377
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,116
the same way that I suffered.

378
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,326
What are you doing?

379
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,704
You are not this person anymore.

380
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,501
What I am is a father

381
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,754
reunited with my son.

382
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,298
I made him a promise too.

383
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,634
And I'm not going to break it again.

384
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,053
We made each other a promise, Slade.

385
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,890
To save our sons.

386
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,395
To save Joe, to save William.

387
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,230
He has a son.

388
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,485
I'll make sure he suffers too.

389
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,748
Slade.

390
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,793
Do it.

391
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,170
Slade!

392
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,798
Slade!

393

[grunts]

394
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,935
That was a little too convincing.
We gotta go.

395
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,645
Come on.

396
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,151
[grunting]

397
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,492
-There's no way out.
-Let's make our own way. Come on.

398
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,717
I'll send out the dogs.

399
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,136
We've got the op.

400
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,846
That's where they'll be.

401
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,474
You sure?

402
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,268
That my father would try to stop us?

403
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,937
That's what fathers do.

404
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,940
And that's why I'm gonna kill him.

405
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,570
[Oliver] Before they captured me,
I saw what Kane was going after.

406
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,281
Attacking the water supply,

407
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,951
it's a death sentence
for half the country.

408
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,204
If we move now,
we might be able to stop them.

409
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,668
If that's what you want.

410
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,756
I spared your life back there.

411
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,549
I know.

412
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,594
Back there, it didn't feel like an act

413
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,681
the same way it did with Chase
back on Lian Yu.

414
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,724
Because when I saw my son,

415
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,394
I was tempted.

416
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,147
I would have done anything
to keep us together.

417
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,608
But when you mentioned William,

418
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,653
I realized that's not my boy.

419
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,032
It's Kane.

420
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,870
And what I fear is there's
only one way to stop him.

421
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,706
Slade.

422
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,294
There are other ways to deal with this
that don't involve killing your son.

423
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,256
Deep down, he's your boy
so you have to reason with him.

424
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,425
And I swear, he will listen to you.

425
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,177
But I didn't tell you
what happened after Lian Yu.

426
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,724
I went home to my son and I promised him

427
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,559
I would stay and never leave.

428
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,311
And I broke that promise.

429
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,646
You broke the promise
because of the Mirakuru.

430
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,648
[Slade] The Mirakuru faded for a while.

431
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,360
But when it came back,
it was like a storm I could not control.

432
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,782
And that monster is what my son
is trying to emulate.

433
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,579
But it's not Mirakuru with Joe.
It's anger and resentment.

434
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,207
And I don't know how that can be redeemed.

435
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,710
Well, I didn't think that
you could be redeemed.

436
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,838
But I'm here, miles from home,

437
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,423
miles from my son,

438
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,508
trying to help you save yours.

439
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,470
And I can do that because I knew
the man that you were

440
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,055
before the Mirakuru.

441
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,850
That is who your son needs to see.
He needs to see his father.

442
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,977
The man you are right now, tonight.

Drop your weapon.

No. Not until you tell me
what you're doing.

448
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,183
They were trying to stop me.

449

What the hell are you talking about?

450
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,895

00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,856

Ricardo Diaz is good.

How's the research on
his old associates going?

How the hell did you get that?

It's a contact. That's all I can say.

464

of activity inside.

about the Semtex, huh.

I knew you'd show up.

I should have told you all about
the tremor from the beginning.

-I'm truly sorry I didn't.
-So you're saying

-in Star City?
-Yes.

And that's why, Rene, I owe you
the biggest apology of all.

You should've known what was going on
before we ever got to that bridge, man.

My pride almost got you killed.

All I can ask is that you forgive me,
but I understand if you can't.

646
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,863
Getting shot wasn't great.

647
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,324
But if I'm counting the times
you saved my life

648
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,368
against the times you almost
got me killed,

649
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,495
you're still ahead.

650
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,833
I, for one, am incredibly offended.

651
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,626
And you have every right to be, Curtis.

652
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,212
That you didn't come to me first
for help treating you.

653
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,965
I created a chip to help
a woman walk, people.

654
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,425
He's got a point, John.

655
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,885
Might be time to outsource
this little problem.

656
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,972
Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,181
Outstanding.

658
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,559
So have you already had an electromyogram?

659
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,686
Wait, what am I talking about? We need
to start off with an NCV test first.

660
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,647
Curtis, it's been a long night.

661
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,400
Is there any way
we can do this in the morning?

662
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,609
Sure thing.

663
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,028
It would be my honor.

664
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,157
-It would be my pleasure.
-[fake cough] Kiss-ass.

665
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,284
What the... I'm trying to...

666
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,043
You waiting on a special apology?
Because you deserve one.

667
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,545
No.

668
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,256
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

669
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,883
-Really?
-Really.

670
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,676
Well, I'm gonna give you one anyway.

671
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,429
Dinah, I lied to you and I'm sorry,

672
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,972
but I'll make one more promise.

673
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,975
There'll be no more secrets
between you and me.

674
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,143
No more secrets.
