been since I was a kid.

FRANK:<i> The Court is a secret society.</i>

If it's so secret, how
do you know about them?

5

Your father and I were both members.

There's someone I need to kill.

This city is on the brink of chaos.

00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:42,647
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

22

Members of the Ruling Council,

23
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:48,187
Gotham has fallen ill.

24
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,157
Violence and crime continue to spread

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,793
like an unstoppable disease.

26
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:57,163
Drastic action must be taken.

27
00:00:57,196 --> 00:01:01,634
To that end, a weapon is being built.

28
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,037
A weapon intended to
be unleashed on Gotham

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,909
so that the city may be
cleansed and rebuilt by us.

Alfred will figure it out.

Perhaps.

All right, come on people, come on.

Let's get back to work.
Joe, shut that off.

Can you believe this nonsense?

After all that's said and
done, who's back in charge?

62
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:39,057
Aubrey James. The
original crook himself.

63
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,659
How was the cabin?

64
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:41,892
What?

65
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:45,196
You and your uncle. You must've
had a lot to catch up on.

66
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,931
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,099
Any word on Nygma?

68
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,836
No. But after gassing the cadets

69
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,705
and dangling me over an empty stairwell,

70
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,740
he just disappeared.

71
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:57,008
No riddles, puzzles or
singing telegrams, yet.

72
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,846
Who's, uh, "Michael Ness"?

73
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,215
(sighs) The drunk driver who
hit and killed my father

74
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:04,749
when I was nine.

75
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:06,819
Something my uncle said got me thinking.

76
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:08,753
- What do you got?
- Not much.

77
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,255
He was convicted of
vehicular manslaughter.

78
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,225
Got six years.

79
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,961
Then got his ticket punched in a
prison stabbing a few months in.

80
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:16,861
Silver lining.

81
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:18,229
Yeah.

82
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:21,000
But I pulled his medical
file from Blackgate,

83
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,368
found something that wasn't
in the original case file.

84
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:25,137
He had "chronic persistent hepatitis."

85
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,640
I was gonna ask Lee what
it was when she got in.

86
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,109
Chronic persistent hepatitis
is a non-progressive form

87
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,378
of liver inflammation.

88
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,246
How do you know that?

89
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,849
You kidding? It's known
as the Irish Curse.

90
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,416
With chronic inflammation,

91
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,985
you cannot drink. Nothing, not a drop.

92
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:41,854
Not even beer.

93
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,255
Well, this guy didn't get the memo.
His blood alcohol

94
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,255
was off the charts the
night of the accident.

95
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,858
You're not hearing me.

96
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,760
If this guy had chronic
liver inflammation,

97
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,293
if he blew a 0.1

98
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,996
on a blood alcohol test,

99
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,866
he'd be dead before he
got behind the wheel.

100
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,036
If that's true, then someone
dummied the report.

101
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,871
Can you do some digging?

102
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:00,272
Find out who this guy was?

103
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:01,172
Sure, but... Hey.

104
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,109
Where you going?

105
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,885
Ta-da!

106
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,018
Pretty cool, huh?

107
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,287
I told you the whole estate

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,022
was abandoned... can you believe it?

109
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,023
- As a matter of fact, I can.
- You know,

110
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,926
the fresh air will do you good.

111
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,028
It smells like rotting death in here.

112
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,799
- Oh. I think someone's hungry.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

113
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,168
I... told you I am fine!

114
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,335
I am a grown man, for crying out loud!

115
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:33,071
(singsongy): And you're hungry.

116
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:34,439
(giggling)

117
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:36,074
Ah...

118
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:39,043
What's with you and all the plants?

119
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,313
Oh, they're my friends.

120
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,047
Your friends?

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,183
- Yeah.
- (quietly): Wonderful.

122
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,452
You know, plants make better
friends than most people.

123
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,388
And some of them helped save your life.

124
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,191
It's broth.

125
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:55,927
I even put in some white
willow for your fever.

126
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,328
(mug shatters)

127
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:59,797
- What is wrong with you?
- For the millionth time,

128
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,967
I need to get back to Gotham!

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,335
What's the rush?!

130
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,471
I was betrayed<i> and</i> shot.

131
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:08,506
I should be plotting my
revenge, building an army,

132
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,342
not drinking pinecone juice

133
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,978
with the... crazy plant lady.

134
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,080
So build an army. No one's stopping you.

135
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,950
And I could even help
if you weren't being

136
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,217
such a jerk.

137
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,385
Jerk.

138
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,289
Fine.

139
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,226
I need you to deliver a message

140
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,960
to Gabe.

141
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,095
Who's Gabe?

142
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:33,097
He's a moron.

143
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,868
But... he is a loyal moron.

144
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,535
And every army starts

145
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,806
with one single loyal soldier.

146
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:48,313
"Please."

147
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,849
(whispering): Please?

148
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,252
Okay.

149
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,953
Fine.

150
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,409
Thank you for meeting me.

151
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,210
Why here?

152
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,580
It's public, open,

153
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:25,551
easy to spot if anyone's watching us.

154
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:28,554
The driver who hit my father's
car that night wasn't drunk.

155
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:30,421
I think he did it on purpose,

156
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,890
and someone made it
look like an accident.

157
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:35,327
Easy enough for the Court.

158
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:39,030
So let's say I believe you.

159
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:42,034
What do you want from me?

160
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,936
I have just learned something

161
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,904
I am still having trouble believing.

162
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:50,909
A weapon is en route, headed for Gotham.

163
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,578
A weapon the Court intends
to use to destroy the city.

164
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,614
What are you talking about?

165
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,182
You said the Court controls Gotham.

166
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,916
Why would they want to destroy it?

167
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,919
This isn't the Court as a whole.

168
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,922
It's limited to a number
of high-ranking members,

169
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:06,925
fanatics who believe the
city needs to be cleansed.

170
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,960
And you really think
they're capable of this?

171
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,595
They've done it before.

172
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,631
Twice in the city's history
they've laid waste to Gotham.

173
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,068
It's no bluff.

174
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,337
So how do we stop it?

175
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,104
I have no idea.

176
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:22,940
I don't even know what the weapon is.

177
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,142
But that's exactly what
I'm going to find out.

178
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:26,945
- I can help.
- No. The Court knows

179
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:28,646
I reached out to you, but that's all.

180
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,348
We need to keep it that way,

181
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,551
in case I'm discovered.

182
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,589
Be careful, Uncle Frank.

183
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,386
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

184
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:08,986
I saw you earlier.

185
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,423
Who was that man you were with?

186
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:14,992
My Uncle Frank.

187
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:18,195
I thought you two were estranged.

188
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:19,998
We recently reconnected.

189
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:23,068
Good for you.

190
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,672
(Thompkins sighs) I've
been coming here a lot.

191
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,041
The other day I saw this...

192
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,544
little old man, must
have been in his 90s,

193
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,145
all dressed up,

194
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,281
standing in front of his wife's grave...

195
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,150
smiling.

196
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:41,653
I couldn't understand what
there was to smile about.

197
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:47,392
And then it occurred to me.

198
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:52,096
They shared a whole life together.

199
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,635
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,574
How do you do that?

201
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:05,043
How do you just... move on,

202
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:08,247
leaving so much
destruction in your wake?

203
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:15,521
I wish I could do that.

204
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,493
(phone buzzing)

205
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,197
- Yeah?
- BULLOCK: Hey.

206
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,099
That driver that hit and
killed your father that night

207
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,100
was a career scumbag.

208
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,335
What'd you find out?

209
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,470
He did a stretch for grand theft auto,

210
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:34,071
among other things, and get this...

211
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,606
the high-priced lawyer
who got him his plea

212
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,378
was paid for by none other
than Carmine Falcone.

213
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,262
- (laughing)
- (strained): Okay, that's... easy. Okay.

214
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:51,866
Okay, that's enough.

215
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,268
(grunts, laughs)

216
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,738
Oh, Boss, I can't believe it.

217
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,245
You know that everyone
thinks you're dead.

218
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,697
- Yes.
- And that Barbara's running things?

219
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,878
Gabe, this might go faster
if you just listen.

220
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,324
I need to build an army

221
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,225
to exact my revenge,

222
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:06,826
and to take back my throne.

223
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,276
Will you help me?

224
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:10,214
Of course I will. When the guys hear

225
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:11,981
that you're still alive,
they'll come running.

226
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,082
I'll make sure of it.

227
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,651
What do you want me to do?

228
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,619
That.

229
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,622
I want you to do that, Gabe.

230
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,223
Right. I got it.

231
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,558
No problem.

232
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,962
Hey...

233
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:28,131
Um... there's something<i> off</i> about him.

234
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:29,399
No argument there.

235
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,500
I don't trust him.

236
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,403
Gabe?

237
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,506
He's a human Labrador. You
whistle, he comes running.

238
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,539
Trust me, he's loyal.

239
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,375
I have this perfume.

240
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:42,012
One whiff, and a man
will do anything I ask.

241
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,413
Including telling the truth.

242
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,416
Look, now that Gabe is here,

243
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,650
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

244
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,285
I have an army to build,

245
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,421
a war to plan,

246
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:54,258
and we really do not know
each other that well.

247
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,526
You understand.

248
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,027
No.

249
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:01,398
Maybe you can ask one of your plants.

250
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,567
I do not trust you.

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,034
I saved your life.

252
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,569
My men are on their way.

253
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,005
You trust him?

254
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,406
But I...

255
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,308
I thought we were friends.

256
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,277
(snorts) Friends?

257
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,678
(chuckling): Friends.

258
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,181
Oh.

259
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,048
You're being serious.

260
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,452
Look, don't take this the wrong way,

261
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:24,654
but you are a bit of a freak.

262
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,592
(door opens, closes)

263
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,428
Did she tell you not to trust me?

264
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,364
Yeah.

265
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:37,101
Why?

266
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:41,739
Smart girl.

267
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,700
♪ ♪

268
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,062
♪ ♪

269
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:54,444
Shall we begin?

270
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,596
♪ ♪

271
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,493
The temple is some sort
of maze, is that it?

272
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,804
Everything is a maze, Bruce.
The only difference

273
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:34,993
is whether we realize
our place within it.

274
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:37,163
Given enough time, I
will find a way out.

275
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,900
How much time?

276
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:42,471
How long have you been blindly
running down the corridors

277
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:46,041
of your life only to end
up in the same place?

278
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:48,644
It's time to pick a direction.

279
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:51,546
You can speak in cryptic
riddles all you want.

280
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,648
I'm not scared of you.

281
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:56,684
But you are scared of
something, aren't you?

282
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:00,756
Sit.

283
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:04,559
Let me show you what I have to offer.

284
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,768
You have some nerve showing up here.

285
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,503
We need to talk. Alone.

286
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:16,771
No, we don't.

287
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,173
You took my son from me.

288
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,908
And you took my father away from me.

289
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,911
I'd say that makes us even.

290
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:24,646
Your father was killed
by a drunk driver.

291
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,048
No, he wasn't.

292
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,049
The driver wasn't drunk.
He hit us on purpose.

293
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,453
But I think you know that because
you paid for his lawyer.

294
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,857
Still think we have
nothing to talk about?

295
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,198
If you have a question for me, son...

296
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:45,234
why not go ahead and ask it?

297
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,835
Did you order the hit on my father?

298
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,070
No.

299
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,105
I respected your father.

300
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,109
Much more than the son he left behind.

301
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:55,576
But someone did.

302
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,745
It was a hit?

303
00:15:58,246 --> 00:15:59,881
Yes.

304
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:04,085
The Court of Owls.

305
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,954
What do you know about them?

306
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:09,558
I know my uncle is a member.

307
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,593
- Are you?
- No.

308
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,996
But we've built a
partnership which has been

309
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:16,231
mutually beneficial over the years.

310
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,866
You mean you do their bidding.

311
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,269
Everyone does the Court's bidding.

312
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,603
Some of us just know it.

313
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,839
The person who came to you...

314
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,775
a member of the Court?

315
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,144
Yes.

316
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:30,611
Who was it?

317
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:34,149
Who ordered the hit on my father?

318
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,084
I want a name.

319
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,757
Frank Gordon.

320
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,626
Your uncle.

321
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,794
(door closes)

322
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:00,609
Hello, Jim.

323
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:01,945
Thought we could use a drink.

324
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,159
Is it true?

325
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,363
Did you order the hit on my father?

326
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:14,300
Carmine called the Court after you left.

327
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,915
You shouldn't have gone there.

328
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,148
It'll raise suspicions.

329
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,717
Is it true?

330
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:24,055
Yes.

331
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,358
Why?

332
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:28,994
I already told you...

333
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:31,261
your father was determined
to expose the Court

334
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,831
and became a risk.

335
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:33,898
Simple as that.

336
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,232
So you had him killed?

337
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:36,735
Your own brother?

338
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,369
You want to shoot me, Jim?

339
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,837
You'd be doing me a favor.

340
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,372
But it won't change anything.

341
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:43,207
The only thing we can do now

342
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:46,177
is finish what Peter started
and bring down the Court.

343
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,379
It's what he would have wanted.

344
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,912
What my father would have wanted

345
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,948
is for justice to be done.

346
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,120
So do I.

347
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,856
Frank Gordon, you're under arrest

348
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,991
for the murder of Peter Gordon.
Turn around.

349
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,793
Turn around!

350
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,060
Have you not been listening?

351
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,662
You have the right to remain silent.

352
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,164
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

353
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,998
- in a court of law.
- Arrest me

354
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,768
- and it's over.
- You have the right to an attorney.

355
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:10,935
Stopping them is the
only thing that matters.

356
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,004
- My father mattered!
- (sighs)

357
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:14,271
(grunts)

358
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,279
Dock 9C.

359
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:23,915
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

360
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:25,417
It's all I've been able to find out.

361
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:28,018
I need to speak with the
Court, try to buy some time.

362
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,088
You need to find out when the
weapon will be arriving,

363
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,755
and you need to do it without the Court

364
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,091
finding out you're involved.

365
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:37,027
Otherwise... we're both dead.

366
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,764
Make a choice, Jim.

367
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:42,967
(door opens, closes)

368
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,944
I didn't think you had it in you.

369
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:54,478
I know.

370
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,915
You never did.

371
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,917
Oh, boo-hoo.

372
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,052
Is that what this is about?

373
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:04,054
No one gave you a gold
star for thuggery?

374
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:07,024
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it already.

375
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,796
I ain't gonna kill you.

376
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,033
We're gonna auction off that right

377
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:17,968
to the highest bidder.

378
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,971
(car approaches outside)

379
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,473
We?

380
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:24,374
That would be my sales force.

381
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,976
(car doors open)

382
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:48,532
If he had just listened to me, but no.

383
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,501
Nobody listens to Ivy...

384
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,742
(sighs)

385
00:19:58,341 --> 00:19:59,777
BULLOCK:<i> Whoa.</i>

386
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,111
That's a lot to take in.

387
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,847
Tell me about it.

388
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,783
A secret organization that
controls all of Gotham?

389
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,551
If that's true, somebody should tell 'em

390
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,853
they're doing a pretty terrible job.

391
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,523
He told you all this at the cabin?

392
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,391
Most of it. The weapon
intended to destroy the city...

393
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,860
that's a new wrinkle
he threw at me today.

394
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,864
Quite the family reunion you're having.

395
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:23,400
I didn't mean to involve
you in all this,

396
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,904
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

397
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,272
Way I see it, as hard as it was

398
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,139
to hear what Falcone had to say,

399
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:32,143
at least he confirmed the
existence of the Court.

400
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,212
So I take my uncle at his word?

401
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,479
You work the lead.

402
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,081
Check the docks. But that's just me.

403
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:39,483
I tend to give apocalyptic warnings

404
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:43,086
of mass destruction the
benefit of the doubt.

405
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,889
But it wasn't my father who was killed.

406
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:49,093
So if you want to go after
your uncle for what he did,

407
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,196
I got your back.

408
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,499
He says the Court has destroyed the city

409
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,301
twice before in its history.

410
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,202
We can't take that chance.

411
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:00,103
I'll call Judge Bam Bam, get a warrant.

412
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:02,607
We'll hit the docks and start
kicking in doors today.

413
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,176
No. He was very clear.
The Court can't know

414
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,578
I'm looking into this. The
GCPD cannot be involved.

415
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:10,047
So who do we know who can raid the docks

416
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:11,582
who won't raise questions

417
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:14,219
and isn't connected to the GCPD?

418
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:22,092
No. No, no, no, no, no.

far more than recall memories.

Pretending we are separate from it,

that is the falsehood.

Why would you show me that?

00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,588
- I can't tell you what I don't...
- What you don't know.

500
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:49,591
Yes, I've heard that one.

501
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:52,227
Now tell me something I haven't heard.

502
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,696
You don't know what they're capable of.

503
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,566
Even when Don Falcone
was running things,

504
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:01,035
he never asked questions
about what came into 9C.

505
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:03,605
In case you haven't heard,

506
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:07,841
Don Falcone ain't running things, baby.

507
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,111
- Now, what is coming...
- (groaning)

508
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:13,714
into dock 9C?

509
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:17,285
Something already came in last week,

510
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:19,287
- but they picked it up. Okay?
- Oh?

511
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,256
The crate, it's still over there.

512
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,125
I swear, that's all I know.

513
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,594
I swear.

514
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:30,130
So, you must have a phone number

515
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:33,033
to alert them when things arrive.

516
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:34,769
Huh? What do you say

517
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,338
we give 'em a little call?

518
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:41,009
'Cause I would love an introduction.

519
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,243
- (clang)
- (wings flapping)

520
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:57,125
- (metal blade ringing)
- (man screams)

521
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:14,308
Get him!

522
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,744
(automatic gunfire)

523
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,730
I-I swear,

524
00:27:35,762 --> 00:27:37,765
I didn't tell her nothin'!

525
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:44,405
GABE: Make sure you get
him from all sides.

526
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:48,076
Potential bidders need to know
that he's alive and well.

527
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:50,077
Once we get these delivered,

528
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,212
the auction can begin.

529
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:53,814
Forgot these in the car.

530
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,215
Cannolis from Alberto's, boss.

531
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:57,385
Thank God. I'm starved.

532
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:00,387
Alberto's are my favorite...

533
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:04,726
Looks like you got yourself
into quite the pickle.

534
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,227
You're sitting right next to me.

535
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,395
I think our fates are
somewhat intertwined.

536
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:10,298
Oh, no. I'll be fine.

537
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,900
What? What are you talking about?

538
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,735
Totally fine.

539
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,904
If you have a plan, tell me.

540
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:18,739
Tell me.

541
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,375
What? You want me to beg? Is that it?

542
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,309
I want you to be nice to me.

543
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:23,378
Nice to you?

544
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,913
Yes! Is that so much to ask?

545
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:26,246
No.

546
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,981
No, it's not.

547
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:30,217
Okay, I'll be nice. I promise.

548
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:32,253
Now, what is your plan?

549
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:33,254
Lay it on me.

550
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:36,257
Watch and learn.

551
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,159
Oh, yoo-hoo. Canolli guy.

552
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:40,962
Hey, quick question.

553
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:46,867
If I had information,

554
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:49,003
like, really good information

555
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:52,006
that would get you a ton
more money for Penguin,

556
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,974
would you let me go?

557
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,744
I don't know. Maybe.

558
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,912
What is it?

559
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,215
Oh, I can't tell you in front of...

560
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,785
Let me whisper it in your ear.

561
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:10,125
Do you like my perfume?

562
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,394
(inhales)

563
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:19,867
You'll do anything I ask?

564
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:22,303
Super.

565
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,270
Kill them all.

566
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,510
(gunshots)

567
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,376
Wait!

568
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,345
Stop!

569
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,079
Get his gun.

570
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:33,314
Grab the gun!

571
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,282
(chuckling)

572
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,818
Give it to me.

573
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:39,320
Give it to him!

574
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:40,789
And tell him to untie us.

575
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:41,856
Untie us!

576
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:42,856
You don't have to yell.

577
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:44,057
(giggles) Sorry.

578
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,026
I just got so caught up in the moment.

579
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,433
(gunshot)

580
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,336
You know,

581
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:58,338
I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.

582
00:29:58,372 --> 00:30:00,975
I think I'll auction you off to myself.

583
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,813
Piece by bloody piece.

584
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,816
(distant traffic sounds)

585
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,349
Carmine told us Jim came to him

586
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:12,520
asking questions about
his father's death.

587
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,521
What exactly does he know?

588
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:17,091
Only what Carmine knew.

589
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:19,928
That I gave the order
to have Peter killed.

590
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,964
Nothing can lead back to the Court.

591
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,500
After all these years,

592
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,535
why would he start
looking into this now?

593
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:32,473
I don't know. Believe me, this
is the last thing I wanted.

594
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,244
Which is why I'm here.

595
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:38,179
I know my nephew.

596
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,516
Jim won't stop until one of us is dead.

597
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,917
Unfortunate.

598
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:47,521
He would have made a powerful
ally in what lies ahead.

599
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,289
In that case,

600
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:51,359
you know what you have to do.

601
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:55,963
James Gordon must be killed.

602
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:03,906
- Barbara called.
- What'd she say?

603
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,773
Apparently, dock 9C is being guarded

604
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:08,510
by a blade-wielding psychopath
who almost killed them.

605
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,779
Of course it is. Did she find
out if anything was coming in?

606
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,180
That's the thing,

607
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:14,515
it already has.

608
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,053
I thought your uncle said the weapon
wasn't in the city yet. He did.

609
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,921
Which means either he's
lying or he didn't know.

610
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:21,956
Either way, we have to assume
the Court already has it.

611
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,526
- We still don't even know what "it" is.
- We know one thing.

612
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,194
Barbara said the crate that she saw

613
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:27,963
was stamped with Indian Hill.

614
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:30,064
So something from the freak factory

615
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,799
is gonna wipe out the city?

616
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:34,602
(phone buzzing)

617
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:41,809
Gordon.

618
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,212
FRANK: We need to talk.

619
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:45,546
Did you know the weapon is here?

620
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,814
What? No.

621
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:48,817
What the hell is going on, Frank?

622
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,818
We're running out of time.

623
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,985
I'm at my house.

624
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,721
Come alone and come quickly.

625
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,022
(phone clicks)

626
00:31:57,858 --> 00:32:00,128
(panting)

627
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:03,832
I trusted you, Gabe.

628
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:06,568
And how did you repay that loyalty?

629
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,236
Betrayal.

630
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,972
Not for nothing,

631
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:13,107
but I was there after
your mother was killed

632
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,843
when no one else was.

633
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,712
And how'd you repay me?

634
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,847
By passing me over.

635
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,116
Wow.

636
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,718
A valid point.

637
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:26,120
Perhaps we forget that loyalty

638
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:29,991
must be extended before
it can be returned.

639
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:31,993
Yeah.

640
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,863
You were loyal to me once, Gabe.

641
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:36,865
I wonder, could you be again?

642
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:39,001
Yes! Oh, boss.

643
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:43,004
I'd swear an oath on my dead
mother's grave right now.

644
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:44,606
God rest her soul.

645
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,741
No need for anything so dramatic.

646
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:49,610
Ivy, would you mind ensuring

647
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:53,549
that Gabe's oath of loyalty
is noble and true?

648
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,753
If what is what now?

649
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,756
Make him smell your perfume.

650
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,958
Right. Okay.

651
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,628
(sniffing)

652
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:10,299
Um, raise your right hand.

653
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:12,900
Do you swear

654
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:15,937
to be loyal and true to Penguin?

655
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,674
No.

656
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,776
Ouch.

657
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:24,847
I don't understand. Why not?
Why can't he be loyal?

658
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,815
Go ahead, answer.

659
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:30,318
I never was.

660
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:32,653
I only followed you out of fear.

661
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:34,655
We all did.

662
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:37,191
Actually, I can live with that.

663
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,928
Fear and respect... management 101.

664
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,664
No one ever respected you.

665
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:46,702
We always saw you for
what you really are.

666
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:50,204
A tiny freak who used
to hold an umbrella.

667
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,907
Nothing more.

668
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,644
A freak?

669
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,847
A... freak?

670
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,617
A<i> freak?!</i>

671
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:07,956
No!

672
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:08,490
A freak!

673
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,858
A freak! A<i> freak!</i>

674
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,226
(laughing)

675
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,695
(Oswald yelling, blows landing)

676
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:16,964
(yelling echoing)

677
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:18,766
(door closes)

678
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:29,378
Thanks for coming.

679
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:31,847
The weapon the Court is planning

680
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,717
to use on Gotham came from Indian Hill.

681
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,119
Any idea what it might be?

682
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,021
No.

683
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,724
Like I said, I had no idea
that it had already arrived.

684
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:46,328
It's clear that the Court
no longer trusts me.

685
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:51,934
Then why call me down here?

686
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,372
I'm supposed to kill you.

687
00:34:58,907 --> 00:35:02,277
Which leaves us... where?

688
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,146
That's up to you.

689
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,882
I need someone to replace
me on the Court.

690
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,184
Someone who can find
out what the weapon is

691
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:12,420
and how to stop it.

692
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,722
Someone I can trust.

693
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:19,761
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

694
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,896
It's the only way.

695
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,331
You just said they want me dead.

696
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:26,333
They still want you on the Court.

697
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,804
They just don't seen
now how it's possible,

698
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,905
but I do.

699
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:33,908
At some point, a woman named

700
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:35,777
Kathryn is going to call

701
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,212
to ask if you are dead.

702
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:40,782
And when she does,

703
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:43,217
I suggest you pick up.

704
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,453
And tell her what?

705
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,088
That you blame me for
your father's death.

706
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:48,956
I gave the order to have him killed,

707
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,324
and I deserved what I got.

708
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,060
What are you talking about?

709
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,328
You have his strength, Jim.

710
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,797
You can finish what he started.

711
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:59,334
For both of us.

712
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,471
He would have been so proud of you.

713
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:05,273
No!

714
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:14,680
(thud, door creaks and whirs open)

715
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,730
(Bruce grunts)

716
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,436
(Bruce groaning)

717
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:29,408
Please! Please. I'm sorry.

718
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,708
I'll do whatever you want.

719
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,744
Just please don't make me go back there!

720
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,087
Give me your money!

721
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,427
(groans, thuds)

722
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,629
(gasps)

723
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:03,774
No!

724
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,755
(grunting)

725
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:22,260
(wind whipping, grunts)

726
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:27,664
(yells)

727
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:30,701
(gasps)

728
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,639
(groans)

729
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,675
(panting)

730
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:44,414
(panting)

731
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:52,389
I have so much to teach you, Bruce.

732
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,492
But your pain...

733
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,662
it blocks you from who
I need you to become.

734
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:01,733
Who Gotham needs you to become.

735
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:07,671
(gasps loudly)

736
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,674
(panting)

737
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:22,943
If one's feelings and
emotions are strong enough,

738
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:28,218
their consequences can follow
you back into the real world.

739
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:32,463
I don't know what you want from me.

740
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:36,770
Over the centuries, we've
tried to end the cycle

741
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:39,873
of crime and violence
that plagues Gotham,

742
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:43,009
only for it to start up again.

743
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,212
And do you know why it does?

744
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:50,785
People are afraid.

745
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:56,056
And fear breeds hopelessness.

746
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:59,794
I'm supposed to believe you care
about the people of Gotham?

747
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:02,162
I do.

748
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:04,665
Very much.

749
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:07,634
Which is where you come in.

750
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,203
Gotham needs something I believe

751
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:13,574
only you can provide.

752
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:16,676
What?

753
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,615
A protector, Bruce.

754
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,819
I can't protect Gotham.

755
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,922
Not by myself. No one can.

756
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:29,790
Perhaps.

757
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,692
But if you were to become a symbol,

758
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:36,196
a symbol against fear,

759
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,134
then Gotham can be reborn.

760
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:50,845
Okay, I admit it.

761
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,713
I might have lost my
temper there a little bit.

762
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:55,882
Sorry about that.

763
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:58,084
It's okay.

764
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:01,355
I don't know why I let him get to me.

765
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:03,090
Sticks and stones, right?

766
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,825
Hmm.

767
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:08,028
Words always hurt me way
more than sticks or stones.

768
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:12,699
Yeah. Me, too.

769
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:16,169
So does this mean you're giving
up your plans for revenge?

770
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:19,840
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

771
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:21,976
and the rest of them by myself.

772
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,978
Who said anything about
taking them on by yourself?

773
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:27,113
Selina told me some pretty crazy stories

774
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:29,150
about people she met
down in Indian Hill.

775
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:32,018
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

776
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,887
Well,

777
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,025
what about an army of freaks?

778
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:43,364
What kind of freaks?

779
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:57,944
(phone ringing)

780
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:06,152
(phone beeps on)

781
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:08,288
Kathryn, I presume.

782
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:09,923
KATHRYN: Detective Gordon.

783
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,926
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

784
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,294
I killed my uncle.

785
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:15,029
I make no apologies for it.

786
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:16,429
We understand.

787
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:19,466
Good. Maybe it's time we meet.

788
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,902
Agreed.

789
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:24,471
(click, dial tone)
