1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,980
- Did something happen last Friday?
- I think that maybe... Jonas was with Ingrid.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,130
- You're lying! Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not lying!

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,260
Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,780
Last Friday?
Yes! Yes, I was with Jonas.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,540
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,300
I'm going to see William soon again. I really
think there could be something between us.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,760
The thing is that Ingrid's brother is dealing.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,600
I trust you 100%.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,850
SHAME

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,420
MONDAY, 11:32 A.M.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,550
First there's Lord of Ringnes,
instead of Lord of the Rings.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,420
Then we have the Lion Kink,
because you could have sex in the woods...

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,280
But I'm not going to do that!

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
Or, instead of the Hunger Games,
we'll say the Thirst Games.

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,860
The Thirst Games! Because we drink.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,610
And we don't drink Pepsi Max,
to put it like that.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,540
No, we're doing Smirnoff Light here.

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,630
Did you know Diet Coke won
in that Pepsi Max versus Coke test?

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,820
So Pepsi Max
really isn't that great. It's not!

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,860
No!

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,790
What are you doing on your plate, Vilde?

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,050
- I'm just sorting my salad.
- I don't think you can sort it more than that.

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,140
When are we going to talk about what
happened at the Halloween party? That...

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,420
- William and Sara hooked up.
- What about it?

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,300
Were you upset?

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,830
No, dear God. It was a hook-up party.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,790
Everyone hooked up with each other.
Not just William and Sara.

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,490
Penetrator Henrik
hooked up with Frida from 1STE.

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,260
Felix and Malin in 2NBH did it.

30
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,100
Borkis hooked up with Elise from 1STB.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,160
And... Chris hooked up with someone.
And then there's William and Sara.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,860
- Chris, who did you hook up with?
- No, not her. Penetrator Chris.

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,670
Oh!

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,180
Who... who did he hook up with?

35
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,370
I don't know.
I just heard he hooked up with someone.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,630
- Hey.
- Hi.

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,910
What's up?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,080
- What are you doing today?
- I don't know, I thought I'd go skate.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,380
- Can I come? And watch?
- Yeah... watch? When did you get into that?

40
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,620
I feel like being with you.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,000
But I have to go now. We'll talk later.

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,180
- Love you!
- Yeah, you too.

43
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,060
Question.

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,900
Is that Isak guy available?

45
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,580
Yeah. Why?

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,590
No, I felt some "electric chemistry"
going on there.

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,980
Some really hot vibes between us.

48
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,860
Seriously.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,530
MONDAY, 2:40 P.M.

50
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,750
I see it's going better
between you and Jonas.

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,000
Yep!

52
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,350
You...

53
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,070
you don't want to say why?

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,800
No, we just... talked some stuff out.

55
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,460
- I fucked up badly.
- What?

56
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,400
What did you do?

57
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,050
Isak...

58
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,260
If I tell you this, you have to promise
not to say anything to Jonas.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,310
Okay, I promise.

60
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,430
Seriously.

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
You could ruin our relationship if you do.

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm not going to tell anyone, okay?

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,610
You can trust me.

64
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,510
What did you do?

65
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,400
You know...

66
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,170
how I thought there was something
between Ingrid and Jonas?

67
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,350
So I asked Ingrid if they had been together.

68
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
And they had been.

69
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,760
- Seriously?
- But there was a reason for it.

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
It's just that...

71
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,610
Ingrid didn't tell me that.

72
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,100
So I got really pissed.
And sad, so...

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
So...

74
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,450
I...

75
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,580
I hooked up with Chris.

76
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,120
You hooked up with Chris?!

77
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,970
- The girl who keeps eye-fucking me?
- No, no!

78
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,110
Chris from the third year. Christoffer.

79
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,940
- So you hooked up with a third-year?
- Yes! Fuck! I'm the worst...

80
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,650
But...

81
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,820
you just made out a bit, right?
Nothing more happened?

82
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,700
No, no.

83
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
It would have...

84
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,940
it would have been worse
if it wasn't just hooking up.

85
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,580
If it had meant something to you.
But it didn't...

86
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,040
you were just angry.

87
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,440
Yeah...

88
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,870
It just feels shitty not telling Jonas.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
Honestly, Eva...

90
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,840
If I had a girlfriend, who had hooked up with
someone else,

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,390
then I wouldn't want to know.

92
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,870
Things like that fuck up relationships.

93
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,490
You don't have to tell him,
because it didn't mean anything.

94
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,240
No...

95
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,260
Besides, you seem more in love with him now
than before. Maybe it was a good thing?

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
So...

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,700
It was just a little hook-up, right?

98
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,310
It'll be fine...

99
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,550
but make sure no one finds out, right?

100
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,950
That no one else will tell.

101
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,730
Especially not that Chris
you hooked up with, right?

102
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,530
It'll be fine.

103
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,650
Thanks.

104
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,350
For what?

105
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
You're a good guy.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,820
TUESDAY, 1:40 P.M.

107
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,580
- Vilde!
- Hi!

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,810
Hey...

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,850
I have to ask you something.

110
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,300
Yesterday you said Chris hooked up with someone
at the Halloween party.

111
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,150
What do you know about it? Just asking.

112
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,020
No, I just heard he hooked up with someone.

113
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,700
Okay... who said that?

114
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,540
- Or was it Robin who hooked up with someone?
- Robin?

115
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,080
Yeah, now that I think about it, it was Robin.
Chris has a girlfriend.

116
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah, okay.

117
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,140
- Do you like him?
- Huh? No, no!

118
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,110
It would be so perfect if I got together
with William, and you with Chris.

119
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,660
Vilde, seriously?!

120
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,330
It was just a suggestion, if she felt like it...

121
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,520
You can't walk around in that sweater,
thinking you'll be together with William.

122
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,430
Come here.

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,950
You see that girl over there?

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,940
She has slept with William.

125
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,640
See her over there?

126
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,610
She's also slept with William.

127
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,530
And there's one.

128
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,400
And there.

129
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,220
And one up there.

130
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,900
You can't know
if all those girls slept with William!

131
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,160
- There's a lot of guys on their bus.
- Vilde, it's marked on your sweater.

132
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,300
The one you've slept with
is marked in red, get it?

133
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,900
You're just walking around
like some living trophy now.

134
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,160
You have to forget William!

135
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,740
Give him back the sweater,
and take back your integrity!

136
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,960
Hey...

137
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,680
he's the loser, not you.

138
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,700
I know you're supposed to think that
if a guy doesn't like you,

139
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,520
something's wrong with him, not you.

140
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,660
But how do you think like that?

141
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,780
I always think that
there's something wrong with me.

142
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,190
WEDNESDAY, 6:40 P.M.

143
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
Hello?

144
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,260
- Hi.
- Hey.

145
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,600
To Chris Penetrator:

146
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,600
Sorry, low battery,
didn't mean to hang up,
call you afterwards.

147
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,750
What are you doing here?

148
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,420
What do you mean by that?

149
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,490
Hi.

150
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,620
- Hey.
- You good?

151
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,420
Yeah, I'm fine. What about you?

152
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,430
Good. I was reading.

153
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,930
Yeah, what?

154
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,610
Elle.

155
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,750
Are you going to get that, or?

156
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah!

157
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,650
- Hallo?
- You're such a damn stalker!

158
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,120
Hi, mom! I can't talk right now.
I've got someone visiting.

159
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,100
"Mom"?! What kind of sick game are you playing?

160
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,990
- I'll call you afterwards, okay?
- "Okay, my girl! We'll talk later. Kiss, kiss!"

161
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,300
- Okay, bye!
- Hey, wait, one more thing.

162
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,560
- "Have you done your homework?"
- Bye!

163
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
- Was that your mom?
- Yeah!

164
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,100
"Someone visiting"?

165
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,490
It's REALLY important
that you shut up about
what happened on
Halloween, ok?

166
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,180
Have you still not told her we're together?

167
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,540
You had the chance to meet my mom,

168
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,480
but you'd rather smoke marijuana
with Ingrid's brother.

169
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,830
So, look who's talking.

170
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,320
- What?
- It's so cute that you call it "marijuana".

171
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll keep my mouth shut.
No worries.

172
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,680
What's cute about that,
isn't that what it's called?

173
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,930
Yeah...

174
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,680
- But...
- But?

175
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Only old people call it that.

176
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,130
- Old people?! I'm a bit older than you.
- Yeah...

177
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,250
- A bit smarter.
- No...

178
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,460
- What do you call drugs?
- "Drugs"...

179
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,020
I don't know. We just call it weed or something.

180
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,790
But it's the same...

181
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
- Yes.
- ...and it's not good for you.

182
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,960
See, you're really distant now.
Hello? Can you see me?

183
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,890
See how distant I am, can't see you!

184
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,950
I'm a junkie... yeah, then you're an alcoholic,
because you've tried alcohol.

185
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,600
You can't compare those!

186
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,730
- You'd need to drink a lot!
- That's what you're saying!

187
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,200
- Fine, I'm a junkie for trying it a few times.
- A few times?!

188
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,230
- How many times has it really been?
- I don't know.

189
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,390
- Are you awake all night?
- No.

190
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,370
- Can't you stop for my sake?
- Sure, I can do anything for your sake.

191
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,210
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

192
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,940
But...

193
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,760
THURSDAY, 1:20 P.M.

194
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,530
You can't buy pink Uggs!

195
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,350
- Of course I can!
- Uggs in general.

196
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,620
- Why not?
- They're super comfortable, though.

197
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,350
- They're slippers!
- They look insanely ugly.

198
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,030
I've decided on what I'm
going to say to William.

199
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,220
Say?

200
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,220
- What are you talking about?
- My integrity.

201
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,660
You don't have any. Next subject.

202
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,300
- What are you going to say?
- I'll say that I won't be treated like this.

203
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,270
- Huh?!
- And then, I'll return the sweater.

204
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,150
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

205
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,890
We're finally in with the Penetrator guys,
and now you're going to fuck everything up?

206
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,700
Says you, who ruined it for all of us the
first time we were invited to a bus pre-party.

207
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,300
There was a good reason.

208
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,860
Sana, it's good that Vilde will explain to
William that she will not be treated like crap.

209
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,680
She can't tell him! It won't work.
It's better to be completely cool.

210
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,010
It's possible to be cool and speak up.

211
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,060
There he is.

212
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,400
- You're not going to say it now?!
- I am.

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,130
- Not now, he's with his friends.
- I don't give a shit who he's with!

214
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
- Hi!
- Hi?

215
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,510
I just wanted to say that if you thought
I would walk around like some living trophy,

216
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,200
you're terribly wrong.

217
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,020
Don't play dumb! You know what I mean,
half the girls are walking around--

218
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,580
Sorry, what's your name again?

219
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,340
Vilde.

220
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,380
Okay, Vilde. Take a deep breath.

221
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,280
I think there's been some kind
of misunderstanding here.

222
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
It's probably my fault.

223
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,670
But if you think I see you like
some kind of trophy, you're wrong.

224
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,910
Because you're not pretty enough for that.

225
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,940
- What an awesome guy you are!
- Who are you?

226
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:26,010
I'm so curious as to what happened to you,
to make you have such an inferiority complex

227
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,650
that you have to piss on the feelings
of a tiny first-year girl in order to feel cool?

228
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,710
Were you never validated as a child,
is that it?

229
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Mommy was never proud of your drawings?

230
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,090
Or was it daddy,

231
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,040
who never came to
any of your graduations?

232
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,630
You didn't have hair on your dick
in the 7th grade and got bullied for it?

233
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Whatever it is, you seriously have to get over it
and start behaving like a decent human being.

234
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,620
Stop walking around like a fucking cliché.

235
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,390
FRIDAY, 2:02 P.M.

236
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,220
I have to go to Norwegian class.

237
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,580
- No...
- I have to!

238
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,380
Yeah. But seriously, I really have to go.

239
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
I've been late way too many times.

240
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Talk to you later.

241
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,500
- Fucking hell, you were so awesome yesterday.
- Yeah, that was legendary.

242
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,570
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm completely over William.

243
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,830
Good.

244
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,990
Anyway, nobody cares about me and William.
Everyone's talking about that rumor about Chris.

245
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,380
What rumor about Chris?

246
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,320
Chris hooked up with someone at the Halloween
party, his girlfriend found out and went psycho!

247
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,290
But you told me it wasn't Chris!

248
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,190
Chris hooked up with someone
at the party.

249
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,420
I saw it.

250
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,870
You saw it?

251
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,600
Yeah, on the stairs.

252
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
On the stairs?

253
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,770
You fucking whore!
