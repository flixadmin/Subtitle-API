1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,396
Give me your hand.

2
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,568
Did you cut it?

3
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,903
You try to kill yourself, huh?

4
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,406
I heard you named me in your suicide note.

5
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,033
You said you can't go on because of me.

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,286
-What a disrespectful loser.
-You motherfucker.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,788
If you transfer afterwards,
how does that make me look?

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,332
-Have I ever fucking hit you, huh?
-No, never.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,002
No, right? That's right.

11
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,712
He's all yours.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,471
There.

13
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,473
You asshole! You asshole!

14
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,932
-Hit me back, asshole.
-No, wait.

15
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,980
-Please, stop.
-Hey.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,190
-Stop.
-Hey!

17
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,816
Just fucking stop!

18
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,824
You psycho.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,998
Get up. You bastard!

20
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,046
-Hey, you splash me!
-Shit!

21
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,051
Are you out
of your fucking mind, man?

22
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,769
Asshole.

23
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,021
Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

24
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,564
Motherfucker!

25
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,279
Fuck.

26
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,670
All right. Knock it off.

27
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,132
Let's go. Come on, we're out of here.

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,931
You fucker.

29
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,558
Get him off!

30
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,227
Cut it out already.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,855
Come on.

32
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,037
What? You scared?

33
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,249
Not at all. I'm not scared.

34
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,709
Yeah, whatever.

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,508
Shit.

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,136
His BP is okay, but he's drowsy.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,722
He has severe edema
in the back of his head

38
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,017
and tenderness in his left thorax
so I say TBI and abdominal bleeding.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,519
I'll transfer him right away
for emergency surgery.

40
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,397
If he isn't in surgery within an hour,
he'll be DOA no question.

41
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,274
Yes.

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,735
We'll intubate him,
put in a c-line, then send him over.

43
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,361
Yeah.

44
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,113
Okay.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,201
What the hell is taking them so long?
I called two hours ago.

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,454
RESTRICTED AREA

47
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,428
Dad.

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,973
Are they okay?

49
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,144
-Huh?
-I'm sorry, Dad.

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,437
I knew it wasn't right,

51
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,148
but I wanted to kill them.

52
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,861
It'll never happen again, Dad.

53
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,280
It's okay.

54
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,115
Do you mean that, Dad?

55
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,659
It'll all be okay, son.

56
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,494
What's gonna be okay, huh?

57
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,703
Everything.

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,249
All of it.

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,668
Has anything gotten better?

60
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,338
Just answer me.

61
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,424
Has anything gotten better, Dad?

62
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,052
Either I die…

63
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,887
…or they die.

64
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,931
It won't get better until someone dies.

65
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,395
Jin-su.

66
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,896
Stop!

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,482
I'm gonna kill them all.

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,611
Stop it, Jin-su.

69
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,196
No!

70
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,034
Jin-su. I'll fix everything,
just stop, okay? Jin-su.

71
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,202
Do you wanna die, Dad?

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,830
Should I kill you?

73
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,124
Son, you need to stop it!

74
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm sorry, Jin-su.

75
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,366
HOLY BIBLE

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,784
I love you.

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,211
Jin-su.

78
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
Tag. I got you.

79
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
TEACHER'S OFFICE

80
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,331
Over here.

81
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,792
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi, how are you?

82
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,883
-Ms. Jung. I'm heading out, okay?
-See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,384
-Okay. See you.
-Bye.

84
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,681
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Keep up the good work

85
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,475
and don't forget your homework, alright?

86
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,612
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

87
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>The seemingly never-ending heat</i>
<i>has finally died down.</i>

88
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:15,328
<i>And the muggy, scorching weather</i>
<i>has been replaced by a fresh, cool breeze.</i>

89
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,123
Today, our topic
is a fascinating study from abroad.

90
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,502
A psychologist in the US
conducted an experiment.

91
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,546
He gathered 48 men and women
who had never met.

92
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,923
To one group, he gave a specific…

93
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,056
Well, maybe next time
you should learn how to pass the ball.

94
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,265
Whoa, look out.

95
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,975
Hey.

96
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

97
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,648
I don't know about that.

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,069
Where are you going? Wait up!

99
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,405
What the…

100
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,491
Idiot. Come here.

101
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,373
WE ROOT FOR
THE HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL ARCHERY TEAM

102
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,443
Let's go
get <i>tteokbokki</i> later.

103
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,571
Shouldn't we
wake up Hyeon-ju?

104
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,322
But it's so yummy.

105
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
Oh, she's just fine.

106
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,125
Ah, shit! I told them to wake me up.

107
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,696
What the?

108
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,884
Hey.

109
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,056
Hey.

110
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,683
Come here.

111
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,852
Where are you going?

112
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,647
Damn it. Won't listen.

113
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,440
Hey.

114
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,318
Hey.

115
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,904
Hey.

116
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,365
Oh…

117
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,868
What the hell? You bastard.

118
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,095
What are you doing?

119
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,724
Nothing. It bit me. I'm pissed.

120
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,475
Goodbye.

121
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,824
So the restaurant moved?
How about a grand opening?

122
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,117
But we're not doing one.

123
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,994
What? What…

124
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,537
{\an8}CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

125
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,873
Seriously? I told them to change the name.

126
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,124
What about the old name?

127
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,710
We're not doing it.
The fryer hasn't even come in yet.

128
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,628
I heard there'll be one.

129
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,839
MOM: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
CHEONG-SAN: CAN YOU NOT USE MY NAME?

130
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,966
I mean, I would know better than you,
don't you think?

131
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,384
MOM: OKAY. SO WHICH ONE?
CHEONG-SAN: MOM…

132
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,094
My mom's the worst.

133
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,639
{\an8}-Hey.
-Damn, my phone!

134
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,974
You can't run away.

135
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,186
Hey, gopher. Let's get some chicken.

136
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,479
But we're not open yet.

137
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,563
Sure you are.

138
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,523
Your mom says she's testing out
a new recipe today.

139
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,525
You're going, right?

140
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,735
Of course.

141
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,447
-Are you going too?
-Mm. Yes.

142
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,948
I mean your mom told On-jo
to bring her friends.

143
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,742
Uh, so, is this a double date?

144
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,494
What the hell?

145
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,455
-Weird, we're not open today.
-Cool.

146
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,624
Uh, what do you know?
Let's get out of here.

147
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,672
-You like chicken that much?
-Oh, you bet.

148
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,799
I'm gonna eat two whole ones.

149
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,388
Looks great. Thank you.

150
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,515
-Thanks a lot.
-It looks so good.

151
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,641
-Why'd you bring out so much?
-Oh, yes.

152
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,434
Remember On-jo eats a lot.

153
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,811
I don't eat a lot.

154
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,728
I just eat well.

155
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, yes, sure. That's what I like to hear.

156
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,940
Eat up, Gyeong-su.

157
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,942
-Yep.
-You too, A-sak.

158
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,986
It's I-sak, not A-sak.

159
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,154
You change your name?

160
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,993
Mom. If you wanna change names,
you should start with the restaurant.

161
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,036
Why are you using my name?

162
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,831
I named it Cheongsan Chicken
way before you were born.

163
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,834
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

164
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,252
-Hey. Ah…
-I don't like--

165
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,545
Quiet. Okay.

166
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,921
I really like it. Sounds like a tradition.

167
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,422
-Yeah?
-Of course.

168
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
He's right.

169
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,053
Look, so this is a new recipe
we just came up with.

170
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,557
So this one is just a little spicy,
and this one's really hot.

171
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,392
What do you think?

172
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,185
You can be totally honest with me.

173
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,730
It's super crazy mad good.

174
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,899
It's delicious.

175
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
-Really?
-Oh, ma'am, look.

176
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,613
If you ever need a delivery boy,
I'll work for cheap.

177
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,532
You guys need to study.

178
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,326
On-jo. Is it too hot?

179
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,787
It's salty.

180
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,163
Yeah?

181
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,081
Oh…

182
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,876
How about this one? Is it spicy?

183
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,752
No. It's salty.

184
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,171
Wait a sec. That's not…

185
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,339
Uhm, honey!

186
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
-Yeah?
-She says it's salty.

187
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,093
It's salty?

188
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,137
-On-jo says it's salty.
-Wait, I…

189
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,555
-It can't be.
-It's good.

190
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,682
-Maybe you left…
-I don't think it's salty at all.

191
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,434
-Yeah, it's good.
-It tastes good to me.

192
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,810
Let me see.

193
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,562
Stop eating. It's salty.

194
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,106
It still tastes good.

195
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,527
Ah.

196
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,197
Did you hear our science teacher?

197
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,491
What about him?

198
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,076
Well, he smells like a rotting corpse.

199
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,787
Oh, Na-yeon spread that rumor, right?

200
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,997
It's true.

201
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,249
He was absent after his son went missing.

202
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,584
But then he came into class…

203
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,297
Oh!

204
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,217
<i>…she said</i>
<i>he smelled like a corpse.</i>

205
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,303
<i>How does she know</i>
<i>what a corpse smells like?</i>

206
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,679
<i>Has she smelled one before?</i>

207
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,642
I swear she knows every other smell
except that one.

208
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,770
Since she never smelled it before,
it has to be a rotting corpse.

209
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,272
When his son went missing,
he started acting weird.

210
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,440
He was an outcast.

211
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,234
I heard he got bullied all the time.

212
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,654
Mm-hm. It sucks.

213
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,614
I feel really bad for Mr. Lee.

214
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,909
Remember last week
when he just left class?

215
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,418
BETWEEN TISSUE CELLS

00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,214
CELLULAR RESPIRATION

217
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,864
Did the bells ring?

218
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,118
<i>He's never done that before.</i>

219
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,870
They say he was a genius.

220
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,580
Lots of geniuses go crazy.

221
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,251
Well, at least you won't have
to worry about going crazy.

222
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,130
Hey. Are you talking trash?

223
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,382
-I'm so full.
-Come on. Hurry up.

224
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,342
We're late anyway.

225
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,593
Cheong-san, hold on.

226
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,348
Why? We're late.
And I have a music test.

227
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,183
I just need to ask you something.

228
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,852
What is it?

229
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,645
-Nothing.
-What?

230
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,939
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

231
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,441
What is it?

232
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,577
Is this better like this?

233
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,412
Or like this?

234
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,165
Look close.

235
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,667
Like this? Or Like this?

236
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,131
This way, right?

237
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,021
Get lost.

238
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,661
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

241
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,882
Do exams start next week?

242
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,427
You always bring up tests when I'm eating.

243
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,388
When else should I ask?

244
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,306
Wait a minute.
We have to finish the sprouts.

245
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,851
All right?

246
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,857
I mean, you're not gonna get
good grades anyway.

247
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,401
No point in stressing about it.

248
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,863
Don't give up on me, Dad. I can do it.

249
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,531
I'm not giving up.

250
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,657
Just no expectations.

251
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,076
That's giving up.

252
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,704
Is these from Cheong-san's?

253
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,622
Mmm.

254
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,291
Two days ago…

255
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,589
…there was an accident by a tollgate,
so I went to the scene,

256
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,216
and whether you're rich or poor,
got good grades or bad ones,

257
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,427
everyone's equal in an accident.

258
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,345
Grades are not that important.

259
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,515
Being healthy and safe.
That's all that really matters.

260
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,977
I mean it.
I can make it into tier five this time.

261
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,812
Don't push yourself.

262
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,107
Then I'll make it into tier six, okay?

263
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,568
You shouldn't lie to your dad. Here, eat.

264
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,696
It's salty but tasty.

265
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,082
It's Cheong-san.

266
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,292
Always on time.

267
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
Bye, Dad.

268
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,296
Hey, have another bite, okay?

269
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,214
Hey, kid!

270
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,381
Are you okay?

271
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,760
That punk.

272
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,057
Come on. She basically
didn't eat anything at all.

273
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,519
Guess I should start
with her leftovers, huh.

274
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,357
-Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, shoot!
-One, two, shoot!

275
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,487
One, two, shoot!
One, two, shoot! One, two, shoot!

276
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,155
Yeah!

277
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,741
Yes!

278
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,786
I'm seriously going to kill you now.

279
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,290
Hey, On-jo!

280
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,250
Nam On-jo!

281
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,096
Play fair, you punk.

282
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,474
God, I'm spent.

283
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,393
Carry it.

284
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,022
But look at this.
I got hurt making breakfast.

285
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,944
Let's go, gopher.

286
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,578
Nam-ra.

287
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,164
Class president!

288
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,670
Hey, hey! Hurry up!

-I'm going first!
-Hold up!

291
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,636
Hey, kids!

292
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,179
-Bye.
-Okay.

293
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,559
Hey, kids! You get back here!

294
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,478
Hey you!
You live in the rental apartments.

295
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,522
Hey! You punks!

296
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,483
Hey!

297
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,860
Hello.

298
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,029
See you later!

299
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,947
Wait for me! Shit!

300
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,366
That fucking shithead.

301
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,916
Ji-min!

302
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,294
Share this with your friends
at choir, will you?

303
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,420
I said I don't want it.

304
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,047
Boy, oh, boy.

305
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,133
She skipped breakfast as well.

306
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,954
-Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
-Hurry. Hurry, hurry!

307
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,165
-Wake up five minutes earlier, okay?
-All right, that's it!

308
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,834
Stop right there! Stop, stop, stop!

309
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,545
Put your names down.

310
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,216
Let's see.
One, two, three, four,

311
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,134
five, six, seven, eight.

312
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,427
You have been chosen.

313
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,137
-Please, sir.
-You get three demerits each.

314
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,680
You three are always late.

315
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,352
Get moving.

316
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,951
Hey.

317
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,663
Is it my fault
that idiot Jin-su went missing, huh?

318
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,914
That's not it.

319
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,042
Then why the hell did you decide
to tattle on me, you little prick?

320
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,795
The teacher said
to write down everything we knew.

321
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,171
And what do you know, huh?

322
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,215
Asshole.

323
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,134
Seriously, what the hell do you know?

324
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,095
You're just
freaking unbelievable.

325
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,930
Hey. Go ahead.

326
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,600
Over here. Huh?

327
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,728
Where you looking at, huh?

328
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,606
Uh, fuck!

329
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,944
It's okay. Take it off.

330
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,196
-Hands off.
-Don't you dare move.

331
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,324
Stay still, yeah?

NEW CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

334
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,378
You perverted freak.

335
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,297
You like it?

336
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,718
Hey.

337
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,053
The video.

338
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,766
You asshole.

339
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,521
Go on.

340
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,524
Just press record.

341
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,820
-You wanna die, asshole?
-That's enough.

342
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,449
Stop.

343
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,545
Shit. Son of a bitch.

344
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,134
We're not playing around, you moron.

345
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,515
You used to party with us.

346
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,600
Don't act all holier-than-thou,
you hear me?

347
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,143
Fuck off.

348
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,853
You need to grow up.

349
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,734
Get outta here.

350
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
Go ahead.

351
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,367
You might be safe.

352
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,875
Move.

353
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,295
You always gonna be like this?

354
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,424
Go.

355
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,262
You look really sexy in this.

356
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,681
Should I send it to your mom?

357
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,059
You know I'm friends with her on Facebook.

358
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,314
What kind of weirdo
makes friends with an old lady?

359
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,777
I can't go.

360
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,029
It's okay. You can do it.

361
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,575
It's not okay.

362
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,411
Because if I leave now…

363
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,831
it'll be worst tomorrow.

364
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,304
Take it off.

365
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,514
Should I do it for you?

366
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,936
Hurry up, jeez.

367
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,780
-Su-hyeok.
-Hey. Morning.

368
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,837
What?

369
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,839
If you have time,
come to the roof after lunch.

370
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,967
Why? I don't fight anymore.

371
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,345
You think I'd wanna fight you?

372
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,429
Then why?

373
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,723
See you later.

374
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,192
Weird.

375
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,403
Are you changing?

376
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,822
-Give back my ball.
-Seriously.

377
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,825
-You have some water?
-Mine's too warm.

378
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,993
Let me have some.

379
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,703
-Have you heard her…
-I can't hear anything at all actually.

380
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,206
-Are you an idiot?
-Do you hear the song?

381
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,083
Hey, you lost me big-time yesterday.

382
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,876
-Hey.
-No, it's all because of the keyboard!

383
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,378
-I go there all the time.
-Yeah, definitely the keyboard.

384
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,214
-Because the lady who works there is cute.
-I'm telling you, dude

385
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,465
I gave you a head start.

386
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,092
-What are you talking about?
-I said I'd beat you, right?

387
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,927
That's not true.

388
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,970
Gyeong-su beat you, right?

389
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,055
That's bullshit!

390
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,306
What do I do?

391
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,391
Don't bullshit me.

392
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,809
-What?
-I'm serious.

393
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,060
I don't know.

394
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,231
-What do I do?
-Wait. What? Why?

395
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,524
I don't know.

396
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,277
-I'm gonna tell you later.
-Tell me what?

397
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,572
-Uh, It's my crappy keyboard.
-Huh?

398
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,991
-Oh, your keyboard is better than mine.
-That's bullshit.

399
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,951
Sleeping beauty.

400
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,994
-Su-hyeok.
-I smell your feet from here.

401
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,455
This jerk didn't wear socks.

402
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,582
-Hey, hey, hey.
-It's not okay.

403
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,042
-Take him out. Come on.
-Hey.

404
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,335
-Hey.
-Really?

405
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,295
-That's ridiculous.
-Hey, seriously.

406
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,048
-What's the name? Paulo?
-Give me a break.

407
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,967
-Let's break his leg.
-Go ahead.

408
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,760
-Hey!
-Then I'll break his fingers.

409
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,595
Whoa. What the fuck.

410
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,180
Get off of there. You stink.

411
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,932
Oh, okay. My bad.

412
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,018
What's the big deal? Sorry.

413
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,770
Cut it out! You're so dirty.

414
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,771
Hey, what the hell?

415
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,231
Hey, just let it go.

416
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,190
What the hell is your problem?

417
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,191
What I do, huh?

418
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,526
What I do that was so wrong?

419
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,403
-Tell me what I do.
-Hey, you punks.

420
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,739
Come on guys. Take your seats.
Come on, move it.

421
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,782
Attention!

422
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,076
Hi, there.

423
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,578
Hello!

424
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,996
Hi. Good morning.

425
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,498
Time to hand-in your phones.

426
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,462
Who's in touch with Hyeon-ju?

427
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,507
Nobody?

428
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,967
So none of you have tried
calling her today?

429
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,928
Uh, we cleaned the science lab

430
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,182
together yesterday,
but I haven't seen her since.

431
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:29,893
Okay.

432
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,771
If anyone hears from her
some time the next few days,

433
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,522
let me know right away, okay?

434
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,524
Okay.

435
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,487
Exams start next week,
so get your acts together.

436
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,738
Hey, your phone.

437
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,744
Hey, uh…

438
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,954
I heard that.

439
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,914
Why didn't you silence it?

440
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,873
One more time.

441
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,208
Hand over your phones, please.

442
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,544
-Dae-su. Seriously?
-You idiot.

443
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,421
How stupid is he?

444
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,800
Why is it so much fun to mess with him?

445
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,801
Huh?

446
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,308
What you gonna do about it?

447
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,476
On-jo.

448
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,437
This is your phone from last year.

449
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,815
Take it, please.

450
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,693
Take it now.

451
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,031
Uh, hello, Mr. Lee.

452
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,616
-Uh, hello there.
-Hi.

453
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,744
Uh, you know Kim Hyeon-ju from my class?

454
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,287
She didn't make it home last night.

455
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,247
And…

456
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,998
The kids haven't seen her

457
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,834
since she was cleaning
the science lab yesterday.

458
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh, really?

459
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,464
Do you remember seeing her by any chance?

460
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,551
No, I haven't.

461
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,470
Uh, so yesterday you went home

462
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,264
without stopping by
the science lab, right?

463
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,182
That's what I told you.

464
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,518
I…

465
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,894
…I'm sorry.

466
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,439
Apparently, no one seen her
since she was in here, so…

467
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,154
Is someone in there?

468
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,533
Yeah.

469
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,994
It's just a hamster.

470
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,290
-Oh…
-I should probably get ready for class.

471
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,791
Oh, okay.

472
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,668
-Thanks.
-Hmm.

473
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,385
SUPPLY ROOM

474
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,606
A student was bit by the hamster.

475
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,318
I injected her with benzodiazepine…

476
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,699
It's only slowing down the infection

477
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,118
by a few hours…

478
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,694
Don't kill me.

479
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,205
Don't kill you?

480
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,381
Don't bother having any hope.

481
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,641
<i>A virus…</i>

482
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,690
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

483
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,652
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

484
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,866
Everything that evolves in this manner

485
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,037
should be considered
an independent living organism.

486
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,458
Mr. Lee, the textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

487
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,461
Whether or not it's categorized that way

488
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,423
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

489
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,885
If its will is so strong…

490
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,724
{\an8}I'M SO SEXY

491
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,856
The instinct to survive
actually surpasses intelligence.

492
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,277
And eventually the ecosystem
is dominated by that will.

493
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,655
Humanity has never once
completely defeated a virus.

494
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,369
<i>Leucochloridium paradoxum.</i>

495
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,540
This parasite's
final destination is a bird.

496
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,671
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its ocular tentacles.

497
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,383
That makes the snail put itself
in the path of predatory birds.

498
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,763
So the infected snail commits suicide
at the whim of the parasite.

499
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,558
Tell me.

500
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,979
Now, is that because the snail
is less intelligent?

501
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,942
It's not.

502
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,780
It's because
the parasite's will to survive

503
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,490
is much stronger than the snail's.

504
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,701
-Shut up when the teacher's talking.
-The evolving…

505
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,912
…and hereditary will to survive is…

506
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,954
Keep your head up.

507
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,501
…the sole standard by which
living organisms are defined.

508
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,378
So is the textbook wrong?

509
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,717
The textbook?

510
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,389
It's wrong.

511
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,702
In fact, none of us
are completely free from prejudice.

512
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,664
We all have
preconceived ideas about others.

513
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,376
Here, "free from" means
the lacking in or unincumbered by.

514
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,254
Anyone want to interpret this?

515
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,341
Okay.

516
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,676
Hee-su.

517
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,554
I need to use the bathroom.

518
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,013
Okay, go.

519
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,476
Okay, then.

520
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,728
Anyone wanna have a crack at it, huh?

521
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,565
Class president?

522
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,195
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

523
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,574
We all have preconceptions
about other people.

524
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,617
Hmm, okay. Nice.

525
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,287
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

526
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,664
Stand up.

527
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,082
Yes?

528
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,500
What's with "Bare-su"?

529
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,960
Mm…

530
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,462
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

531
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,797
Ah.

532
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,466
He hates wearing socks.
He's so weird about it.

533
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,178
I can smell it a mile away.

534
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,015
Okay, Bare-su.

535
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,808
What did Nam-ra say a minute ago?

536
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,811
Ah…

537
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,230
Ah…

538
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,693
She was absolutely correct.
A hundred percent.

539
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,156
What was her absolutely correct
answer then?

540
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,991
Hmm…

541
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,952
All right…

542
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,788
Huh?

543
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,292
Hyeon-ju.

544
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,502
Hey, Hyeon-ju.

545
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,962
Hyeon-ju!

546
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,048
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

547
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,634
-Hey, Hyeon-ju.
-Is that blood?

548
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,885
Ms. Park.

549
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,429
Yeah, it's me. Do you recognize me?

550
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,014
He grabbed me…

551
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,101
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

552
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,561
He locked you up?

553
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,771
The science teacher?

554
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,731
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan, huh?

555
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
He tied me up…

556
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,151
I told you, didn't I?

557
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,486
Just shut up, okay?

558
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,154
Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

559
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,989
-What kind of a psycho does this?
-Nam-ra.

560
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,366
Make sure
they study on their own.

561
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,452
And please don't say anything to anyone
until I come back and confirm the facts.

562
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,163
Hyeon-ju. Can you get up?

563
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,081
I'll carry her.

564
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,499
Okay.

565
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,626
-Can someone help him out, please.
-Here.

566
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,710
-Good.
-Okay.

567
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,421
Go back to your seats!

568
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,506
Now.

569
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,224
-Hyeon-ju.
-What's wrong?

570
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,558
Guys, hold her still.

571
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,063
What's wrong with her?

572
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,362
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

573
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,781
What do I do?

574
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,491
Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

575
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,534
Let me see.

576
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,077
Please help.

577
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,912
-Huh?
-Uh, wait, hold on.

578
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,913
Put her on the bed.

579
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,665
-Please take a look at her.
-Here, lookout.

580
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,839
Her temperature is way too low.

581
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,008
Here, hold it down
so she doesn't kick it off.

582
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,552
Hold her. Hold her.

583
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,262
-Hyeon-ju, Hyeon-ju. It's okay.
-Call an ambulance right now.

584
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,888
I'll give her a sedative
and clean her wounds.

585
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,806
Okay.

586
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,767
Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

587
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,687
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

588
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,863
EMERGENCY CALL

589
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,758
-Too hot.
-Hang in there, Hyeon-ju.

590
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,092
Your temperature is a little too low.

591
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,761
Too hot. I'm too hot.

592
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,012
You're going to the hospital soon.

593
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,805
We're all here for you,
so don't worry, okay?

594
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,600
The science teacher gave me a weird shot.

595
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,435
A shot?

596
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,896
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a weird shot?

597
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,523
He tried to kill me.

598
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,569
Hey, Hyeon-ju, tell me what shot?

599
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,654
I'm gonna kill them all.

600
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,281
Hyeon-ju.

601
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
Hey, are you okay?

602
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,580
-Hold her down so I can give her the shot.
-Okay.

603
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,833
Just a minute, okay?

604
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,169
Hyeon-ju. Just hang on.

605
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,218
It's so strange.
Hyeon-ju was really odd.

606
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,219
-Yeah, totally.
-It's weird.

607
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,472
Everyone else saw that, right?
First, she just disappeared all day,

608
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,308
then she comes in all bloody
talking about the science teacher.

609
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,477
She could have gone somewhere
and got hurt,

610
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,937
then came back here
and collapsed all of a sudden.

611
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
-It's got to be true.
-Did you hear something?

612
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,194
You know how we heard
his son went missing?

613
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,572
I heard he didn't go missing.

614
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,075
-Suicide.
-Come on, don't fall for that.

615
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,992
-That's silly.
-He committed suicide?

616
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,829
-You believe that?
-No, really. It's true, okay?

617
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,624
Hyeon-ju hung out with the same crowd
that bullied Jin-su all the time.

618
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,794
So the science teacher
went after them one-by-one.

619
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,920
He hunted them down.

620
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,798
-And kill them.
-Who said that?

621
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,050
-All his students.
-Which one?

622
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,137
Last time I saw Hyeon-ju
was in the science lab.

623
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,263
Hey.

624
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,723
I think maybe…

625
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,143
Mr. Lee made porn with Hyeon-ju.

626
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,019
-Porn?
-Hey, you moron.

627
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,813
Get your mind out of the gutter, asshole.

628
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,897
You fat ass.

629
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,566
Why are you cursing at me, dick?

630
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,067
Because you're a fucking pervert,
dumb ass.

631
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,569
So why did he kidnap her then?

632
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,821
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course not. Stupid.

633
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,364
Easy, I'm your brother-in-law.

634
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,116
I told you to stop saying that.

635
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,703
Hey, tell us what happened?

636
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,205
I-sak, wait, what happened?

637
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,458
-Hey, what happened?
-How is she?

638
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,625
How's Hyeon-ju?

639
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,295
It's no joke.
She was biting people and trashing around…

640
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,212
Where's On-jo?

641
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,172
She got hurt.

642
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,340
Where? How bad?

643
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,550
She'll be fine.

644
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,135
Uh, Hyeon-ju bit her?

645
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,511
I think she went crazy.

646
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,014
Her temperature is super low,
but she said she was hot.

647
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,599
She tried to bite us.

648
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,267
-What the hell?
-So does she have rabies?

649
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,643
What an idiot.

650
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,937
And Hyeon-ju had this weird smell.

651
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,064
-What smell?
-The same one as the science teacher.

652
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,566
-A rotting corpse.
-Yeah, that.

653
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,901
-I knew it.
-And she said,

654
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,777
Mr. Lee gave her some kind of weird shot.

655
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,446
What a total psycho.

656
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,865
Shouldn't we tell the police about this?

657
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,534
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she's gonna handle it.

658
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,245
Look…

659
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,539
She's just been sitting there studying.

660
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,458
Yeah, well, she is the top student.

661
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,586
-So? Where's On-jo?
-In the infirmary.

662
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,771
It seems like she went
into shock due to hypothermia.

663
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,022
I manage to give her a sedative.

664
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,234
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

665
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,529
Yeah. I did. They're on their way.
Please take good care of her.

666
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,863
-Will do.
-Thank you.

667
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,241
AMBULANCE

668
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,242
Thank you.

669
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,826
-Are you okay?
-That was scary.

670
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,662
Look at me. Were you scared?

671
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
Definitely.

672
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,831
Man.

673
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,126
So, what's wrong with her?

674
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,837
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

675
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm on calls, so I won't be home.

676
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,593
Just try not to get it wet.

677
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,470
Call me right away
if you need anything at all.

678
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,222
I'll rush right over. Okay?

679
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,349
-Okay.
-Good. Bye, hon.

680
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,894
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

681
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,439
Thank you and take good care
of her for me please.

682
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,524
Given the situation,

683
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,150
-I can't stick around.
-Okay.

684
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,277
-Hurry up, Dad.
-You should go.

685
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,832
Thank you for your help, guys.

686
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
I'm going to head back in a few minutes…

687
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,256
Please make sure you don't tell anyone
about this just yet, okay?

688
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,382
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

689
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,300
All right.

690
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,177
I think it's better not to tell anyone
for the time being.

691
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,220
Sounds good.

692
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,932
Go back to class. Let's go.

693
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,352
Are you okay? Does she bite you?

694
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,523
-No, it's just a scratch.
-You sure you're all good?

695
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,863
Hey. You wanted to meet on the roof?

696
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,490
-What?
-You said come up after lunch.

697
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
Can you just tell me now?

698
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,413
I'm actually
playing basketball after lunch.

699
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,591
What's that?

700
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,805
NAM ON-JO

701
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,515
Wait. This means…

702
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,768
you wanna go out with me.

703
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,687
Yeah.

704
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,230
But aren't you with Cheong-san?

705
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,565
No.

706
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,401
We've lived next door
ever since we were little kids,

707
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,153
and his mom always gives me free chicken…

708
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,655
…and I do like chicken.

709
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,947
I love it actually.

710
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,157
But not him, I swear.

711
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,076
Ah, okay.

712
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,786
-On-jo!
-So I--

713
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,413
Where did you get hurt?

714
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,375
How bad is it, huh?

715
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,751
You're such a klutz sometimes.

716
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,044
I'm fine.

717
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,716
How bad was she hurt?
She's pretty clumsy, huh?

718
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,801
No.

719
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,969
Hyeon-ju tried to bite us.

720
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,805
She got hurt
trying to stay out of the way.

721
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,847
Hey.

722
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,974
You're going out with On-jo?

723
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,603
Right?

724
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,064
Mm-hm. Right.

725
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,068
Can't believe you bought that? You freak.

726
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,987
Seriously, even if it was
the end of the world,

727
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,656
and it was her, me, and a zombie,

728
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,533
I'd honestly rather date the zombie.

729
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,493
Why do you ask?

730
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,828
No reason.

731
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,871
Let's go.

732
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,623
Anyway, what's for lunch today?

733
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,125
Do you have any idea?

734
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,793
I want some <i>tonkatsu</i>.

735
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,341
How far are we from the hospital?

736
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,926
We're almost there.

737
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,574
She went to the hospital.

738
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,618
-Wait.
-Mr. Lee. Wait.

739
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,620
You don't understand.
She can't be in a hospital.

740
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,621
-Let all calm down.
-What are you talking about?

741
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,123
No! Let go of me!

742
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,333
No! It's time for you
to explain yourself here.

743
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,835
We can't send Hyeon-ju to a hospital.

744
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,545
We have to put her in quarantine.

745
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,755
Hey.

746
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,006
Sit down, Mr. Lee.

747
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,382
You've already turned things upside down

748
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,426
when you're at school
with the story about your son.

749
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,679
How the hell could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

750
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,473
And of course, you forced us to bury it.

751
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,517
Oh, that's some crack of bullshit, huh?

752
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,020
You know how the school's evaluation
is just around the corner.

753
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,315
You should've called me
before calling an ambulance, Sun-hwa.

754
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,025
What do you think
is gonna happen if the police come?

755
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,651
Well, I already called the police.

756
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,779
A teacher should deal
with school matters internally.

757
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,489
I'll call the police
if we need them.

758
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,490
-Tell them not to come.
-I mean…

759
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,699
Mr. Lee.

760
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,367
Police.

761
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,794
It's been a while,

762
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,754
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan.

763
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,616
Huh?

764
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,262
It's so good.

765
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,638
-What?
-Nothing.

766
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,643
Hey, Cheong-san can feel that.

767
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,313
I wasn't looking at him.

768
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,898
Yeah, right.

769
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,649
The whole school knows
you two are going out on dates.

770
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,692
We're not dating.

771
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,987
I'm serious.

772
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,947
Mm-hm, sure. Yeah.

773
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,658
Actually…

774
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,286
You can't tell anyone, okay?

775
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,954
About what?

776
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,081
Well…

777
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,416
It was you, right?

778
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,543
Forget it.

779
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,046
-Hey, come on.
-Stop it.

780
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,172
Tell me.

781
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,381
Stop. No.

782
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
You slept with Cheong-san, didn't you?

783
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,888
You did. I got it, am I right?

784
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,264
-Are you insane?
-Ow!

785
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,183
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

786
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,060
What?

787
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,812
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

788
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,315
You mean?

789
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,359
-What?
-My gosh.

790
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,736
-Quiet.
-Oh, my god. I can't believe it.

791
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,656
-Quiet.
-Are you completely insane?

792
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,950
Him? Su-hyeok?

793
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,867
Quiet.

794
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,205
-You eat it. It's okay.
-What?

795
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,749
How'd you do it? What did you say?
Did you ask him on a date or what?

796
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,250
My name tag.

797
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,587
So you threw yourself at him.

798
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,881
So?

799
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,469
Well, that's all.

800
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:33,887
Huh?

801
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,098
He didn't say anything?

802
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,183
-Mm-hm.
-Not even a vibe?

803
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,393
Mm-hm.

804
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,854
You couldn't tell how he felt or anything?

805
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,898
I'm going crazy.

806
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,567
You're making me go crazy.

807
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,454
Wearing those for too long
is bad for your ears.

808
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,668
Earbuds. They're bad for your ears.

809
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,253
I know.

810
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,850
Do you wanna go visit Hyeon-ju later?

811
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,476
Why?

812
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,270
You're our class president.

813
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,939
You know my mom made me class president

814
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,150
by donating a bunch
of money to the school.

815
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,779
That's why no one else thinks of me
as the real class president.

816
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,657
So why the hell should I act like it?

817
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,619
What?

818
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,662
I'm surprised.

819
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,499
I've actually never heard you talk
that much before.

820
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,795
I thought you never said
more than five words at a time.

821
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,810
I want to cut class.

822
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,645
I'm sleepy.

823
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,773
What the hell?

824
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,066
INFIRMARY

825
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,025
Hey, hey.

826
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,068
Come here, come here.

827
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,194
-What?
-Check this out.

828
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,531
Oh, boy. What's wrong with her?

829
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,077
Probably drunk
out of her mind.

830
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,455
Is she serious?
She's gonna get fired.

831
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,084
What's she doing
in bare feet?

832
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,964
What the hell?

833
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,717
God. Damn.

834
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,887
-She really hit her head.
-That was freaky.

835
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,013
What's wrong with her?

836
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,599
<i>Is she sick?</i>

837
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,103
<i>I think she likes you.</i>

838
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,854
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

839
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,731
What is she doing?

840
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,566
Help!

841
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,530
Shit. What the fuck?

842
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,709
Holy shit, run!

843
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:52,919
Shit.

844
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,073
Eun-ji.

845
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,578
Don't do it.

846
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,831
Wanna come up?

847
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,333
Eun-ji.

848
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,835
Uh, come down.
Let's just talk down here, please.

849
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,170
Come on.

850
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,129
They said…

851
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,007
they'll gonna post it online.

852
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,217
Huh? No.

853
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,427
They said they delete it.

854
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,346
They, they promised me they would.

855
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,931
This is a living hell.

856
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,934
So I'm just trying to escape from hell.

857
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,352
I'll take care of it.

858
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,770
I can do it.

859
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,231
I'll delete them all.

860
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,441
Just…

861
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,652
Please don't…

862
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,530
I'm begging you.
Please don't do it, Eun-ji.

863
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,953
Why are you crying?

864
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,124
Do you…

865
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,710
like me?

866
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,435
Two losers who liked each other,
that's hilarious.

867
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,858
But when two losers go out,
they get even lamer.

868
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,280
So stay away from me.

869
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,741
Eun-ji.

870
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,451
And stay away from…

871
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,578
my dead body.

872
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,964
Eun-ji. Eun-ji, Eun-ji!

873
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,504
Hey, Prez!

874
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,922
Hurry!

875
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:24,839
Hurry!

876
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,549
Run!

877
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,184
I have a great idea.

878
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,019
Just ask Cheong-san.

879
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,896
Forget it.

880
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,816
Seriously, he and Su-hyeok
are really close.

881
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,318
Why don't you
just ask Cheong-san how he feels?

882
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,611
No.

883
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,823
On-jo. You have to listen to me.

884
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,118
There's a good chance Su-hyeok
already told him everything.

885
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,787
It doesn't matter. He'll make fun of me.

886
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,623
Put mine away too, gopher.

887
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,999
Hey, Cheong-san.

888
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,127
On-jo needs to talk to you.

889
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,757
Hey. So, you're close to Su-hyeok, right?

890
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,592
For sure. Why?

891
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,511
Told you?

892
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,013
What is it?

893
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,391
Nothing. So get lost.

894
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,394
-So, On-jo--
-Hey.

895
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,354
You're dead.

896
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,397
Understood.

897
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,234
Hey. A real friend
would help out right now.

898
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:29,946
What is it?

899
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,870
Wait a second? Did Su-hyeok say something?

900
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,787
No.

901
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:39,956
Did you fight?

902
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,624
I just said no.

903
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,420
Then what's going on,
did he say that he likes you?

904
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,047
Did he say that?

905
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,757
-What?
-That he likes me?

906
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,342
Who? Su-hyeok?

907
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,722
No? He didn't say anything?

908
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,057
Hmm, what are you talking about?

909
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,934
Earlier…

910
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,647
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-About what?

911
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,065
You really can't tell anyone.

912
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,484
About what, On-jo?

913
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,822
I asked him out earlier, but I don't know.

914
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,324
He hasn't said anything.

915
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,580
Hey.

916
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,915
Yeah, what?

917
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,126
Any chance you could ask him
what he thinks about me?

918
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,962
We're not close.

919
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,757
Yeah, you are.

920
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,800
No, we're not, really.

921
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,721
Can't you help me out for once?

922
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,598
You're not my friend.

923
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,513
Shit. Shit.

924
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,398
Move! Move!

925
