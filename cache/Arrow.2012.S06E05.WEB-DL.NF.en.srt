[Oliver] <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,545
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,506
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,634
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment
and honor the promise</i>

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,386
<i>I made to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>So I asked the best man I know to help.</i>

7
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>His name is John Diggle
and he is the Green Arrow.</i>

[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,148
Pollard. She's using last night's
disaster as a pretext

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,609
to introduce her anti-vigilante
legislation to the council.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm invoking chapter nine
of the city charter.

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,698
That would convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

13
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,450
to a citywide referendum.

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,534
What do you want?

15
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,619
To operate without interference.

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,455
So you can keep killing people.

17
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,707
You don't seem to know that this is a war.

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,085
The intel that you gave me on my son,
Joe, panned out...

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>So I'm heading to Calgary.</i>

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,921
Good luck, Slade.

00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,136
[indistinct chatter]

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,981
Miss Pollard, Captain wanted you to
see the latest COMPSTAT.

23
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,441
Thanks, Lieutenant.

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783

[policeman] Officer down. Code three.

Officer down.

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,522
Well, I'm just glad no one
was seriously hurt.

30
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,856
How do you want to handle this?

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,775
I'd like you to
issue a statement on my behalf.

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,026
On your behalf?

33
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,113
{\an8}I have an old friend in town
that needs my help

34
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
{\an8}and I might not be back in the office
for a few hours.

35
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,909
{\an8}<i>Do we have any idea
who the shooter was targeting?</i>

36
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,993
{\an8}We're working on it.

37
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,955
{\an8}Good. Be the Mayor until I get back.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,581
{\an8}For real?

39
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,458
{\an8}No. It's a figure of speech.

40
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,461
{\an8}Just don't make any laws while
I'm out of the office, okay?

41
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,838
{\an8}Fine.

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,050
{\an8}And don't worry about the shooter.
We're gonna nail his ass.

43
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,468
{\an8}I know you will.

44
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,098
{\an8}Sorry. That was work.

45
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,517
{\an8}Don't apologize.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,645
{\an8}I appreciate the meeting.

47
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,564
{\an8}You helped me find my son.

48
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,899
{\an8}The least I can do is help you find Joe.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,235
{\an8}He doesn't go by that name anymore.

50
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,987
{\an8}He changed his name?

51
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,822
{\an8}It was his mother's idea.

52
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,952
{\an8}Her maiden name. He goes by "Kane" now.

53
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,246
{\an8}What happened to him?

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,666
{\an8}I tracked him to Calgary,
but by then he had gone.

55
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,128
{\an8}So, I followed him to Ibiza,

56
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,047
{\an8}and then Mombasa.

57
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,632
{\an8}Mombasa?

58
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,678
{\an8}The kid took after his father.

59
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,639
{\an8}While we were stuck on Lian Yu,

60
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,559
{\an8}he went down and joined
the Australian Intelligence Service.

61
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,770
{\an8}And a week ago, in Kasnia,

62
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,397
{\an8}a mission went south.

63
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,610
{\an8}He was dealing in arms,
some locals caught him.

64
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,155
{\an8}Supposedly, he didn't
have a fair trial and now he's...

65
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,283
{\an8}Serving a life sentence.

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,660
{\an8}Like a rat in a cage.

67
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,999
{\an8}Okay, Slade, what do you need?

68
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,797
{\an8}I need you to help me find my son.

69
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,676
{\an8}Last we met, you told me
that I couldn't live in two worlds.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,929
{\an8}I'm not asking you to come back in.

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,517
{\an8}Strangely enough,
what I need is diplomacy,

72
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,979
{\an8}which means I don't want Green Arrow,

73
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,940
{\an8}I need Oliver Queen.

74
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,316
{\an8}For what?

75
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,194
{\an8}Can I ask you just to trust me
on this one, kid?

76
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,489
{\an8}I've organized transport to Kasnia.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,116
{\an8}Wheels up at 2200.

78
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
{\an8}I'll understand
if you don't want to join me.

79
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,212
{\an8}But if you do,
I'll meet you out front at 2100.

80
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,798
{\an8}Okay, kid?

81
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,977
Okay, bring that stuff over here.

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
Sorry.

83
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,441
Hey, don't worry.

84
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,444
It's only tent poles.

85
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,407
It's not like we're gonna
stick around long enough to use them.

86
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,953
Why'd you say that?

87
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,541
You're always leaving. I can't
believe we even made it this far.

88
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,626
Listen, you know
that I work for Australian Airlines

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,752
and I have to travel.

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,462
But I promise you,

91
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,881
this weekend, it's just about you and me.

92
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,510
Father and son. Out in the wild.

93
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,598
Come on. Go find some flat land,
and pitch a tent.

94
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,985
Got him.

95
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,653
I didn't get him, get him,
but I've identified him.

96
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,196
-Identified who?
-Our sniper.

97
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,282
I thought your T-Spheres
could track his visor.

98
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,742
Well, that was then.

99
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,995
This is apparently now.
He must have hacked the tracer.

100
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,288
Or got a new visor.

101
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,290
It's not like they sell 'em
at Walmart, Felicity.

102
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,834
Guys, update time. I think
our vigilante's back in town.

103
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,169
He's the shooter?

104
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,670
I saw him coming out of the sniper's nest.

105
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,505
CSU's here.

106
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,424
I don't know how much evidence
we'll be able to pull.

107
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,967
[Curtis] <i>Why don't we work
with what we have?</i>

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,220
Mainly, the Vigilante seemed to be
targeting Councilwoman Pollard.

109
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,680
"Seemed to be" being the operative word.

110
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,058
Well, Pollard's the one who's
championing the anti-vigilante bills.

111
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,435
Seems like a guy named "Vigilante"
wouldn't like her much.

112
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,644
[John]<i>Yeah. But martyr her?</i>

113
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,522
That'd get this bill passed faster
than you could say "obstruction."

114
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,817
If it passes, I'm gonna
have to consider arresting myself.

115
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,655
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

116
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,657
You're not SCPD.

117
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,243
No, he's not.
And this is not a federal case.

118
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,162
Still doesn't explain what John Diggle,

119
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,373
who works personal security for
the mayor, is doing at a crime scene.

120
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,167
I have relevant experience, and...

121
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,795
the mayor thought this could use
a fresh set of eyes.

122
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,254
What type of experience?

123
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,673
Sniper.

124
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,343
I don't recall
reading that in your military file.

125
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,387
I'm sorry, tell me again, why you're
reviewing my service jacket?

126
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,848
Mayor Queen didn't
mention he was under investigation?

127
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,517
Of course he did,
it has nothing to do with this.

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,103
But you've been working with him
for the past six years.

129
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,938
Which makes us overdue for a chat.

130
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,691
I can wait for a subpoena if you prefer.

131
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,318
No. I'm an open book.

132
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,570
Step into my office.

133
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,740
Uh-uh.

134
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,200
Private conversation.

135
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,290
Hey, William.

136
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,375
Hi.

137
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,170
How are those quadratic equations going?

138
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,672
I hate them.

139
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,340
Yeah, those were the days.

140
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,134
Where's your dad?

141
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,260
In his room.

142
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,014
Huh.

143
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,391
Do you remember
when our biggest problem in life

144
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,934
was solving a quadratic equation?

145
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,269
Mmm-mmm.

146
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,230
I mean, I never really worried
about them, but no.

147
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,067
Well, now, we have metas crashing
bachelorette parties, so...

148
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,613
Wow. Slade invited you on
a romantic getaway?

149
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,948
Something like that.

150
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,117
Where? Don't say Aruba. That's our spot.

151
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,952
[sighs] Kasnia.

152
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,078
Wow!

153
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,497
His son is in some trouble.

154
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,541
The kind of trouble you need
to get in more trouble to fix it?

155
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,587
Well, Slade says that
he has a diplomatic solution

156
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,381
that requires my name
and not me in a mask.

157
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,551
I'm worried that if I don't go,
he will take a more aggressive approach.

158
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,096
So the empty bag, is that second thoughts?

159
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,974
Or can't decide what T-shirt to pack?

160
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,019
Because I'm out.

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,023
I made a promise to my son and I'm out.

162
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,983
It sounds like
you made a promise to Slade, too.

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,526
You think I should go?

164
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,361
It's not like you're
going back to your old life.

165
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
I wanted you to tell me not to go.

166
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,993
Look, Slade is not
my favorite person, but...

167
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,746
I mean, it's not about Slade.

168
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,749
It's about his son.

169
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,169
If you don't go, you're just gonna
beat yourself up about it.

170
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,838
If, when, it veers from diplomacy,
and I have to break

171
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,342
my promise to William, I will beat
myself up over that too.

172
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,636
-Then tell William what you're doing.
-What?

173
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,806
Spare him the details of,
you know, Slade being Slade

174
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,392
and tell him that you are
helping a friend.

175
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,186
He'll understand that.

176
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,856
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

177
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,983
He's his father's son.

178
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,694
[breathes deeply]

179
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,534
[sirens wailing distantly]

180
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,966
How long is this flight?

181
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,263
It's about 12 hours.

182
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,516
Thanks for coming, kid.

183
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,102
Let's go get your boy.

184
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,482
[lock beeps]

185
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,291
SCPD!

186
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
Hey!

187
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,884
[sonic scream]

188
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,974
Stay down.

189
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,653
[gasps]

190
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
It's you.

191
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,491
[gate rattles]

192
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,922
Got your 9-1-1. Is everything okay?

193
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,468
Look at her face.
That is not an "okay" face.

194
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,013
Dinah?

195
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,601
Vigilante made another move on
Councilwoman Pollard tonight.

196
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,479
I almost got him.

197
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,357
It's cool, D. We'll nail that bastard.

198
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,360
I hit him with my cry.

199
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,405
I shattered his visor
and he took off his mask.

200
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,576
I saw his face.

201
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,661
Can you ID him?

202
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,372
His name is Vincent Sobel.

203
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,751
He's my old partner.

204
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,670
I'm sorry. When you say partner,

205
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,506
do you mean partner,
or do you mean, "partner"?

206
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,590
Both.

207
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,925
Now I'm confused.

208
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,052
Dinah, I thought you said
your partner died in the line.

209
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,972
He was shot in the head
right in front of me.

210
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,353
No!

211
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,319
Okay, well, I know you believe
you saw what you saw tonight,

212
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,406
but it was night, probably dark.

213
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,157
It was him, Felicity.

214
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,202
It was Vincent. I know it.

215
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,746
I know it sounds crazy.

216
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,289
Dinah, this doesn't change anything.

217
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,501
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

218
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,420
I know.

219
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,381
I know. Where are you
with the shell casing John found?

220
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,216
The casing appears to be magnetized.

221
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,300
Bullets aren't magnetic.

222
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,844
They can be if they are stored
in an environment

223
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,470
with a strong magnetic field.

224
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,519
You think it's something you can trace?

225
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,937
I like your optimism.

226
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,022
It's not optimism, Felicity.

227
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,190
It's faith.

228
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,945
Dinah said that you had a chat
with our FBI BFF?

229
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,241
Oh, yes. She's tough,
but I pushed back pretty hard.

230
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,451
Can we put that to bed?

231
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,994
-[phone ringing]
-Good.

232
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,496
Hello?

233
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,708
Special Agent Watson...

234
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,752
Yes, sure. I can come by tomorrow,
no problem.

235
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,421
All right, see you then.

236
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,007
Definitely not put to bed.

237
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
So where's your point of contact?

238
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,804
I don't know.

239
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,556
His name's Nylander.

240
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,350
A foreign associate of mine
from back in the service days.

241
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,769
He was a bit of a jackarse
and never on time.

242
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,646
[Nylander] He's not that bad.

243
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,901
[chuckles] Slade Wilson.

244
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,235
The Terminator.

245
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,237
I haven't heard that name in a while.

246
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,073
So, you're running later than usual.

247
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,658
Yeah, I was with a girl.

248
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,494
Forget about it. Look at you.

249
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,829
Mirakuru did you wonders.

250
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,708
Now what? You're not sensitive
about that shit, are you?

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,127
You were quite the madman, I hear.

252
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,838
You promised me something.
Did you bring it?

253
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,133
Or did I waste my time
traveling 7,000 miles

254
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,343
for you to screw with me?

255
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,303
Truth be told,

256
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,181
I'm glad you got your marbles back.

257
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,352
So who's this?

258
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,271
He's a friend of mine.
Don't worry about him.

259
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,398
With you, I always worry.

260
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,151
This should work.

261
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,153
Thank you.

262
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,404
That's it? Just thank you?

263
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,657
No extravagant dinner? No pints?

264
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,617
Maybe next time,

265
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,869
when my son's not
rotting in a third-world prison.

266
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,789
He's lucky to have you as a father.

267
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,667
My son wouldn't be in this mess,

268
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,252
if anybody else was his father.

269
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,505
Just be careful, comrade.

270
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,550
Your boy was snooping around
some private-op mercenaries.

271
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,218
Some not-so-nice guys.

272
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
Under certain circumstances,

273
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,017
I'm not so nice a guy.

274
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,486
Yeah, not so big in the decoration,
are you?

275
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,864
I'm less enthusiastic for people
wasting my time.

276
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,948
Okay.

277
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,616
You're seeing Oliver Queen again.

278
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,953
Yeah. These new prescription glasses
are really working wonders. [chuckles]

279
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,916
Just a little FBI interrogation
humor, you know.

280
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,043
You are Mr. Queen's alibi

281
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,879
for certain evenings where
the Green Arrow was active.

282
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,255
If you say so.

283
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,549
My point is, are you prepared to
testify under oath,

284
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,677
under the pains and penalties of perjury,
in support of those alibis?

285
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,220
Yeah. Absolutely.

286
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,055
100%.

287
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,599
Super ready.

288
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,933
[phone chimes]

289
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,355
Everything all right?

290
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,107
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,569
Yeah. I'm just late for a coffee date.

292
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,822
-So, I'd like to...
-Go.

293
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,365
Go.

294
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,202
Thank you. This was pleasant.

295
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,500
I call this play Liberty Watch.

296
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,254
A famous American mayor comes
to small war-torn Kasnia,

297
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,716
to fight for the release of a man
who has been wrongfully accused.

298
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,468
This is very clever.

299
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,845
Like I said, it's a "diplomatic solution."

300
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,015
Well, Slade, still. I don't think
that they're gonna free your son,

301
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,309
just because I give him a photo op.

302
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,311
No. The photo op is just to gain entry.

303
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
Of course, they'll need a reason
to release him.

304
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,275
And here are 50,000.

305
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,445
Assuming this works,

306
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
where do we meet?

307
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,907
When you pick up Joe,

308
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,784
go straight to the airport.

309
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,661
Here is an alias passport for him

310
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,788
and tickets for you both

311
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,872
to London.

312
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,837
You're not even gonna see him?

313
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,675
I need you to promise me

314
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,176
that you won't tell him I helped.

315
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,178
No. I'm not gonna lie to your son.

316
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,263
It's better this way.

317
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,349
For him or for you?

318
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,851
Wait, are you...

319
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,064
Are you afraid that he's gonna
see you as Deathstroke,

320
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,192
and not the man you were? The...

321
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,195
The man I think you are now.

322
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,073
I gave up my right to be his father

323
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,575
when I stepped out of the light

324
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,160
into shadows,

325
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,997
and became this monster.

326
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,250
Your son will forgive you

327
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,585
the way that my son forgave me.

328
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,380
Joe knew
that I was coming to look for him,

329
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,424
so he contacted his mother

330
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,135
and she sent me a message

331
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,594
to stay away.

332
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,932
You got your second chance, kid.

333
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,144
And I'm happy for you.

334
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,650
Some fathers aren't that lucky.

335
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,453
So, tell me this is not the freshest
fish that somebody's caught for you.

336
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,204
I don't even like fish.

337
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,623
Not all fish are the same.

338
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,292
Trust me, kid.

339
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,798
Are you really a pilot?

340
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,426
Of course, I am.

341
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,011
Stop lying.

342
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,013
Why are you being like this?

343
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,514
We never get free trips.

344
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,268
My friend Nick's dad flies for Ferris Air.

345
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,479
They get free trips all the time.

346
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,610
-[woman] Here, honey, keep up.
-[boy] Okay.

347
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,660
Unfortunately, I work
for a cheaper airline

348
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,663
that doesn't allow for free vacations.

349
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,084
Whatever. I'm not hungry.

350
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,549
Don't walk too far.

351
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,188
[Dinah Drake] This place
used to house MRI machines.

352
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,649
[Green Arrow] We are in the right place.
That's all that matters.

353
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,776
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

354
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,152
How was it with Watson?

355
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,445
Terrifying.

356
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,072
We knew she was planning
a case against Oliver,

357
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,117
but I'm starting to think her net
is widening to include us.

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,493
She hasn't contacted me yet.

359
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,120
Wait, why hasn't she?

360
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,538
[Wild Dog] How about
we not worry about this

361
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,957
while we're in the lair
of a psycho-killer?

362
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,542
-Sorry.
-[Green Arrow] Here.

363
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,341
There's enough ordinance here
for a small war.

364
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
You don't need this many bullets
for one councilwoman.

365
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,723
When you called Vince
a psycho-killer, you weren't wrong.

366
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,733
Mr. Queen...

367
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,277
Thank you for taking the time.

368
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,362
It is not every day I meet celebrity.

369
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,655
I'm not famous.

370
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,700
I saw you on news once.
You punched man with camera.

371
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,202
Yup, I sure did.

372
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,540
They also say you are quite good
with bow and arrow.

373
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,876
Oh, don't believe everything
that you see on TV.

374
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
Okay, okay.

375
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,381
I understand you are
with organization in hopes to...

376
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,842
To request the release
of one of your prisoners.

377
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,927
Kane Wolfman.

378
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,804
[sighs]

379
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
I wish you come earlier.

380
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,271
[door opens]

381
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,656
What're you doing back here?

382
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,995
Where is my son?

383
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,831
[sighs]

384
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,294
There was a... A fight in the prison yard

385
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,714
that Joe tried to break up.

386
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,969
Someone pushed, and he hit his head...

387
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,514
He's gone.

388
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,025
[Slade] He never knew.

389
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,737
Never knew what?

390
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,200
[shuddering]

391
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,202
That I loved him.

392
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,995
I'm sure he did, Slade.

393
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
I don't remember the last time

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,085
I told him...

395
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,920
Well, you were his father.

396
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,964
Trust me, he knew.

397
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,930
I should have come with you to the prison.

398
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,642
I know it wouldn't have
made any difference, but...

399
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,853
at least I could have seen him...

400
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,232
Say goodbye.

401
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,152
Well, you still can.

402
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,824
You can still say goodbye.

403
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,626
Joe! Good catch.

404
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,628
Come on.

405
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,713
We are not here to mope around.

406
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,800
[chuckles]

407
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,179
Excuse me,

408
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,141
could you take a photo of my son and I?

409
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,392
Sure.

410
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,275
[camera clicks]

411
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,111
I'm Slade.

412
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,195
Darryl. Nice to meet you.

413
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,280
This is my son, Joe.

414
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,698
-Hey, Joe.
-Nice to meet you.

415
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,172
[John] Don't burn yourself out, Dinah.

416
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,759
We need you for the long haul, remember?

417
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,637
There's no long haul.
We're putting this bastard down.

418
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,973
Remember, this bastard was
your partner and your boyfriend.

419
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,850
I don't need you
to remind me of that, thanks.

420
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,437
[chuckles] No, you don't need me
to remind you of that.

421
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,189
But you do need someone
to point out the fact

422
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,483
that perhaps a part of you
should be happy to have him back.

423
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,945
John, when Vince died, I did
my absolute best to kill myself.

424
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,199
I became somebody I didn't even recognize.

425
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,368
To avenge somebody
who I don't even recognize anymore.

426
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,745
Somebody who kills innocent people.

427
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,747
You and Vince went through
something horrific.

428
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,582
You did some things you regret.

429
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,793
Maybe there's a part of you
that's putting that on him.

430
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,294
John, he's a psychopath.

431
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,713
It doesn't change the fact that
he's someone who needs help, Dinah.

432
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,840
Just like you did.

433
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,387
Sorry to interrupt, but we've got
two new problems.

434
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,640
Pollard's headed over
to do a sit-down with Channel 52

435
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,558
to talk about
the anti-vigilante referendum.

436
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,561
Wait, no, that station is not secure.
SCPD cannot protect her there.

437
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,188
That's why I said we've got a problem.

438
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,398
-What's the second one?
-Agent Watson's subpoenaed me.

439
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,317
I gotta go, right?

440
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,861
Yeah. That's usually what
a subpoena means. You have to go.

441
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,196
I'm gonna head to the news station,

442
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,281
see if I can get Pollard
some extra protection.

443
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,034
-Dinah, if Vince tries anything...
-I know, John, I got it.

444
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,708
Mr. Queen,
I was not expecting a return visit.

445
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,589
Warden, this is Kane Wolfman's father.

446
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,467
He wishes to see his son's body.

447
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,970
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

448
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,429
Why?

449
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,931
You said he passed only days ago.

450
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,517
-Yes, but...
-Warden. Where's the body?

451
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,312
It is no longer in my possession.

452
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482
Where is my son's body?

453
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,152
Hey. Easy. Easy.

454
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,282
He's lying.

455
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,659
Do you want me to contact Liberty Watch?

456
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,619
Do you want me to cause
an international incident?

457
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,912
Because I'm prepared to do both.

458
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,956
The situation is complicated.

459
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,749
-Well, un-complicate it.
-Hey.

460
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,587
Trust me on this one.

461
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,506
Don't make this man angry.

462
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,217
[sighs]

463
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,679
They're called the Jackals.

464
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,432
The men your son investigated.

465
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,977
When they discovered his arrest,
which was merely him being

466
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,229
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

467
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,440
they broke into prison. Take him.

468
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,066
Why did they take him?

469
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:51,364
Torture. Your son is spy.
In his head, secrets worth millions.

470
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,244
They threatened reprisal on my family
if I spoke about it.

471
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,414
Slade. Slade.

472
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:03,126
When the Jackals took my son, they
didn't count on who his father was.

473
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,344
Okay. Every single person
in that line is ID'd twice.

474
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,012
You got it?
I don't care if it's your mother.

475
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,972
And I want two officers
at every emergency exit

476
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,224
and I need somebody to move this car.

477
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,604
Lieutenant Drake. Good to see you again.

478
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,905
All right. We're nearly ready to move
on the news station.

479
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,281
Dinah's already on site.

480
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,699
Copy.

481
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,035
Emailing Oliver?

482
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,288
Yeah, I'm just sending Oliver
some info he asked me for.

483
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,791
You know, for his adventures with Slade.

484
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,752
Are you having as much trouble with
Oliver working with Slade as I am?

485
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,836
No.

486
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,255
Having a lot more.

487
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,051
Rationally, I know that it was the
Mirakuru that made him a jerk, but...

488
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,179
But he wasn't on Mirakuru
when he left us on Lian Yu.

489
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,264
Exactly.

490
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,849
It's ironic that Oliver has more
honor than the man he's helping.

491
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
Ironic isn't the word I would use.

492
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,603
[Dinah Drake]<i>Guys, we've got a problem.</i>

493
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,063
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that...

494
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,483
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
stand down. Okay? Do not come here.

495
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,027
Dinah, we're not standing down.
We are not leaving you out there alone.

496
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,362
I'm not alone.

497
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,448
<i>Agent Watson is here.
And she brought friends.</i>

498
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,409
She's hoping the Green Arrow will show up.

499
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,869
You guys stay put, okay? I got this.

500
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,879
I asked Felicity for any intel
she could find on the Jackals.

501
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,799
She hacked the databases of every
major intelligence agency

502
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,259
in the world.

503
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,677
-And what did she find?
-Nothing.

504
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,721
These guys are ghosts.

505
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,390
That's no help.

506
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,641
This is.

507
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,643
Using closed circuit-cameras in the prison

508
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,395
and surrounding areas,
she got their escape route,

509
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,273
the license plates and then
using keyhole satellite technology...

510
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,858
She tracked them to one location.

511
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,942
Yes. She did.

512
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,028
She's brilliant. How did you get her?

513
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,072
I ask myself that every day.

514
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,994
What's in there for me?

515
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,620
Nothing.

516
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,748
I promised you.
Your only part in this was talking.

517
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,624
Circumstances have changed.

518
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,585
Not for you.

519
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,962
You've got your feet planted in one world.

520
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,756
-And you should keep them there.
-Slade!

521
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,799
These Jackals are the best of the worst.

522
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,926
All right? They're stone-cold killers.

523
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,429
And what do you think I am?

524
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,056
I think that you're outnumbered.

525
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,808
And quite frankly, I think
that you're out of practice

526
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,935
and I am not letting you do this alone.

527
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,438
[groans]

528
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,449
Alone is what I do best, kid.

529
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,328
Go ahead.

530
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,621
Tell me the truth.

531
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,842
Not bad.

532
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,219
[laughing]

533
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,814
I have to go to the bathroom.

534
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,608
I'll be back soon.

535
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,996
[Deathstroke] You are Xien Ming, an agent
for the Ministry of Defense,

536
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,623
People's Republic.

537
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,543
I'm looking for an agent
who you black-bagged.

538
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,002
Called Yao Fei.

539
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,298
You have 10 seconds
to tell me where he is.

540
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,842
Purgatory.

541
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,343
[twig cracks]

542

[grunts]

543
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,903
Hey. He's with me.

544
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,030
Excuse me. He's with me. Let him through.

545
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,702
You guys make sure that perimeter
is secure over on the side there.

546
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,579
I thought I told you to stand down.

547
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,998
Don't worry. I left the hoodie at home.

548
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,209
Well, then, what are you doing here,
John? I told you I got it.

549
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,337
But I realized, you're not exactly
in your right head.

550
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,173
My head is fine.

551
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,675
Thank you. Your little pep talk
really got through to me.

552
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,927
Dinah, you're a lousy liar.

553
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,229
He didn't always make bullets.

554
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,815
Vince.

555
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,069
He used to make this matchbox art,

556
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,032
with a tiny little paper rose
on the inside.

557
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,037
He made me one the morning
Sonos found out we were undercover.

558
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,293
There is nothing left of that man
anymore, John.

559
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,670
Dinah, earlier this year,
when he attacked Oliver's limo,

560
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,465
he had the chance to kill you,
and he didn't.

561
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,633
-Your point?
-My point is

562
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,968
that maybe there's something
left of the man you used to love.

563
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,638
If there isn't,

564
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,307
I'm going to put him down.

565
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,977
And this time, he'll stay dead.

566
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,313
-Dinah, will you just...
-You better get out of here,

567
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,440
before Watson sees you.

568
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,529
Three. Two.

569
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,240
Good evening. I'm Jane Wood.

570
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,866
Sitting tonight with Miss Emily Pollard.

571
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,744
-Welcome, Councilwoman Pollard.
-It's my pleasure.

572
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,790
[Jane] And we're going to hear thoughts
on the anti-vigilante referendum.

573
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,500
Status?

574
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,876
Pretty quiet, Lieutenant.

575
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,463
The place is locked tight.
He's not getting in here.

576
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,808
What we need is legislation
to deter others

577
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,810
from joining this vigilante movement
in the future.

578
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,104
We need to take those vigilantes
off the streets.

579
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,772
You don't think they serve a role?

580
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,190
Cops serve that role.

581
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,526
The department's been full of
corrupt cops in the past.

582
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,528
And on top of that, we're shorthanded.

583
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,613
All I know, Lieutenant,

584
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,491
is if people take the law
into their own hands,

585
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,326
we've got anarchy.

586
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,664
[Jane] John, can we have the lights
back up, please?

587
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,748

Don't move and it'll be quick.

590
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,351
Killing me won't prevent
the referendum from passing.

591
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,896
If anything, it'll make sure it does.

592
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,398
But there will be one less
corrupt politician.

for four years, Vince.

00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,012
[chuckles] Raisa knows her stuff.
Granola's good for you.

644
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,057
Were you able to help your friend?

645
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,646
No, I wasn't.

646
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,941
I really hope he finds his son.

647
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,068
Yeah.

648
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,153
I do, too.

649
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,948
<i>Is there anything else you can do for him?</i>

650
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,703
War.

651
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,789
-[grunts]
-[Deathstroke] Who's in charge?

652
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,750
[men groaning]

653
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,399
[clanging]

654
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,781
[man yells]

655
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,593
[groaning]

656
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,288
[guns cocking]

657
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,791
[Nylander] Stop it, stop.

658
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,215
Damn it, Slade.
You're going to ruin my new shoes.

659
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,550
And I just bought them, brother.

660
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,135
Nylander.

661
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,139
This man is a legend.

662
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,141
So no pulling triggers...

663
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,227
Yet.

664
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,484
Truce? Let me explain.

665
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,703
I knew you'd be involved, Nylander.

666
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,998
But you're too stupid
to run this organization.

667
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,045
So, where's the boss?

668
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,174
You know, I had really hoped
prison would be your dead end.

669
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,051
But no.

670
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,137
You just had to keep on coming,

671
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,222
didn't you?

672
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,351
We've got a great thing going here, Slade.

673
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,186
Lots of killing. Lots of money.

674
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,025
And your son, what he knows? Priceless.

675
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
You like burning bridges.

676
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,196
[chuckles]

677
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,782
So says the man who nearly
burnt down a whole city.

678
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,993
[gunshot]

679
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,539
Be smarter than that, comrade.

680
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,501
[strains]

681
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,051
Where is my son?

682
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,721
Why do you ask?

683
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,556
Hmm?

684
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,184
Do you wish to join him?

685
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,740
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah.

686
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,410
Just close this up.

687
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,840
[Samanda] Busy night.

688
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,135
Yeah.

689
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,014
Guess we're lucky you and your agents
were there to provide backup.

690
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,142
Councilwoman Pollard says she was
saved by the new Black Canary.

691
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,269
Mmm. Yeah, I heard that.

692
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,395
[Samanda] Helluva thing.

693
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,856
Pollard's saved by one
of the vigilantes she's gunning for.

694
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,109
From what I understand,
it didn't change her position.

695
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,112
What about you?

696
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,574
I try to stay out of politics.

697
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,868
No, I mean where were you tonight?

698
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,121
What do you mean? I was right there.

699
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,708
Not when the lights went out.
When it went dark, you were gone.

700
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,543
And the Black Canary was there.

701
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,630
You think I'm the Black Canary?

702
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,719
I think a lot of things.
But I focus on what I can prove.

703
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,141
Have a good night.

704
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,605
[grunting]

705
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,277
I'm curious, Slade.

706
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,945
What was your plan?

707
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,282
Kill us all and save your boy?

708
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,701
Kind of reductive, no?

709
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,036
I like to keep things simple.

710
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,165
Things rarely are, brother.

711
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,001
Well, this is.

712
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,005
I will join the Jackals

713
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,050
as long as you let my boy go.

714
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,224
[Nylander] It's like I said.

715
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,019
Things aren't so simple.

716
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,104
We need your son.

717
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,902
After all, he's our boss.

718
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,452
Hello, Father.

719
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,289
It's been a long time.
