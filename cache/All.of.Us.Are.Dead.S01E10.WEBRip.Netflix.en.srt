1
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,370
Mom.

2
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,329
Cheong-san!

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,209
Damn it.

4
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,047
What the hell?

5
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,927
Fuck!

6
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,392
There's another zombie here!

7
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Dae-su!

8
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,733
Stop it.

9
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,903
Dae-su!

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,617
Stop it!

11
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,832
What are you doing?

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,836
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,257
You son of a bitch!

14
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,434
Stop it!

15
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,066
Let go!

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,568
Get the fuck off of me!

17
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,905
Mom!

18
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,202
Mom…

19
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,563
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,565
Run!

21
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,482
Come on.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,359
Hurry up!

23
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,443
Let's go.

24
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,993
Let's go, Cheong-san.

25
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,371
Pull yourself together!

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,126
Dae-su, the others!

27
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,586
What?

28
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,129
Why aren't they coming?

29
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,255
What now?

30
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,464
Did you see them coming?

31
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,469
Please, Cheong-san.

32
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,638
-Come with us.
-Let's go.

33
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,090
Mom!

34
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,014
Mom!

35
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,343
-Mom…
-They're here. Hurry up!

36
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,929
-Wu-jin!
-Get up.

37
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,764
Come on. We have to go.

38
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,915
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

39
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,458
Shut up. You're so heavy.

40
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,836
Thank you, Mi-jin. Thank you so much.

41
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,007
-Then will you go out with me?
-No.

42
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,049
Screw you.

43
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,385
Hold on.

44
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,680
Why? What is it?

45
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,949
Hear that?

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
Shit. Fucking zombies.

47
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:31,956
Let's run.

48
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,836
Let's go.

49
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,795
To the mountain.

50
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,727
Ji-min. Help me.

51
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,156
Hyo-ryeong!

52
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,163
Get up!

53
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,805
Get up.

54
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,687
Ha-ri.

55
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,728
-Wu-jin. Go.
-What are you doing here?

56
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,855
Go.

57
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Go!

58
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,695
-Hey!
-Hyo-ryeong. You go first.

59
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,198
-Come on! Let's go!
-Let's go.

60
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,843
Nam-ra, what's wrong?

61
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,178
Damn it.

62
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,263
Run away.

63
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,850
Run away.

64
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,314
What the fuck?

65
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,398
Run!

66
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,651
-Run!
-Run! Go!

67
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,570
-Come on!
-Just go!

68
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,823
Just fucking go! You're going to die!

69
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,991
I don't fucking care!

70
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,994
-Over here!
-This way! Hurry!

71
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,329
Come on!

72
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,632
Are you crazy, Mi-jin? Let go!

73
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,258
Shut up!

74
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,597
-No! Joon-seong!
-Ha-ri!

75
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,391
What are you doing?

76
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,019
No! Let go, you assholes!

77
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,064
Fuck off, assholes!

78
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,900
Go! Hurry!

79
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,905
No! Joon-seong!

80
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,159
-Let go!
-Close the door!

81
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,538
Fuck! Let go of me!

82
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,878
Shit.

83
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,388
Damn it.

84
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,904
Hey, Cheong-san…

85
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,201
I'm so sorry.

86
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,496
I didn't know it was your mom.

87
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,302
Stop!

89
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,892
Stay away!

90
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,669
Mom…

91
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,991
A virus must have a consistent pattern
for a vaccine to be made.

92
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,327
But the Jonas Virus

93
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,497
transforms and evolves on its own.

94
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,543
It is an ever-changing monster.

95
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,799
A treatment or a vaccine are impossible.

96
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,177
There is only one solution.

97
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,056
Death.

98
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,643
Completely burning and killing the host

99
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,938
so that not a single cell remains.

100
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,152
The moment we are consumed by arrogance
and think we can defeat the virus,

101
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,030
mankind will become extinct.

102
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,787
The amount of data was massive,
so we couldn't analyze it all,

103
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,080
but a significant portion
of it is credible.

104
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,416
How can you prove that?

105
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,380
The KDCA is creating a virus
using the exact method he described.

106
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,508
If they can create the same virus,

107
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,344
they'll conclude it is credible.

108
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,596
My goodness.

109
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,683
I thought only crazy soldiers
were frightening.

110
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,977
It's scarier when a scientist goes crazy.

111
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,772
Did you hear
they're expanding martial law?

112
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,107
What do you mean?

113
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,944
Why? We're handling it well.

114
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,780
I have a friend in the NIS analysis team,

115
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,658
and he said they're discussing
pulling back the blockade to Yangdong

116
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,451
and expanding martial law.

117
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,706
What about Hyosan?

118
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,670
They understand there may be sacrifices.

119
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,722
We may have ceased our rescue operation,

120
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,060
but we never know
when we may rescue survivors again.

121
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,940
Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

122
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,111
The moment the blockade is penetrated…

123
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
someone must step forward

124
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
and abandon Hyosan.

125
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,706
Take this.

126
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,338
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

127
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,803
I thought you came in person to save me,

128
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,389
but you came to abandon me.

129
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,099
My source in the NIS tells me

130
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,936
something will happen soon in Hyosan.

131
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,900
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

132
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,278
I'll say you even resigned from your post
in order to prevent it.

133
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,114
You should be able
to avoid responsibility.

134
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,532
Responsibility for what?

135
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,075
Anything.

136
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,869
Trust me and sign it.

137
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:16,081
I'll protect your political career
until the end.

138
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,543
Do you need time to think it over?

139
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,462
They're not saving Hyosan, are they?

140
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,634
They're abandoning it?

141
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,178
Take your time and think about it.

142
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,140
Sign it within the day
and give it to the person in charge here.

143
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,116
Sir.

144
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,369
-Sir…
-Let's go.

145
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,998
Ma'am! We're getting out now, right?

146
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,585
Since the party leader came,
it'll all be resolved, right?

147
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,422
He says he'll save us, right?

148
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,049
Ma'am?

149
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,738
I thought about it all night.

150
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,824
What do I do?

151
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
How do I go on living?

152
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,882
Let's talk a little later.

153
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,636
Tomorrow or the day after.

154
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,970
Or next week.

155
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,391
After we get out of here, eat,

156
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,352
and get ourselves clean.

157
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,270
Let's talk then.

158
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,147
Okay?

159
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
We still have a lot to talk about.

160
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,742
So let's do that.

161
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,258
Whatever happens…

162
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,511
don't give up.

163
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,014
Okay?

164
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,603
Okay.

165
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,823
Never.

166
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,785
Okay.

167
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,954
You too.

168
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,207
Okay.

169
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
Me too.

170
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,607
What is it?

171
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,943
Do you see something?

172
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,325
The smell got stronger.

173
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,837
I don't smell anything.

174
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,258
I think they're all coming this way.

175
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,260
The smell is really strong.

176
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,306
We're trapped in here.

177
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,642
There's no way to leave.

178
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,645
Don't say that.

179
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,897
But it's true.

180
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,816
There is no way.

181
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,068
Whatever.

182
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
Let them kill us if they want.

183
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,497
Ha-ri.

184
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,584
You didn't get eliminated
in the preliminaries, did you?

185
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,630
No.

186
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,674
I made it.

187
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,260
You had a tournament.

188
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,013
Why did you come to the school?

189
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,978
-Are you her brother?
-Yes. So?

190
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,856
She got a perfect score.
She made it onto the national team.

191
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,773
I saw her.

192
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,027
Really?

193
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,322
Yes, really.

194
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,783
Then you're really on the national team?

195
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,618
Do Mom and Dad know?

196
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,121
How could they? Look at what's going on.

197
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,374
She jumped out of the team bus
and ran here to find you.

198
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,334
Hey, kid.

199
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,836
You better be good to her.

200
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,464
Be good to me too.

201
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,053
Who is she anyway?

202
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,930
Why does she keep speaking for you?

203
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,393
She's my friend.

204
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
We're freaking besties.

205
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,317
Jeez, you scared me.

206
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,943
What's your deal?

207
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,365
I…

208
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
What?

209
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,621
I like you.

210
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,498
What? Crazy bastard.

211
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,833
Hey.

212
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,919
What's wrong with you?

213
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,755
I saw you shooting arrows.

214
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,800
I saw you train every morning.

215
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,927
I went to every tournament
and cheered for you.

216
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,554
I'm the one who yelled,
"Bronzed beauty Jang Ha-ri."

217
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,474
I've sincerely liked you for years.

218
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,018
Now…

219
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,313
I want to be a man, not just a fan.

220
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,276
I'm going to die anyway.
So I want to say what I want first.

221
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,955
This is awesome.

222
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,332
You're Dae-su, right?

223
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,127
The one who calls my brother
"Brother-In-Law."

224
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,295
Yes.

225
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,548
So you knew.

226
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,842
Brother-In-Law, did you tell her?

227
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,260
I might have.

228
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,934
Does confessing feel cathartic?

229
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,394
Yes.

230
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,396
-Then you're okay with dying, right?
-Yes.

231
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,314
What? Now?

232
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,652
You asshole.
I'm pissed off and needed to vent.

233
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,028
-Wu-jin, stop her.
-Ha-ri.

234
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,738
-You're dead.
-Stop her.

235
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,574
-Come here.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

236
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,245
-No. I'm glad you told me.
-Hey. That's not it.

237
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,913
Yes, it is. Get over here.

238
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,416
Why don't you understand?
I really like you.

239
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,418
-Get over here, asshole.
-Wu-jin. Help.

240
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,712
-Sorry.
-Stop her, Wu-jin.

241
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,838
Get over here. You punk.

242
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,673
-Beat him up, Ha-ri.
-Come here.

243
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,633
-He needs a good beating.
-Look at him dodging.

244
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,720
Look at him.

245
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
What's that?

246
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,516
That's not it!

247
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,727
Hey.

248
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,689
Come here. You're going to keep dodging?

249
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,817
-Hey, stop it. Stop her.
-I don't want to come between you two.

250
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,320
-Come here.
-Only if you promise not to hit me.

251
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,133
Where did those fuckers go?

252
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,901
What are you doing?

253
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,445
Don't you think
we can get out using these?

254
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,793
We can tie the carts together
in a circle and go inside to escape.

255
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,305
We need string or something
to tie them together in a circle.

256
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,015
I think it's this one.

257
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,234
Cut as many as possible.

258
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,488
Hey. It won't work like this.

259
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,450
We should flip it completely
and hide underneath.

260
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536
No. We should stand it up.

261
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,830
You think the zombies can't climb this?

262
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,290
This is enough.

263
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,917
Don't be stupid.
Untie them all. Let's redo them.

264
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,837
It's too short if we close the lids.

265
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,130
What? You want to crawl?

266
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,965
Must she pull rank right now?

267
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,133
Hey.

268
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:34,759
What did you just say?

269
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,012
If you don't like it, make your own.

270
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,059
Hey.

271
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,644
Hey. What's wrong with you?

272
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,605
Stop that.

273
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,691
-Ha-ri. Stop her.
-Say that again.

274
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,277
So what if you're older.
Stay out of our way.

275
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,195
Hey.

276
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,990
Fuck you.

277
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,242
"Fuck you"? Get out of my way.

278
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,201
Cut it out.

279
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,662
You too, Joon-yeong.

280
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,748
Who the hell is she to tell us to redo it?

281
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,500
"Who the hell is she"? You rude prick.

282
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
-You're coming with us, right?
-You're the ones coming with us.

283
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,673
We're not leaving the seniors, right?

284
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,883
Of course not.

285
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,136
We're going to go together anyway.
Why are you fighting already?

286
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,014
So do as I say unless you want to die.

287
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,892
We want to make it high
so that we don't die.

288
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
Enough already.

289
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,397
How many died on our way here?

290
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,358
We can't lose anyone else.

291
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,319
We shouldn't fight among ourselves.

292
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,695
I'm not fighting to die.

293
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,323
It's because I want to live.

294
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,992
Then do as I say, asshole.

295
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,912
Then let's go separately.

296
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
Make it yourself.

297
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,041
-That fucker. Get back here.
-Joon-yeong.

298
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,250
Get back here!

299
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,671
Let go of me, fuck!
Am I doing this because I want to die?

300
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,010
Let's vote on it.

301
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,595
And who are you?

302
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,349
The classroom president.

303
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,769
One. We split up.

304
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,692
Two. We go together.

305
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,240
-We'll go together. Next.
-Is it smart to vote?

306
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,702
On life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

307
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,996
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

308
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,624
There's something called
collective intelligence.

309
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,459
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

310
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,837
-What are you looking at?
-It doesn't work like that.

311
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,338
Then what?

312
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,133
Should we vote about voting?

313
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,261
Hey, how did you kids survive until now?

314
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,221
Sorry, but will you butt out?

315
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,765
We're doing this
because you started the fight.

316
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,475
Give me an arrow so I can stab him.

317
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,060
We'll proceed to the next item.

318
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,397
One. Make the outside high.

319
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,992
Five votes.

320
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,951
Two.

321
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,455
Fold the lids and make a box.

322
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,128
Four votes.

323
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,630
What the hell?
You said it's better to stand them up.

324
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,883
I changed my mind.

325
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,304
Option one received the majority vote.
We'll make the walls high.

326
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,723
Hey. What about you?

327
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,559
It's a tie if you're for two.

328
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,812
I'm for option one.

329
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,272
Fuck.

330
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,567
-Hey. Let's make it.
-Okay.

331
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,153
Hey, don't resent me later.

332
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,197
The zombies really will climb over.

333
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,033
I'll lead the way and take responsibility.

334
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,075
You can stand back.

335
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,535
That prick.

336
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,914
Hey. Why are kids these days so damn rude?

337
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,165
No one compares to you.

338
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,585
Must you humiliate me
in front of underclassmen?

339
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,673
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method.

340
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,259
This is a sample from an infected person.

341
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,222
The two viruses are a 98% match.

342
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,601
Are you saying everything he said
in the videos is true?

343
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,521
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

344
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,942
Only the virus survives. It stimulates
the brain stem and moves the body.

345
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,652
They're like moving corpses.

346
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,614
There's no way
to bring a dead person back to life.

347
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,494
Are you saying he's dead?

348
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,207
Staff Sgt. Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

349
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960
But for that girl,

350
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,878
it's difficult to explain.

351
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,674
She was found alive.

352
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,971
There's never been a virus with this fast
of a rate of infection before.

353
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,807
Getting rid of the host is
the only solution.

354
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,060
Don't make it sound so simple!

355
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,271
You people must find a solution.

356
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,651
Commander.

357
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,319
They broke through the barricade.

358
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,405
It's spreading into Yangdong.

359
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,658
How bad is the spread?

360
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,120
They're taking Route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

361
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,873
We sent army reservists
from the area to the barricades.

362
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,921
Send all the reservists
to create a lockdown zone in Yangdong

363
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
and evacuate the city.

364
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,133
-Call in all the officials.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,803
You said you had a friend
in the NIS, right?

366
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,096
Yes, sir.

367
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,890
Ask him to meet officially.

368
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,891
Yes, sir.

369
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,857
You have to tie the knots tighter.

370
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
Here too?

371
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,531
-I hope we aren't doing anything stupid.
-My hands hurt.

372
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,490
Just do it.

373
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,535
-Hey, that looks good. Hand it to me.
-We're dead either way.

374
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
-Hey, come here.
-Me?

375
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,413
Ha-ri almost killed me.

376
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,581
-Hey.
-Hey, Dae-su.

377
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,999
A candy bar.

378
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,254
Let me see.

379
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,465
Can we eat it?

380
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,593
It's past the expiration date.

381
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,928
Can't we just eat it?

382
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
Of course we can.

383
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,691
You have to take tiny bites.

384
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,945
-Me first?
-We all need to have a bite. Okay?

385
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,410
Damn it. I said to take a small bite.

386
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,829
I only ate this much.

387
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,748
Fuck. Selfish prick.

388
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,679
I already ate.

389
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,169
I already ate too. Here.

390
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,218
-Hey.
-What?

391
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,678
Joon-yeong didn't eat.

392
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,931
How could you eat it all?

393
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
I…

394
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,273
I thought I was last. I'm really sorry.

395
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,942
Damn it.

396
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,236
Let's just put on our protective pads.

397
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,325
-That asshole.
-Joon-yeong, you wear the best one.

398
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,130
Take off your shoes. I'll do yours first.

399
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,175
Let's do this first.

400
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,681
Hold on tight.

401
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,780
Cheong-san.

402
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,239
What?

403
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,079
Don't you hate me?

404
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,372
-No.
-Why not?

405
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,415
I don't know.

406
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,876
I've never hated you.

407
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,378
That amazes me too.

408
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,566
Is everyone ready?

409
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,027
I'm opening the door.

410
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:13,945
Hold on.

411
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,657
It'll work out, right?

412
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,284
It will.

413
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,997
-Don't do anything stupid. Stick with me.
-You stick next to me.

414
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,874
Don't do anything stupid.

415
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,299
Then neither of us can move.

416
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,886
I'm scared.

417
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,357
I'll lead. You take the tail.

418
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,282
I'll open it.

419
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,701
Fuck.

420
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,328
I hope you're right.

421
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
I've seen countless zombies.

422
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,626
They don't have
the intelligence to climb over.

423
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,061
-Push!
-In front of you!

424
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,773
Go forward!

425
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,609
More!

426
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,651
Turn!

427
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,236
Turn!

428
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,530
Get in!

429
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,576
-Hurry!
-Close it!

430
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,581
Did you tie it?

431
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,625
Done! Push!

432
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,626
Push!

433
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,883
Push!

434
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,509
Fuck!

435
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,054
They're climbing over!

436
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,892
It won't fucking budge!

437
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,644
Push harder!

438
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,312
We can do this!

439
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,398
Push harder! Harder!

440
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,068
It won't move!

441
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,412
Fuck!

442
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,104
Be careful!

443
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,231
Let go!

444
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,362
What are you doing? Push!

445
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,947
Push!

446
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,852
-Su-hyeok! Above you!
-Damn it.

447
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,318
-No!
-Fuck!

448
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,874
Hey! Are you okay?

449
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,252
Damn it! Hey!

450
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,848
Shit. I shouldn't have said
I'd take responsibility.

451
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,769
-Where are you going?
-Hey, wait!

452
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,895
-Joon-yeong!
-Hey! Stop!

453
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,147
-Joon-yeong!
-What the hell?

454
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,024
-Hey!
-Joon-yeong!

455
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,116
Get off, fuckers!

456
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,452
Get off, you bastards!

457
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,537
Push!

458
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,167
Hurry! Push!

459
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,515
Let's go! Let's go home!

460
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,517
Fuck…

461
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,190
Let's go home!

462
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
A little more!

463
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,158
Just a little more!

464
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,412
-Joon-yeong…
-A little more.

465
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,501
No!

466
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,754
No! Wait! Fuck!

467
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,436
Push!

468
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,898
Push!

469
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,907
Push! Push harder!

470
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,165
-Push!
-Push!

471
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,393
Fuck!

472
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,250
HYOSAN

473
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,627
Each of those red dots

474
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,963
is the location of a random cell phone
owned by a Hyosan resident.

475
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,553
At first, they moved erratically,
so there was nothing to analyze.

476
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,683
But they slowly began to display
a collective movement.

477
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,480
If you look at them as a whole,
they're slowly traveling outward.

478
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:10,069
There is no one left
to attack in the city,

479
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,197
so they are increasing their radius.

480
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,534
It's probably similar
to animals leaving the mountains

481
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,370
and coming into civilization
when they run out of food.

482
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,956
Let's cut to the chase.

483
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,376
You predicted future movements too, right?

484
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,294
That's why you proposed to the NSC

485
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,381
that we abandon Yangdong as well
and expand martial law.

486
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,638
It isn't precise,

487
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,640
but take a look.

488
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,478
A week from now, it'll reach Seongnam,
Hanam, Gwacheon, Anyang,

489
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,605
and Gwangmyeong.

490
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,859
And the day after that, it'll reach Seoul.

491
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,070
Isn't that stretching it?

492
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,613
That's one person.

493
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,283
It was a simulation of what would happen

494
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,245
if just one infected person
got out of Hyosan.

495
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,292
That's what will happen.

496
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,340
Her heart rate is reaching 250.

497
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,553
Abnormal heartbeat detected!

498
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:34,320
I'M HUNGRY

499
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,079
Tell the tactical team
to come up with a strategy to bomb Hyosan.

500
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,082
Bomb the city?

501
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,711
Do you plan to blow up Hyosan?

502
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
We'll lose Korea trying to save Hyosan.

503
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,050
Act like a soldier.

504
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,426
We can't.

505
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,261
The infected are one thing,

506
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,472
but what about the civilians
we haven't rescued?

507
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,515
Don't calculate how many we'll kill.

508
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,393
Think only about how many we'll save.

509
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,783
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

510
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,736
Just a little bit more!

511
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,780
Untie it!

512
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,495
It's untied! Push!

513
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,372
-Push!
-Push!

514
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,084
A little more this way!

515
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,796
Fuck!

516
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,844
-It won't open!
-Shit.

517
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,053
What do you mean?

518
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,763
-The door won't open!
-Move back!

519
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,199
Ha-ri, move!

520
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,042
Get lost, assholes! Get lost!

521
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,893
Hurry up!

522
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,313
It won't open.
It must be locked from the outside.

523
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,692
Damn it.

524
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,283
Dad.

525
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,569
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

526
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,863
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
