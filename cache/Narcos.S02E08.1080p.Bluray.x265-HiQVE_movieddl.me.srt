No. Your family's safety

But I can'<i>t</i> guarantee any country

I don'<i>t</i> have that kind of power.

Not much longer, love. Keep eating.
Can I speak with you a moment?

We can't even call him.

Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

82

We're alone, Hermilda.

83
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:07,788
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

http://hiqve.com/

85
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:28,434
(In English) Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

86
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,978
Due to our efforts,
his organisation is shrinking.

87
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:36,108
Intel suggests that his inner circle
is reduced to a few <i>loyalsicarios.</i>

88
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,860
Bit of a mixed blessing.

89
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,196
<i>Fewersicarios,</i>
less radio chatter for me to trace.

90
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,866
We had a tap put on that lawyer's phone,

91
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:46,035
but I guess he isn'<i>t</i> taking
any more calls.

92
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,620
(Martinez) It's Los Pepes.

93
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:54,001
They killed Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son... his wife.

94
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:57,796
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

95
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,551
But I accepted a sad truth.

96
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:07,806
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

97
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,102
I would also like to say <i>that...</i>

98
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:17,858
I know that someone has been
in contact with Los Pepes.

99
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,986
And while it sickens me,

100
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:25,574
there's nothing I can or will do about <i>it.</i>

101
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,787
But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

102
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:33,290
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

103
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,209
And not some vigilante.

104
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,254
Thank you.

105
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,304

Listen, I need you to prepare yourself
for some blowback.

110
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:14,707
It goes high up.

111
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:20,295

when I try to get myself out of <i>it.</i>

112
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,468
If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

113
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,637
you protect yourself first.

114
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,391
You didn't know anything.

115
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:34,977
Understand?

116
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,439
What are you gonna do?

117
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,526
I don't fucking know.

118
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:45,070
We've all gone off the rails
down here, Javi.

119
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,364
You heard what Martinez said.

120
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:50,743
If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

121
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,372
We can get out of this clean.

122
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,669
So I want you to think about that
before you make any more decisions

123
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:02,671

128
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:24,443
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

129

No, I can'<i>t. It</i>'s too difficult.

'She looks beautiful.
She's at the window.'

139

She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

The one you like so much.

There, I can see Manuela, boss.

who didn'<i>t</i> read the newspapers,

160
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:13,594
'like the Gallón gang, for example,
who I doubt could even read,

161
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:17,306
'got an in-person visit from Los Pepes'
most glamorous ambassador.'

162
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,391
- Héctor.
- (In Spanish) Sir.

163
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:22,394
Do me a favour and bring
Miss Judy a beer.

164
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,188
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

165
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:26,815
This isn'<i>t</i> about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

166
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,527
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

167
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:34,406
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

168
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:40,245
Listen, Judy, you know
we never had problems with Pablo.

169
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,540
Plus, we had a very good
relationship with Kiko.

170
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,375
- Right, Berna?
- Yes.

171
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,129
And that's why we made the decision
to stay out of this shit.

172
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:53,592
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

173
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:56,053
Because things are very difficult.

174
00:11:56,178 --> 00:12:00,140
And when all this shit is over,
the organisation will change,

175
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:03,101
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

176
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:11,151
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

177
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:13,445
That's why I'm talking to you.

178
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,864
If all of us from Medellín are united,

179
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:20,244
we'll be able to say
what happens to each one of us.

180
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:27,459
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

181
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:30,379
and you tell them you're on our side.

182
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:37,844
(Héctor) She wants them
to join Los Pepes.

183
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,519
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

184
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:49,690
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

185
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:52,776
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

186
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:58,490
Here's the information.

187
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:02,119
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

188
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,579
(La Quica) This is big, boss.

189
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:09,835
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too.

190
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,131
(Pablo) When is it?

191
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:17,009
(La Quica) Friday at 9:0Opm, boss.

192
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:23,432
Take that address...
and go to Montecasino.

193
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:28,603
Take Limón with you and find out
what's going on over there.

194
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:31,815
Quica...

195
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:36,028
- Are you all right?
- Yes, boss.

196
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,453
How many men can we rely on?

197
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:50,542
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we'll need cash.

198
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,005
How much money do we have on hand?

199
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,803
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

200
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:05,682
It's... around this much.

201
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

202
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:13,523
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

203
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:19,863
Make sure we have the weapons and
the men we need when the time comes.

204
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,573
Got it?

205
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:25,744
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

206
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:31,583
Then we can take care of business.

207
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,212
- Go on.
- (Rojas) Yes, sir.

208
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:44,012
(Phone rings)

209
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,100
(lnaudible conversation)

210
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:52,896
(Steve) You wanna get that?

211
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,609
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

212
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,529
- What for?
- 'A tier-<i>onesicario at</i> police HQ.'

213
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:03,323
- 'Oh, who?'
- Nelson Hernández.

214
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,951
You know a Nelson Hernández?

215
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,746
Yeah, tier-one, my ass.

216
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,164
AKA Blackie.

217
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,707
No shit? Blackie.

218
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,460
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

219
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:17,504
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

220
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,755
We're already gone.

221
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,509
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll <i>cut</i> us a deal.

222
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:26,346
(Steve) 'Nabbing Blackie
was a huge deal for us.

223
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,473
'Bad news for Pablo.

224
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:31,601
'And there was more bad news
coming his way.

225
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,151
'The thing about drug dealers is
you can'<i>t</i> trust them for shit.

226
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:42,821
'The Lion had been running
Pablo's Miami operation for years

227
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,948
'and gotten rich too.

228
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:47,576
'But the moment Cali offered him
a better deal,

229
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:51,246
'he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.

230
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,373
'I mean, who could blame the Lion?

231
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:57,252
'Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.

232
00:15:57,377 --> 00:16:02,257
'He had introduced them to Pablo's
bankers, his smugglers, all of it.

233
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,259
'Though Pablo didn'<i>t</i> know it yet,

234
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:06,595
'his biggest rivals had pulled off
a silent coup.

235

(In Spanish) Pass that to me.

236
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:14,227
'They'd stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.

237
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:17,606
'And they didn'<i>t</i> even have
to fire a shot.'

238
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,734
(Valeria in Spanish)
Nothing relevant happened today.

239
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,863
Corrupt politicians,
celebrity divorces. Bullshit!

240
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:28,241
You don'<i>t</i> like it, go and work at CNN.

241
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,243
- (Girl) Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

242
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,245
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

243
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,414
Take a message,
I'm about to go on air.

244
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,126
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

245
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,845
What are you doing? Answer the call.

246
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,978
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

247
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,654
Hello?

248
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,705
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

249
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,502
But I need you to help me.

250
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:24,923
(Steve) 'While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,

251
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,842
'there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.

252
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:32,180
'Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.

253
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:35,141
'To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,

254
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,310
'but it could lead to more violence.

255
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:40,772
'An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.

256
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:44,025
'Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.

257
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,071
'And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.

(De Greiff in Spanish) 'I brought all the
influence the party can bear on Gaviria.'

259
00:17:53,577 --> 00:18:00,208
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

260
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:03,086
(Pablo) 'Where?'

261
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:06,006
No, that remains to be seen.

262
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:09,759
But we will meet in his office,

263
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:15,181
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

264
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,601
'Thank you, sir.'

265
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:20,478
- You're a man of your word.
- 'I am.'

266
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:23,148
Now you must be of your word.

267
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:26,818
'I will. Be sure of that.'

268
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,531
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

269
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,034
- 'Until then.'
- Thank you.

270
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:37,912
She's here.

271
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,581
Bring her here.

272
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:05,649
Hello, Valeria.

273
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:11,821
I liked it more with the hood on.

274
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:17,661
I told them, don'<i>t</i> take me anywhere
that doesn'<i>t</i> have a beautiful pool.

275
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,334
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

276
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,255
Come on.

277
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:48,274
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

278
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,486
And here's some cash.

279
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,534
This is for you.

280
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:01,162
- No, Pablo. I don'<i>t want</i> your money.
- It's for your help.

281
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,252
I'm doing this for you.

282
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,768
Thank you.

283
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:31,776
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

284
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:39,701
(Pablo sighs)

285
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:55,133
(In Spanish)
You guys can'<i>t</i> do shit to me.

286
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:59,012
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

287
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,765
That's right.

288
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:06,227
But you have to talk to get <i>it.</i>

289
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:08,772
You want to negotiate, gringo?

290
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:11,775
You want to negotiate?
Let's negotiate.

291
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,028
I'll give you something.
Something small.

292
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:16,654
Blackie...

293
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,958
What name did your mother give you?

294
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,631
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

295
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:36,257
(Javier) Lucumí?

296
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:41,054
From the Pacific.

297
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,435
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

298
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:51,564
On your jacket, everywhere.

299
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,792
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

300
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,672
Hey...

301
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:21,928
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know <i>that.</i>

302
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:26,808
We know it wasn'<i>t</i> your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

303
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:34,566
Don'<i>t</i> let them blame you for this.

304
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:39,696
Don'<i>t</i> let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

305
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:47,370
Help us and we'll help you.

306
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,251
- Give us Pablo.
- (Scoffs)

307
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:57,422
No fucking way.
I can'<i>t</i> give you Pablo.

308
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,675
No fucking way I give you the boss.

309
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,720
Then give us something.

310
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,807
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

311
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:18,276
I'll give you...

312
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,905
...La Quica.

313
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,786
Faggots.

314
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,226
There's a lot of them.

315
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:57,273
You think we can take all of them?

316
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:02,403
What's wrong, brother?
You're turning into a pussy.

317
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,700
If you're scared,
why don't you run away?

318
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,703
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

319
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:13,373
No, brother.

320
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,418
I'm loyal to the boss.

321
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,631
And if I have to die,
I'll die, brother.

322
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:24,050
You better, motherfucker.

323
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,556
(Steve) This is the biggest lead
we've ever had.

324
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:33,226
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

325
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,353
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

326
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:38,856
So that means that we have
to drive around Medellín

327
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,025
hoping to get lucky
and La Quica's using his phone?

328
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,278
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

329
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:46,698
He picks up, we get a signal.

330
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:49,617
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

331
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,870
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

332
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:56,499
Okay. And who else has his number?

333
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:01,754
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

334
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,592
Just us.

335
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,180
Okay.

336
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:13,975
- Trujillo.
- (In Spanish) Yes, Colonel.

337
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,852
(In Spanish)
Prepare the emergency team.

338
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:18,354
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

339
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:21,649
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

340
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,819
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

341
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:26,946
(Hugo Jr) At your service, Colonel.

342
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,422
(In Spanish)
Good work on Blackie.

343
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,427
I need to know you didn'<i>t</i> make the call.

344
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:55,850
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

345
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,478
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

346
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:01,230
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

347
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:05,193
But not with them.

348
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:09,739
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

349
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:14,494
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

350
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,880
- (Man) Good evening, Ms Velez.
- Good evening.

351
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,007
Welcome, they're expecting you.

352
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,722
(Hermilda)
What is she doing here?

353
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,895
I sent for her.

354
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,481
Take the children to their room.

355
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,609
Please.

356
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,570
(Hermilda) Let's go. Let's go.

357
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,752
This is from Pablo.

358
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,716
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

359
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:15,555
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

360
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,143
You must keep it hidden.

361
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,107
He also sent you money.

362
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,198
Thank you.

363
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:47,336
Well, let's do the interview.

364
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:53,634
You know what? Another time.

365
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:57,138
When all of this is over.

366
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,029
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can'<i>t</i> leave so quickly.

367
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,202
Then stay.

368
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,456
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

369
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:32,173
(Radio static)

370
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:34,342
(Tata) 'Pablo?'

371
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,473
Tata.

372
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,099
(Gasps)

373
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:44,310
Pablo, is it you?

374
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:47,939
So good to hear your voice, my love.

375
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:52,235
'How are you, Tata?'

376
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,279
How are our children?

377
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:57,615
My love, we're all okay.

378
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,617
'We need you.'

379
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,244
And I need you.

380
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,664
Listen, I'm going
to get you out of there soon.

381
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,375
'I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready...'

382
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,751
Shh.

383
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:11,921
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

384
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,466
I love you very much.

385
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:18,636
I love you, my darling.
I love you...

386
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,763
(Continues indistinctly)

387
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:42,034
Mr President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

388
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:46,622
Escobar will be brought to justice.

389
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:50,710
And once his family is out of Colombia,

390
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:55,089
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

391
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:58,634
- I already did <i>that.</i>
- Yes.

392
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,179
Well, I've got a list here

393
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:07,476
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

394
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:13,441
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

395
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:22,366
Attorney General De Greiff...
it seems you've been misinformed.

396
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:28,748
Escobar's family isn'<i>t</i> going anywhere.

397
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,251
Pardon me?

398
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:34,920
I won'<i>t</i> lift a finger
to find them asylum.

399
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:40,134
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

400
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,054
Do you know what that means?

401
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,431
There will be no surrender.

402
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:48,893
The violence will not end.

403
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:52,646
And you will be the one responsible.

404
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:56,275
You... will be the one responsible.

405
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:01,697
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

406
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:03,532
while making him stronger.

407
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:09,288
This, Mr De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

408
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,749
This...

409
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:16,170
This ends with his death.

410
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:22,259
(Pacho) 'No, you don'<i>t</i> need to worry
about anything.'

411
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:26,305
Put yourself at ease. We got <i>it.</i>

412
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:31,310
'Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.'

413
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,150
(Knocking at door)

414
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,823
- (In English) Hi, there.
- (In Spanish) How's it going?

415
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:48,953
- What's up, little Lion?
- Doing good. Just hanging out.

416
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:51,080
Is everything packed or what?

417
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,335
I don'<i>t</i> get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

418
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,546
I would've thought that Pacho Herrera

419
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:02,591
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles...

420
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:04,927
(Grunting and gasping)

421
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,681
(* Turns volume up)

422
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,369
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

423
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:31,912
(Hermilda) I'll take more.

424
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,914
(Sirens wailing)

425
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:04,236
PABLO'S WHORE

426
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:14,872
(Pablo) So my business is done?
Is that right?

427
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:17,541
I can'<i>t</i> get anyone on the phone, sir.

428
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:22,254
I called many times. Many times.

429
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:27,259
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

430
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,270
(Tata on radio) 'Pablo!'

431
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:47,988
Tata?

432
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:51,825
'Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.'

433
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,369
'Who?'

434
00:33:56,455 --> 00:33:58,165
Valeria.

435
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,300
Are you all okay?

436
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:12,137
'Yes, we're okay.'

437
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:13,764
Listen...

438
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:17,643
'I need you to be strong.'

439
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:22,565
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

440
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:25,776
'L'll call you back soon.

441
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,611
'I love you very much.'

442
00:34:27,736 --> 00:34:29,530
(Line disconnects)

443
00:34:37,204 --> 00:34:42,334
Tonight... we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

444
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:47,089
We'll fight with everything we have.

445
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,635
Fuck the Cali cartel!

446
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,387
Fuck Judy Moncada!

447
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:55,931
Fuck Los Castaños!

448
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:59,560
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

449
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:02,688
because we're still the Medellín cartel

450
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:07,276
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

451
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:14,033
Bring all the men we can buy.

452
00:35:14,158 --> 00:35:18,829
Go to Medellín
to every money stash we have

453
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:21,373
and bring me every penny you can find.

454
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:24,710
Limón and Quica will take me
to Montecasino,

455
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:30,633
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

456
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:33,927
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallóns,

457
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:37,681
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

458
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:39,683
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

459
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:41,852
Boss...

460
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:48,192
I think I should go with Rojas.
It's too dangerous.

461
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,574
Okay.

462
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,952
Take Ricardo with you.

463
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:03,499
As you wish, boss.
Let's go, brother.

464
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:08,587
- Let's go, go, go!
- Quickly!

465
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,506
(Engines revving)

466
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:13,842
(Man) Let's go!

467
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,435
Let's go! Let's go!

468
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:42,287
There. After that corner, right there.

469
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:50,212
What are the odds
that we survive tonight?

470
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:55,759
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

471
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,554
Let's do this quickly.

472
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:07,312
(Steve) 'With Hugo Jr.'s RDF
surveillance team using Blackie's phone,

473
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:11,358
'we had a real chance of tracking
La Quica. We just needed a little luck.'

474
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:15,529
- (In Spanish) I think we're ready.
- We've cast as wide a net as possible.

475
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:18,449
(Steve in English over radio)
'Guys, are we good?'

476
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:21,702
- Go ahead.
- (Hugo Jr) 'Go ahead, Murphy.'

477
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:24,121
Copy that.
Centra Spike, you standing by?

478
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:29,376
(Edward) 'We are in the air.
Condition one, Murphy. Make your call.'

479
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:33,046
(Steve) 'All we had to do was call him,
hope he was in the area,

480
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:35,799
'pray he picked up
and then keep him on the line

481
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:38,677
'long enough for our triangulation
to pick up the ping.

482
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:43,682
'And then snatch him up
without getting killed. Easy, right?'

483
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:45,058
(Ringing)

484
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:48,520
(In Spanish) Hello? Hello?

485
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:52,858
'I can't hear you. Hello, hello?'

486
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,403
Damn it!

487
00:37:58,155 --> 00:37:59,656
It was him.

488
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,493
(Ricardo in Spanish) Let's go.

489
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:06,246
(Rojas) Let's go to 10th and 32nd Street.

490
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,544
(Edward) 'I need him on longer, guys.'

491
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,381
Get him back on the phone.
Keep him on.

492
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:19,927
(Phone rings)

493
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,181
Answer it.

494
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,937
Fucking answer it!
It could be the boss.

495
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,688
(La Quica) 'Hello?'

496
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:35,609
Quica... Hello.

497
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:38,570
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

498
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:42,407
- Quica, how's it going, my friend?
- 'Motherfucker. Who is this?'

499
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:47,287
(Javier) 'Calm down, Quica.
Don'<i>t</i> be nervous. What's up, Quica?'

500
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:49,832
Who the fuck
do you think you are, bitch?

501
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,752
(Edward) 'Guys, we got a hit!
He's in Laureles.

502
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:56,547
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

503
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:15,148
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

504
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:19,987
(Radio static)

505
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:26,243
- Murphy, Peña, one more time.
- Copy, copy. We're calling again.

506
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:30,664
(Phone rings)

507
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,295
Hello?

508
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:39,715
(Javier in Spanish)
'Quica. What's up, Quica?'

509
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,302
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

510
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:45,721
- 'What are you up to, Quica?'
- Bastard.

511
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,229
You're the accountant.
How much is there?

512
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,398
I don't know, maybe $500,O00.

513
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:03,238
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

514
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,324
So funny.

515
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:07,075
Why aren'<i>t</i> you watching the car?

516
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:21,924
Sorry, but this toss of the coin...
doesn'<i>t</i> seem like a good idea to me.

517
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:23,800
Let's make a deal...

518
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:43,195
(Javier) Motherfucker.
Here we go.

519
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,821
(Tyres screeching)

520
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:55,624
(Steve) We got eyes on La Quica,
travelling in a blue Sedan, heading east.

521
00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:56,792
Go right.

522
00:40:58,043 --> 00:40:59,461
Pussies.

523
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:18,855
He's making a right <i>oncalle cuatro.</i>
All units!

524
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:20,691
Copy that! We're on it!

525
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:26,863
Trujillo, double back on my six.

526
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,909
Perez, close all of 4th Street.
Go this way to cut him off.

527
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,043
Come on, pussy.

528
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:49,970
- There! Follow him!
- (Car honks)

529
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:54,391
Follow him! Follow him! Follow him!
To the right, the right!

530
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,604
- Come on, box him in!
- All units, be ready for the play.

531
00:42:12,701 --> 00:42:14,411
(Men shout in Spanish)

532
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:19,541
Stop!

533
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,877
(Steve) 'Now I have my own history
with La Quica,

534
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:25,464
'and believe me, I would've liked
to beat him to death right then and there.

535
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:27,841
'And I bet nobody would've cared.

536
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:31,344
{\an8}'La Quica's exploits were legendary.

537
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,430
'He was Escobar's most prolific killer,

538
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:36,933
'and the guy credited for putting
the Avianca bomber on the plane.

539
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:39,269
'But he was also his most trusted guy.

540
00:42:39,394 --> 00:42:43,940
'And if we could get him to flip,
that would close the book on Pablo.'

541
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:04,544
(Sighs heavily)

542
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:28,360
(Pablo) Limón.

543
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:30,654
Relax.

544
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:32,948
(Limón zips case shut)

545
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:34,658
Okay, boss.

546
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,412
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

547
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:41,665
I think we have enough.

548
00:43:46,086 --> 00:43:48,421
La Quica isn'<i>t</i> answering, boss.

549
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:56,388
Okay.

550
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,143
Go and start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

551
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:02,769
Yes, sir.

552
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:33,068
(In English)
Where is the staging point for this raid?

553
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:35,153
(Javier in Spanish)
Where's the staging area?

554
00:45:35,278 --> 00:45:39,658
You want me to hand you information,
just like that? Free?

555
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:44,037
No, brother. I want a deal.

556
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:48,625
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

557
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,419
I want something different.

558
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:55,215
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

559
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,010
(In English) He says he wants
a new life in the US of A.

560
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:03,932
You give us Pablo Escobar,
and I'll take you there myself.

(Slams table)

562

(Javier in Spanish)
We don'<i>t</i> have time for bullshit.

563
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:15,277
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

564
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:22,951
If you don'<i>t</i> give us something fast,
of substance,

565
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:28,915
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United <i>States...</i> but extradited.

566
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,377
- Extradition doesn'<i>t</i> exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

567
00:46:32,502 --> 00:46:36,673
With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

568

(Steve) 'The narcos always
talk about loyalty,

'Hello. Where are you, boss?'

573

I'm en route. And you?

574
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:25,555
'Me too. I'm not too far off.'

575
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:35,065
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

576
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:42,405
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

577
00:47:44,282 --> 00:47:48,161
Boss, Ricardo went to get
one last stash.

578
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:50,538
He's on his way.

579
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:54,959
Want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

580
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:04,511
Yes, we're almost there.

581
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:20,235
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón's driving.

582
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:24,823
(Javier) Now give us
the staging point.

(Pablo) Pull over.

584
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,502
Give me a moment.

585
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:40,296
Okay. Sure, boss.

You may not hear from me
for a while.

591

What's happening, Pablo?
What are you going to do?

592
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:16,332
Something I have to do.

593

'But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?'

594
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:28,761
I know.

(In Spanish) Fuck.

601
00:51:07,068 --> 00:51:08,111
Got something.

602
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:11,739
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

603

All right. Let the women through.

Stand by, everyone.
This isn'<i>t</i> happening tonight.

What will happen with Quica, boss?

614
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:37,116
Quica's gone, Limón.

They're all gone.
