A cavalry horse. (LAUGHING)

164
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,730
He got... He gets it.

165
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,283
Fuck it. Fuck it.

Where the bloody hell are they?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

167
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,410
You're best man, Arthur.
Go and find them.

168
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,481
Yeah.

169
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,290
ADA: That's completely nonsense.

170
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,409
You know, we're part of a serious
political movement and organisation.

171
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,802
They're not "secret little meetings,"
they're just meetings.

172
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,008
We talk about the world,
about the people in it,

173
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,970
about our current political landscape
and what's going on.

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,088
You know, we really need to re-evaluate
the way our government...

- He's looking over.

177
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,561
What?

178
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,848
He's coming. He bloody is.

179
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,928
Fuck. It's the wrong one.

180
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,284
What do you mean "the wrong one"?
How many are there?

181
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,964
There's two, giving me the eye.

182
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,008
I prefer the other one.
He looks harmless.

183
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,604
It must be that bloody lipstick
Tommy brought you back from New York.

184
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,691
I couldn't help noticing
you are unaccompanied.

185
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,321
I also am alone. May I join you?

ARTHUR: Tommy?
Oh. (SNIFFLES)

187
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,646
Didn't see a thing. Did not see a thing.
Sorry, brother.

188
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,125
I need you downstairs.

189
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,210
It's all right. We're done. (SIGHS)

190
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,486

- Yeah.

191
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,925
- Never been better.
- Yeah?

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,604
- Are you drunk?
- Huh? No.

193
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,401
No.

194
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,361
Here.

195
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,768
All right, it's just one drink, then.

196
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,089
Linda's a good woman, Arthur.

197
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,881
Good whisky.

198
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,687
A good man needs to
hold out sometimes, eh?

199

(SIGHS)

200
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,209
So, uh, do I mention this
in my speech, then, eh?

201
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,806
Not unless you want to get cut, Arthur.

202
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,211
ARTHUR: Sorry, sister.

203
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,811
TOMMY: Right. Look.

204
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,488
Tell the maids
to break out the champagne.

205
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,925
We'll be down in a minute.

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,002
Champagne, yeah. OK.

207
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,207
- I got it right here. I'm ready.
- Good. Good.

208
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,090
Where are you from?

209
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,727
I'm a refugee.

210
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,441
From where?

211
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
Russia.

212
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,561
In the past few months,

213
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,450
Thomas has developed
some business interests with Russia.

214
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,528
I see he has confided in you.

215
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,967
Hmm.

216
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,566
You need his permission
to even speak to me.

217
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,851
My senior position
within the Shelby company

218
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,561
means I don't often have
to ask permission from anyone

219
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,051
to do anything.

220
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,484
So perhaps you'll just tell me

221
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,009
why the fuck you're talking Russian
business on Thomas's wedding day.

222
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,121
LIZZIE: Hold on, wait a second. So
you're saying I'm not allowed a man...

223
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,531
It's about your choice of man.

224
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,761
LIZZIE: I'm not allowed a man on my arm?

225
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,285
MICHAEL: Thomas says
that they're the rules.

226
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,283
LIZZIE: Fucking parish bastard!

227
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,761
Michael, speeches. Come on.

228
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,684
Arthur. You know
why he didn't come, don't you?

229
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,125
Why who didn't come?

230
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,611
My bloody man.

231
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,205
Oh, you mean the wop?

232
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,490
LIZZIE: I just heard there was a fire
at his restaurant midnight last night.

233
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,006
And a smashed back window
and a smell of petrol.

234
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,211
Lizzie, we tried to talk some sense
into you.

235
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,006
We did checks on him.

236
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,003
He's had five different names
in the last six years,

237
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,730
and he's got connections
with the Naples boys.

238
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,801
ARTHUR: Come on, Michael.

239
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,291
What do you know about love?

240
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,169
About when lightning strikes.

241
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,006
So, it was lightning, hmm? Not petrol.

242
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,366
I thought you were
off the whisky, Arthur.

243
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,886
Yeah, I am. Having a couple
now and again

244
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,325
to remind myself why I don't drink it.

245
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,447
(CHUCKLES)

246
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,444
You set fire to his restaurant
to stop him coming.

247
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,729
You have no right to choose
who I step out with in my own time!

249
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,487
Lizzie, you now have an important
position in this company.

250
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,609
You got the order, same as us.

251
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,409
You can do it.

252
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,248
Until further notice...

253
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,681
No fraternizing with the foreigners.

254
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,925
Yeah, well, you can tell Tommy from me

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,651
all the girls in the office think
he's losing his fucking mind!

256
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,691

- The bride.

And now, (CLEARS THROAT)
according to tradition,

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,001
my best man will say a few words.

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,081
Go on! Here he goes! Go on, Arthur!

262
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,609

I'm not one for speeches.

But, er... I do, er...

265
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,685
I do have some words written down here

266
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,210
on this piece of paper.

267
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,401
This doesn't include everything
that I want to say.

268
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,608
Arthur, just, uh...
just read what we wrote down, eh?

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,963
- I will. I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

But...

271
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,644
First... First, uh, a few words from...
From the heart.

Um...

This man here, my brother Tommy,

Arthur, you mustn't worry about
