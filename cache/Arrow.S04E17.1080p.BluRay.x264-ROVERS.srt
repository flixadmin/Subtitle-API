1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,491
Previously on Arrow and Flash...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,365
<i>Brie Larvan, a quite brilliant roboticist</i>

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,603
who once developed miniature
mechanical bees for military use.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,367
Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency.
I'm controlling them.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,204
- Brie's restrained.
- Boom!

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,691
It's an implantable bio stimulant.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,888
This little piece of technology
is gonna help me walk again?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,889
After it's implanted in your spine. Yes.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,641
I found Quentin Lance's testimony
to be particularly compelling.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,529
<i>On the strength of it,</i>

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,281
<i>Mr. Darhk will be held without bail
or possibility of release.</i>

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,722
It is too hard to be here
with you every night and not be with you.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,564
I don't wanna let you go.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,444
But I'm already gone.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,165
Computer time's up, blondie.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,321
Don't think so.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,643
The judge granted me
a minimum of 30 minutes per week.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,285
I have 90 more seconds.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,283
The judge ain't here. lam.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,167
Let's see what you're so hot for
without an Internet connection.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,481
Bees.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,405
I like bees.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,530
Thea, your back foot's sliding out.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,250
No, it's not!

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,008
Just because you can't see me,
doesn't mean I'm not there.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,044
You've got to sense my presence,
even when I'm not in your eye-line.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,362
What advice would you give to me?

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,567
Humor me.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,051
Getting tired,
you're dropping your shoulder

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,361
and you're opening yourself up.

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,729
So you took your morning run
from six miles, to what?

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,365
Maybe two?

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,206
Yeah, well, taking care of
a toddler is a marathon in itself.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,930
Right, but when you sacrifice
your endurance,

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,526
you're losing steam too early
in our sessions.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,569
Let's go again. 41lpass.

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,206
I keep on running out of excuses
for all my new bruises.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,846
And they're from you, not bad guys.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,846
The streets have gone quiet
since we took Darhk off the board.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,606
His organization hasn't been.
HIVE is still out there.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,649
Yeah. And when they rear their head,
we'll take care of them,

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,801
but we have to celebrate our victories.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,287
If we don't,
we forget what we're fighting for.

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,010
What's wrong?

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,401
Alex has a new job interview.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,247
- With Ruvé Darhk.
- What?

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,762
She's looking for a new chief of staff
for the April 6th election.

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,921
Oh, still don't know see
why you just can't

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,127
put yourself back in the race, Oliver.

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,727
You know, voters, they hate flip-flopping
and that would be a pretty big one.

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,521
I can't let him work for the wife
of the prince of darkness.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,165
And what if he got a better offer?

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,685
Are you gonna run for mayor?

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,285
Palmer Tech.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,648
They're hiring
a new head of public relations.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,881
Oh.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,762
I just heard that from someone.

58
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,080
Laurel, she's not Voldemort.

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,886
And I'm fine.

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,522
That's a good idea.
You should tell Alex to talk to Felicity.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,761
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,881
- What?
- Nothing. It's just...

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,807
What, it's shocking
that you know who Voldemort is.

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,564
Well, I mean,
I'm not immune to pop culture.

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,171
I read a few of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,688
Really? I was gonna bet Thea
that you just saw the movies.

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,770
There were movies?

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,567
Mr. Queen. Where are my men?

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,330
I don't know, Reiter.

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,891
They're your men.

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,322
I wasn't gonna wait around
for them to kill me.

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,801
And what of Ms. Venediktov?

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,891
She's still here.

74
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,970
Don't move.

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,920
- Where's my idol?
- It's not your concern anymore.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,771
It's nearby. I can feel it.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,241
The powers it bestowed
are on the wane, but...

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
Enough!

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,680
As I was saying,
the magics are losing their potency,

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,046
but I still have enough
to make short work of the two of you.

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,485
A quarter of a million dollars per unit.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,650
It's hard to believe something so small
could cost so much money...

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,681
When Digital Equipment Corporation
released the first VAX, it cost $700,000.

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,647
Honestly, I think of this as a bargain.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,290
Except we're not starting
a computer revolution here.

86
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,488
We're trying to repair spinal injuries.

87
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,248
The new estimate of spinal injuries
per year are at 12,000 people.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,367
Unless everyone's a billionaire,
walking again is a luxury item.

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,885
Sounds like something
Mr. Dennis would say.

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,121
He already has.

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,520
He's called a board meeting to discuss

92
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,200
how many zeroes he can add
to the end of that price point.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,727
Anything I can do to help you?

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,928
No, you can't do anything with that cold.
Go home, get some rest.

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,081
Get some chicken noodle soup.

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,605
You sound like my mother.

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,807
Yeah, I'm sure if she was here,

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,043
she'd tell you to listen
to my favorite girl.

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,447
Hi, honey.

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,844
Fine, but only because my cold medication
is starting to make me see double.

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,491
- Aw...
- Help. Help me, help...

102
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,246
Did you hear that?
He thinks we look like twins.

103
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,606
I don't think that's what he said.

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,171
I think he did.

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,446
What can I help you with, Mom?

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,843
Well, my beautiful baby girl.
I am here to rescue you.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,764
- Oh.
- After the...

108
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,210
B-R-E-A-C-K-U-P.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,410
You could use some
regular socialization so...

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,450
How about leisurely lunch?

111
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,687
Oh, my God. I don't know what's worse.

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,366
The fact that you just spelled out breakup
or that you misspelled it.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
- Huh?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,490
- No.
- No, Mom. I'm fine.

115
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,801
I have a lot of work to do.

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,689
No. Just a quick one. Sweetie...

117
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,683
Sorry. Is this a bad time?

118
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,486
You people are like Tribbles today.
What's up? Everything okay with...

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,165
- Oliver?
- I was gonna say your night job.

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
You know, that thing that you do at night.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,404
Yeah, no, that... That's fine.

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,722
Ollie is fine too.

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,809
It's actually about Alex.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,122
Um, he's no longer working
on the campaign so I was...

125
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,203
Oh, my God, it's Mr. Dennis.

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,361
I have a board meeting.

127
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,444
You know what? He's a jerk. He can wait.

128
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,361
What did you wanna ask me about Alex?

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,802
You know,
usually someone buys me dinner

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,962
before we start breaking out the cuffs.

131
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,883
I thought you just lost your magic,
but your charm seems to be waning as well.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,405
How the hell did you get in here?

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,891
I used to be Ra's al Ghul.

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,041
Yes. This, I know.

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,651
What I'm less clear of,

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,371
is why my resources haven't been deployed
to get me out of here.

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,966
Well, that's what I'm here to explain.

138
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,642
Although my time in here
might be limitless, Malcolm,

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,801
my patience isn't.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,161
That's cute.

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,280
As I was saying,
I've been in touch with your resources

142
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,444
and they don't seem to have any particular
love left for you, Damien.

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,331
Something to do with hocus and pocus

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,285
and killing fellow members
when you get miffed.

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,763
HIVE is moving forward with Genesis
but not with you.

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,004
They like you here, out of trouble.

147
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,806
But they do wish you the best of luck
with your trial.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,841
Don't be embarrassed.

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,328
Performance issues are common
for men of your age.

150
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,927
Well, you really do have eyes
in the back of your head.

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,970
- I thought you had work to do.
- I realized it could wait.

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,044
You've been pushing us pretty hard
and I know why.

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,409
Oliver, it's okay to miss Felicity.

154
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,570
I... I appreciate what you're doing
but I don't think that you're the...

155
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,722
Person to help you through it?

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,126
Why?

157
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,201
- Because of what we used to have?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,004
But maybe,
it just gave me a little insight.

159
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,324
Well, I mean, in fairness,
I did wreck what we had too, so...

160
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,320
In your defense, you were missing
and presumed dead for five years,

161
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,363
but that's not what I mean.

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,723
I know how passionately you love

163
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,611
and how much it hurts
once that love goes away.

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,445
You know, between...

165
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,845
Merlyn, Slade Wilson and Ra's al Ghul,
I thought that I'd be a little...

166
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,965
Tougher than this by now.

167
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,202
That's a different type of pain.

168
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,842
And this takes longer to heal.

169
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,764
But I'm here for you.

170
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,726
Thank you.

171
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,925
You're not late, Phil.

172
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,287
We're still waiting on Ms. Smoak.

173
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,965
Are you all right?

174
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,849
Phil? Phil? Phil!

175
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,525
I'm calling 911.

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,122
I can't get a signal!

177
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,327
You'll have to excuse my tiny friends.

178
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,690
Their bee-havior can be
appalling sometimes.

179
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,081
But it's a necessary evil.

180
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,886
You see, I needed your full attention.

181
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,525
What the hell do you want?

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,251
Straight to the point. I like that.

183
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,964
Your CEO has miraculously recovered
from paralysis,

184
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,562
thanks to an implantable
bio-stimulant microchip.

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,285
Hand one over and I'll "bee" on my way.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,886
There's only one prototype.

187
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,082
The one inside Felicity Smoak.

188
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,201
So, what's a girl gotta do
to get on her calendar?

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,606
I can talk to Alex if you want,

190
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,564
but I can't promise a job
he'll be excited about.

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,445
Probably best to keep him away
from a super-villain's wife.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,331
Yep, you're right about that.

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,845
<i>Hello out there.</i>

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,001
What the hell?

195
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,083
<i>I am looking for Felicity Smoak.</i>

196
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,802
<i>Because it would be swell if we could chat
about a certain implantable bio-chip.</i>

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,280
<i>I'm sure your board would
really appreciate it.</i>

198
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,251
Brie Larvan.

199
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,408
- You know this wackadoodle?
- I had a run-in with her last year.

200
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,881
If this Brie Larvan is coming for you,
we need to get you out of here.

201
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,411
No, no, no.
No, I don't think she knew who I was.

202
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,561
She's after something else.

203
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,926
She said something about an implant.

204
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,242
A bio-stimulant microchip.
There's only one working prototype.

205
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,084
- Where is it?
- In the base of my spine.

206
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,447
Which brings me back to,
we need to get you the hell out of here.

207
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,090
But we have to get everyone out of here.

208
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,241
I can't even get a signal.

209
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,402
<i>She's jammed all communications.</i>

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,090
Oh, my God...

211
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,967
<i>Eyewitnesses report
the bees have been swarming</i>

212
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,645
<i>the Palmer Tech headquarters</i>

213
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,961
<i>for the past 20 minutes.</i>

214
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,361
<i>Now all communications in and out
of the building have been cut off.</i>

215
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,931
Have you seen this?

216
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,445
I was just there.

217
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,126
I'd still be there if Felicity hadn't...

218
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,250
Oh, my God. Felicity.

219
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,248
But you have 104 fever.
Where do you think you're going?

220
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,401
To get help.

221
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,767
I'm pretty sure the police
already know about this.

222
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,082
I'm not talking about the police.

223
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,648
<i>We are hearing that SCPD
has sent in an ESU squad.</i>

224
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,165
Felicity's in there.

225
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,687
Thea, too. I tried calling but no answer.

226
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,127
She must have already been inside
by the time the swarm hit.

227
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,051
John's coming in.

228
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,287
This is HIVE, right?

229
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,084
There's no way
that this bee attack is a coincidence.

230
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,642
I don't think it's HIVE
and I don't think those are bees.

231
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,925
No. Bees don't give off hundreds
of different kinds of radio frequencies.

232
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,406
Robot bees. Terrific.

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,282
Last year, Felicity helped Barry Allen
take down the bees' inventor, Brie Larvan.

234
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,527
So it's payback.

235
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,170
Well, Larvan picked
a hell of a day for it.

236
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,446
Donna is in there too.

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,329
- What?
- She stopped by Felicity's office to

238
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,562
you know, cheer her up a little.

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,806
Suit up.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

241
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,924
The departmentjust tried sending
in an ESU squad,

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,127
they couldn't get through that swarm.

243
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,884
Now if their Kevlar couldn't hold,

244
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,690
what makes you think that yours will?

245
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,126
We have to try.

246
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,043
<i>I am running out of patience,
Felicity Smoak.</i>

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,286
<i>You have 10 minutes
before I start voting board members out.</i>

248
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,610
<i>FYI, my drones pack a lot more "Ow!"</i>

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,129
<i>than your typical sting.</i>

250
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,921
<i>Tick, took-Tick, took.</i>

251
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,571
Okay, we need to get out of here.

252
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,404
But, Thea, the bees are out there...

253
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,130
Yeah, and sooner or later,
they're gonna be in here.

254
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,806
Okay, you know...
From now on, I'm going with flats.

255
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,803
<i>I mean, these assaults are weekly.
It's ridiculous.</i>

256
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,566
It's just so not conducive
to high fashion.

257
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,846
Okay, definitely sooner than later...

258
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,486
- What? We're trapped?
- Uh, I don't know.

259
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,045
- Not exactly.
- Okay.

260
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,371
Although I definitely don't have
the right shoes for that.

261
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,760
Oh, no, no, no.

262
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,604
Hello?

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,245
Anybody here?

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,411
Yes, we are here, Curtis.

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,291
And we just can't wait to hear
how you used the cell phone

266
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,683
that we gave you
to help us rescue Dr. Palmer

267
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,763
to track us back to our...

268
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,924
Secret lair.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,325
Okay, so we don't need to
take out the bees.

270
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,681
We just need to take out Larvan.

271
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,401
Yeah, well, it doesn't make much sense
if we can't get inside.

272
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,404
Holy frak...

273
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,926
You're the...

274
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,610
And wait, you're...

275
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,928
Wait, wait, wait, you-you're...

276
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,289
Uh, just so you guys know, if I pass out,

277
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,523
it's because I'm sick,
not because you know...

278
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,562
So can anybodyjust walk in here?

279
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,883
So you're the infamous Damien Darhk.

280
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,526
Oh, I get it.

281
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,921
You're big fans, aren't ya?

282
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,684
You want me to pose for a selfie?

283
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,241
Back in Star City, you were a big deal.

284
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,407
In here, the only big deal is him.

285
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,450
Gentlemen, I think
we're getting off on the wrong foot.

286
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,682
There must be some sort of way
that we can have...

287
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
WOW.

288
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,329
I'm sorry, I just gotta know,
did you sew that in yourself

289
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,211
or do you have like some kind of
lip sewing guy?

290
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,171
Stop right there!

291
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>Break it up!</i>

292
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,524
How did you deal with her
in the first place?

293
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,921
The old-fashioned way. Hacking.

294
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,844
I can't do that without
a working computer.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,526
Okay. Well, at least all we have to do
is wait for Ollie

296
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,727
and the rest of them to get here.

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,882
Just when I thought I was out.

298
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,202
I thought I left this all behind.

299
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,683
- Did you hear that?
- Bee.

300
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,682
Make that plural, bees,
in the air vents. Go!

301
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,726
Curtis?

302
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,331
Oh, this is so weird.

303
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,206
I literallyjust had a dream
where you were the Green Arrow.

304
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,323
Wait. This is happening.

305
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,045
- You're the Green Arrow?
- Yeah.

306
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,521
I could have sworn
it was Neal Adams in data processing.

307
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,366
And this is the Arrow cave.
Oh, my God.

308
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,723
Actually, we call it the bunk...
It's the bunker, but, yeah.

309
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,530
You're Laurel Lance, the ADA.

310
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,330
I've seen you on TV before.

311
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,209
And you're Captain Lance.

312
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,646
And you're...

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm sorry, I know I've met before

314
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,970
but I can't really place
your name right now...

315
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,010
Curtis, that's John Diggle.
I need you to focus for a second, please?

316
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,881
Oh, my God. This place is unbelievable.

317
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,003
I mean, you guys must be
drawing some crazy electricity.

318
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,686
How do you keep it off the grid?

319
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,811
This is STAR Labs 5000 Exostation.

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
What are the specs on this?

321
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,408
Curtis! Get it together.

322
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,364
Okay, now I'm starting to see
the whole Green Arrow thing.

323
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,045
And I'm actually starting
to feel better, too.

324
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,806
That's because we gave you
an IV to rehydrate you.

325
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,200
It should keep you going for a few hours.

326
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,522
Okay, forget the how for a second.

327
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,161
What are you doing here?

328
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,288
I saw the beehive on the news.
Felicity's in there.

329
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,204
Yeah, we were just about to mount
a rescue mission.

330
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,521
Do you guys even know what that is?

331
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,001
That is an army of robotic bees.

332
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,404
Yeah, that's my life now.

333
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,564
Brie Larvan. Apparently, she hacked
the prison computer network

334
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,842
and got herself an early release. Clever.

335
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,286
Feel free to use that by the way.

336
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,169
I mean, you can't put me
in front of this beautiful machine

337
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,129
and expect me not to
take it for a test drive.

338
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,171
Looks like Felicity keeps files on
various criminals. Who's The Dodger?

339
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,483
Looks like we have ourselves a taller,
more dude-like version of Felicity.

340
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,641
And I can help.

341
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,041
Now, look, these bees,
they're tiny computers, okay?

342
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,247
With Felicity trapped inside,

343
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,004
you guys are gonna need someone
to hack them,

344
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,680
but I'll have to "bee" careful.

345
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,684
- It's too soon for bee puns, right?
- Let's assume that it is.

346
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,126
- Yeah.
- Curtis,

347
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,284
can you immobilize enough bees
to give us a way in?

348
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,887
There's only one way to find out.

349
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,444
Do it.

350
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,847
You want me on the team? I mean...

351
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,567
- You want me on the team?
- Let's go.

352
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,889
Whoo!

353
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,722
You see now,
the value of my prize, Mr. Queen?

354
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,371
What have you done to yourself?

355
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,531
There are primordial energies
that flow through all things.

356
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,362
I now command them.

357
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,800
You're insane.

358
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,723
Madness is a matter of perspective,
Mr. Queen.

359
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,885
Your morality blinds you from
understanding what I have achieved.

360
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,570
No, I understand.

361
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,529
You're killing people to gain power.

362
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,682
And what will you do about it?

363
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,006
Now, tell me
where you have hidden my idol,

364
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,285
and I promise to kill you both quickly.

365
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,401
VVe1lpass.

366
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,327
Thank God.

367
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,205
Okay. How many are there?

368
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,842
Just try to think happy thoughts.

369
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Okay. Now it's time to hack some bees.

370
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,281
Okay, so that's what that button does.

371
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,441
Felicity...

372
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,326
<i>C U RTISI Felicity!</i>

373
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,481
Curtis?

374
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,641
<i>How do you know that bee's name?</i>

375
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,047
I did it! I hacked the...

376
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,800
Bees!

377
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,962
<i>How did you... What are you doing there?</i>

378
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,203
I know, right? I am still pinching myself.

379
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,766
All the bees are gone.

380
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,604
You're welcome.
The Green Arrow is on his way

381
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,364
as well as Black Canary and Spartan.

382
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,931
How cool is this?

383
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,010
Uh, they'll meet you
at the west utility entrance.

384
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,164
Can you get there?
Did I mention how cool this is?

385
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,965
Curtis, have you deactivated the bees?

386
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,003
Negative. Uh, I mean positive.

387
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,527
Sorry, I'm nervous. The bees are down.

388
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,281
Uh-oh.

389
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,050
Now it's a negative. Negative!

390
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,441
<i>The bees are back! I got kicked out!</i>

391
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,405
Ahhh!

392
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,002
Come on, they're okay.
Come on, get back inside. Back inside.

393
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,366
What the hell happened to him?

394
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,760
We couldn't see, I lost the feed.

395
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,206
He got stung.

396
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,366
Yeah, he's having some sort of reaction.

397
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,964
He didn't just get stung.

398
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,369
- The bee's inside you.
- Well, cut it out!

399
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,204
Do you guys have
anesthesia around here or something?

400
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,727
- Just do it!
- I can't find it, Oliver!

401
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,248
Okay, actually,
and this is hard to believe...

402
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,164
We have a bigger problem.

403
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,688
The bee is replicating itself.
Inside Oliver.

404
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,849
What did that thing do to the Green Arrow?

405
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,883
Stung him. Badly.

406
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,886
He'll be okay.

407
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,929
And he'll be back. So will the others.

408
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,445
How do you know?

409
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,410
Hon, they just got their butts kicked,
by that...

410
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,561
That bee man.

411
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,722
This is why
we leave the nicknames to Cisco.

412
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,564
- What?
- Inside joke.

413
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,607
Oh.

414
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,723
<i>I thought we were friends, Smoak.</i>

415
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,888
<i>That you were gonna come through.</i>

416
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,169
Ten minutes ago,
you had ten minutes to go.

417
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,330
<i>You're out of time, glasses.</i>

418
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,006
<i>Bee-cause we got interrupted,</i>

419
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,850
<i>I'm gonna give you
an additional five minutes</i>

420
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,243
<i>before I start taking
your board members off the board.</i>

421
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,243
Oh, and your fiancé looks awfully sweet.

422
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,087
<i>Sorry.</i>

423
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,090
<i>Ex-fiancé.</i>

424
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,241
Oh.

425
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,922
Okay, you cannot turn yourself in.

426
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,610
No, she'll kill everyone anyway.

427
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,366
To think she's in your office...

428
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,405
You're gonna have to sanitize.

429
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,085
Yes. She is in my office.

430
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,241
Which is A, yes, gross

431
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,526
but B, means
she's not with the board members.

432
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,569
You know,
since she brought up Oliver, honey,

433
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,767
have you spoken to him since everything...

434
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,921
Mom. Mom, Mom!

435
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,809
- I'm thinking!
- I'm sorry. You know what, honey?

436
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,883
I'm curious. Okay, I...

437
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,731
I have an idea.

438
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,721
It's not working!

439
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,405
You did it while we were at Palmer Tech.

440
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,204
The drone has evolved
and adapted since then.

441
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,566
And the damn things are like the Borg.

442
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,609
You know, the bad guys
in Star Trek which...

443
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,761
I wish Felicity was here.

444
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,331
Well, she's not, Curtis! You are!

445
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
You have to be able to do something, okay?

446
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,611
- When these things hit critical mass...
- It'll be like John Hurt in Alien.

447
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,603
Sorry, when I get nervous
I make pop-culture references.

448
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,489
Okay, you can't hack it out.
Can you lure it out?

449
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,165
Like some kind of...
I can't believe I'm saying this,

450
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,481
but some kind of digital honey
or something?

451
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,087
Not exactly. But if these are really
modeled after bees then...

452
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,322
They'll operate on a singular frequency
to orientate themselves.

453
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,403
If we can disrupt it,
then we can disperse the colony.

454
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,244
But, only problem is that
we need to generate

455
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,482
a high enough frequency
to damage their network.

456
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,645
But unless you guys have a portable
sonic projector handy, then, uh...

457
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,167
What?

458
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,965
This technology is amazing.

459
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,805
It reads your own vocal emissions
and then reprocesses it

460
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,689
via a digital output into a multichannel.

461
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,921
Yeah, we get it. It's badass.

462
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,082
But how is this going to help us
save Oliver?

463
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,611
Just give him a full Mariah Carey

464
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,286
and it should disrupt whatever connection
the bees are operating on.

465
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,204
All right, man. You sure about this?

466
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,966
We don't have time to be sure.

467
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,291
Curtis, do it!

468
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,328
Three, two, one...

469
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,683
That was awesome.

470
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,485
You son of a bitch.

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,241
My victory is inevitable, Mr. Queen.

472
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,009
Just think, all of this power came
from the life essence of one man.

473
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,401
Imagine what I will become

474
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,604
when dozens of lives
are sacrificed in my name.

475
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,161
You'll become a monster.

476
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,607
No. A god.

477
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,730
Let me show you.

478
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,362
No, I need more.

479
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,530
- You get 'em?
- Yeah.

480
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,882
They were in Curtis' office.
Right where you said they'd be.

481
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,247
Uh, no pun unintended.

482
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,449
This is like that thing from that, uh...
That Jodie Foster movie.

483
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,971
<i>Yeah. Uh, Panic Room?</i>

484
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,360
It's actually more like a lair.
Decommissioned.

485
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,641
But if we can get
the board members in there,

486
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
they can escape through a secret exit.

487
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,361
Secret exit?

488
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,883
Um, don't you think you should
have thought of that, like,

489
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,485
I don't know, 15 minutes ago?

490
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,642
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was busy trying not to die.

491
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,290
And you were talking, talking, talking.

492
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,965
Well, you don't open up to me, hon.

493
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,408
I have to force your feelings out of you
sometimes like...

494
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,324
- Like a pistachio.
- Okay, Smoaks.

495
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,084
We gotta go. Come on.

496
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,765
- Felicity...
- Mom.

497
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
No, I meant... Felicity!

498
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,004
Okay, we're moving...

499
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,241
I know. Hold on to something.

500
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,686
- What? Why?
- Why?

501
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,683
This elevator,
it only stops at the sub-level

502
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,604
and we need to stop it at...

503
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,411
Conference room floor.

504
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,807
Oh...

505
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,162
- I think we missed our stop.
- No, this is right.

506
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,368
Like I said,
the elevator doesn't stop at this level.

507
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,091
What? Um, honey,
I think this is a concrete wall.

508
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,089
Yeah, and these are explosive devices.

509
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,203
Actually, they're autonomous
communication devices.

510
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,124
I'm just really hoping that
Curtis hasn't figured out

511
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,850
how to stop them from exploding yet.

512
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,321
- Okay.
- Be careful.

513
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,965
Oh, my God. They're gonna blow.

514
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,451
- Okay.
- Oh, God!

515
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,051
Okay, who wants to go on
a secret elevator ride down to the, um...

516
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,009
- Panic room.
- Yeah, the panic room.

517
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,969
Come on.

518
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,281
Come on.

519
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,963
Trying to escape the hive?

520
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,561
Keep them safe.

521
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,848
Huh? What?

522
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,323
Beautiful creatures, my bees.

523
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,482
- They obey you?
- Neural implants.

524
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,371
You used to control them
the old-fashioned way.

525
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,010
How did you know that?

526
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,205
Lucky guess, I guess.

527
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,046
So why bees? Why not an obsession
with flying squirrels?

528
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,767
Squirrels aren't dying off
at a rate of 30% per year.

529
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,323
And nobody cares,
but bees are essential to life.

530
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,531
We're all connected.
The world is one giant honeycomb.

531
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,250
Kumbaya might have
a little more credibility

532
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,044
if you weren't threatening people's lives.

533
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,009
What, you mean like this?

534
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,682
I am running out of patience,
and your friend is running out of time.

535
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,569
Now give me the damn...

536
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,044
That was embarrassing.

537
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,362
I have a tumor on my L4 vertebrae.

538
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,523
The tricky little guy's wrapped
around my spinal cord.

539
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,602
The only way to cut it out
involves a surgery

540
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,282
that will leave me paralyzed
from the waist down.

541
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,762
All the bees in the world couldn't
get a cripple to walk.

542
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,566
And then I read about your miracle chip.

543
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,962
Of course...
I couldn't afford it.

544
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,246
Maybe if you asked nicely...

545
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,126
I want the microchip specs or your friend
relives my favorite scene from My Girl.

546
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,406
Okay, honey, we all have a sad sob story,
but killing people doesn't fix anything.

547
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,281
The blueprints are on a remote hard drive
in Curtis Holt's lab.

548
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,730
You are a smart girl.

549
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,324
Elastic nanotubes, ultrasonic motors,
piezo ceramic elements...

550
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,130
I mean, this bee's got everything.

551
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,770
That was inside me?

552
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,605
Well, that and thousands of its
microscopic larvae.

553
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,127
Don't worry. Should pass in a few days.

554
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,606
Can't wait.

555
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,245
Donna and the others made it out.

556
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,442
- Thea and Felicity?
- They're still inside.

557
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,250
Well, at least now we know
this stops the bees.

558
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,602
I wish it was that simple, but now
that we've played that card,

559
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,649
they've undoubtedly adapted to it.

560
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,770
But we just beat a group of robot bees
using a superhero doohickey,

561
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,524
and if that's not high-five worthy,
I don't know what is.

562
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,445
Curtis.
Now is not the time for high fives.

563
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,960
Sorry.
I, you know, just got excited and...

564
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,043
You know, you gotta celebrate the wins
when they come.

565
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,281
What?

566
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,328
Thea and Felicity are still trapped
inside Palmer Tech

567
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,641
with who knows how many more bees.

568
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,887
- We're not winning.
- Oliver...

569
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,008
So, if you're gonna be down here,
if you're gonna be with us,

570
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,164
then you need to understand the totality
of what it is you're signing up for.

571
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,449
If we do not do our jobs perfectly,
then people die!

572
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,684
And not just strangers but friends,
family and loved ones!

573
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,161
So think about that every time
you crack a joke

574
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,051
- or make light of what it is that we do!
<i>- Hey!</i>

575
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,568
Can I talk to you for a second?

576
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,687
Any puppies you wanna kick
while you're at it?

577
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,730
Bags of kittens that you wanna
throw down the river?

578
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,041
He needed to hear that.

579
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,362
Nobody needs to hear that, Oliver.

580
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,689
I know you're hurting, but you can't
take it out on Curtis.

581
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,043
I'm not taking it out on Curtis
I just need him to see.

582
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,846
- See what?
- That this is not a good life.

583
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,370
I walked away from it.

584
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,331
And I was happy.

585
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,209
For the first time in

586
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,721
eight years,

587
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,166
I was content.

588
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,402
- So why did you come back?
- I came back because of Felicity.

589
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,449
She convinced me that
we could do this job,

590
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,001
that we could save the city, and not...

591
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,568
Surrender to the darkness but...

592
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,691
I don't... I don't think that we can.

593
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,569
You're only saying that right now because
you're in 10 different kinds of pain.

594
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,407
But the harsh truth is that Felicity,

595
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,971
she broke up with you
because of your choices.

596
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,449
Because of the lies that you told.
You, Oliver. Not the Green Arrow.

597
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,687
I know.

598
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,767
It just doesn't seem fair that I can save
a city, and not save my relationship.

599
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,127
Oliver, life's not fair.

600
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,080
Whether you're in Star City or Ivy Town.

601
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,731
But you're right.

602
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,171
You can save this city.
You do it every night.

603
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,602
You're a beacon of hope to people.

604
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,965
I just wish that you would try and use
some of that hope for yourself.

605
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,441
Oh, hi, fellas.

606
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,484
You know, I usually frown upon walk-ins
but how can I help you?

607
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,048
No guards are coming to save you
this time, Darhk. We made sure of it.

608
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,124
Good. Because then he only
has to kill two of you.

609
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,531
I know you're probably asking yourself,

610
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,251
"Self, what the hell just happened?"

611
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,167
it turns out your friend,
my new friend, Mr. Amar,

612
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,130
has a soft spot for his
only surviving relative.

613
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,402
A grandmother in Monument Point.

614
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,010
It is amazing what people will tell you
with a few phone calls and a kind voice.

615
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Anyway, uh...

616
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,011
Are they dead? Are they dead?

617
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,208
No! I had this wonderful speech about how

618
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,762
I was gonna kill your grandmother
had you not killed them...

619
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,002
Never mind. On to other matters.

620
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,324
You many now call your organization
and have that other message delivered.

621
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,730
I thought we were locked out.

622
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,201
Well, we're gonna have to see
if I haven't lost my touch.

623
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,011
And I have to see if my mom
and the board members made it to safety.

624
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,328
You really shouldn't have given
Brie what she wanted.

625
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,211
I'm sick of people being put
in vulnerable positions.

626
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,601
Yeah, well, now there's nothing
stopping her from bringing those

627
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,966
bee things back on us.

628
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,727
Well, at the very least it buys us,
the team... Your team, time.

629
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,890
Ollie's gonna be fine.

630
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,726
He always is.

631
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,689
Well, unfortunately,
in Oliver's case "he always is"

632
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,081
isn't an accurate predictive metric.

633
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,369
I'm sorry. I'm just sick of worrying.
I'm sick of the violence...

634
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,040
Hey, so am I, okay? Of course I am.

635
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,566
But we put up with it, we push past it.

636
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,566
Because what we do is important, okay?

637
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,922
We have to be that beacon of hope.

638
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,926
Nobody else is.

639
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,809
You're the beacon of hope.

640
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,407
I quit the team because I couldn't
stand to work with Oliver, but...

641
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,609
But now that I'm out, I look at life from
a different perspective.

642
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,489
I mean, look around you.

643
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,321
Thea, we're in a Die <i>Hard</i> movie with bees.

644
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,042
Maybe I'm meant for great things, maybe
I'm not but whatever it is, it's not this.

645
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,807
I'm sorry. I'm not coming back.

646
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,321
Curtis...

647
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,286
You know, I'm beginning to see why
you and Felicity didn't work out.

648
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,001
Probably deserve that.

649
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,562
Look, I'm all for hugs and learning
but, like you said, there's still danger.

650
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,767
Yeah.

651
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,888
And you are a very scary man.

652
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,088
<i>Any luck with the bees?</i>

653
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,281
Curtis is doing his best.

654
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,726
Thanks, Laurel.

655
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,723
Now that I've been able to actually
examine the bee,

656
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,928
I've deciphered their upgrade protocol.

657
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,009
The next time they adapt,
I can upload a virus

658
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,605
that will disperse into the entire hive.

659
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,445
Like what <i>they did in
Independence Day, right?</i>

660
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,806
What? I can't watch movies too?

661
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,490
So what's the plan?

662
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,644
I rigged an arrow with
a computer virus payload.

663
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,484
Shoot it near one of Bee Arthur's minions,

664
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,321
the virus will transmit to the rest
of the colony and we're done.

665
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,565
That's nice work.

666
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,450
Uh...

667
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,322
Wait until it works before
you congratulate me.

668
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,649
I'm in. I mean, I'm out.
I mean, I have Internet.

669
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,802
- Mom and the board members, they're okay.
- What about us?

670
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,007
I'm working on overriding the bees,

671
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,446
the ones that are outside
guarding the building.

672
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,090
<i>Don't bother.</i>

673
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,966
These blueprints will be useful.
Thanks for those.

674
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,686
You have what you want.
So go build it yourself!

675
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,569
I think we're confused.

676
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,611
To get the schematics, I had to tip-toe
through Palmer Tech's computer network.

677
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,367
And I saw some
very familiar computer code.

678
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,404
You never forget the hacker
who sent you to prison.

679
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,407
Hi...

680
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,641
We're clear.

681
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,165
At least
there's no signs of the bees.

682
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,607
Go!

683
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,089
Looks like your green friend
didn't forget about you.

684
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,520
Never will.

685
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,490
- Hey, are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

686
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,880
Hey! Behind you!

687
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,324
There you go. Team Arrow,

688
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,363
which I am now a member of, pinch me,

689
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,605
I need a few more minutes to hack this
latest firewall the bees adapted.

690
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,882
I thought you were a better shot.

691
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,601
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

692
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,966
Got you.

693
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,440
Nice.

694
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,329
What is that?

695
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,360
Ew!

696
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,802
Don't worry, I won't tell
anyone you screamed.

697
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,530
Oh, right.

698
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,961
Thank you.

699
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,964
You never, never have to thank me.

700
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,726
If I can't walk, you can't live.

701
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,767
Who should I kill first? A or "bee"?

702
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,724
<i>Guess who's back in control?</i>

703
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,282
It's me, Curtis. In case you guys
don't recognize my voice yet.

704
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,966
No. No, no.

705
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,207
Lay down, bee-yotch.

706
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,885
Too on the nose?

707
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,405
The bee came alive and, well,

708
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,325
things got a little out of hand.
But don't worry, it's dead now.

709
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,847
You did good, Curtis. And I'm...

710
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,286
I'm sorry if I made you feel differently.

711
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,611
Thanks, GA.
You mind if I call you GA?

712
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,808
All right, yeah, I'll just stick
to Oliver then.

713
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,964
Or Mr. Queen. What about Larvan?
What's gonna happen to her?

714
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,646
She's at Starling General.
Overdosed on toxins from the bees

715
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,165
and is in some sort of a coma.

716
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,762
More importantly, she's no longer
holding a dozen innocent hostages.

717
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,287
That's both comforting and horrifying
at the same time.

718
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,965
Welcome to our world.

719
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,241
Hey...

720
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,169
ls everything all right?

721
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,085
Yeah, you know, I should probably
just head home.

722
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,242
You know, learning that
you are, you know, you

723
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,687
and the murderous bees,
and this coma news...

724
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,370
It's just a lot to digest.

725
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,727
Plus the IV you guys gave me
is starting to wear off.

726
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,366
Well, you are always welcome here, Curtis.

727
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,161
Just keep the property damage to
a minimum next time.

728
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,369
- Okay.
- All right.

729
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,640
- What's the exit?
- Right there.

730
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,564
On, yeah.

731
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,601
Hey. Nice apology.

732
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,770
Well, I'm just trying to
be a beacon of hope.

733
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,122
And like you said, save a little bit
of that hope for myself.

734
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,003
Taiana. Hey, hey.

735
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,560
All right. All right. Hey, Jesus.

736
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,290
Come on, come on.

737
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,365
Oh, thank God. Hey, Taiana, wake up. Hey.

738
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,806
Oliver...

739
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,770
It's okay. You're okay...

740
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,046
- No.
- It's all right.

741
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,565
No, Reiter...

742
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,446
He's gone.

743
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,131
He must be in the tunnels
searching for his idol.

744
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,441
We can't let him find it.

745
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,608
If he's in the tunnels,
searching for his idol,

746
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,127
that means he's not going to the prison.

747
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,169
This our chance to save your friends.

748
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,089
And what of Reiter's men?

749
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,044
They are still up there.

750
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,411
That's why we're gonna
kill all of them first.

751
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,684
I don't suppose it's too late
to reheat that soup?

752
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,605
Where have you been? You bolted
out of here like a crazy person.

753
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,724
Like some kind of a superhero
off to save the day.

754
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,367
I was chasing some silly fantasy
that I can help the police.

755
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,400
It was scary and thrilling and
dangerous and... Did I mention scary?

756
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,764
The... The point is, is that I saw enough

757
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,407
to know that this is where I belong.

758
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,970
At home, with you.

759
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,128
So no more disappearing acts?

760
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,681
I promise.

761
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,128
Let's get you some of that soup.

762
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,450
Terrific.

763
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,367
Maybe I should burn
some incense in here or something.

764
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,241
Probably a very good idea.

765
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,649
Remind me to never wear
black and yellow ever again.

766
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,766
Wait, where'd your mom go?

767
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,285
Oh, Captain Lance drove her home.

768
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,807
Yeah, that is something I'll never
be able to wrap my brain around.

769
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,122
Kinda cute.

770
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,285
Don't you miss this?

771
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,210
I mean, I... I know you said that you
wanted to get away from it all but...

772
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,446
How could you?

773
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,047
What do you mean?

774
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,720
This. The thrill of this. The rush.

775
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,527
I mean, we just took down
a bad "bee-yotch" tonight.

776
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,250
It doesn't get any better than this.

777
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,243
I was never in it for that.

778
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,441
Not ever.

779
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,242
I wanted to make a difference.

780
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,131
Be part of that
beacon of hope you speak of.

781
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,726
So come back.

782
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,011
Rejoin the team.

783
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,202
I think I figured out another way.

784
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,044
It's actually that insane bee lady
who gave me the idea. Ironically.

785
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,124
To remake this company.

786
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,405
To use the technology that
helped me walk again

787
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,562
to make people's lives better.

788
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,282
To make Palmer Tech
into the beacon of hope.

789
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,683
Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned
our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk.

790
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,649
But he reached out to me.

791
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,810
Told me about you.

792
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,570
He said you were his ace in the hole.

793
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,806
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

794
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,240
Or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?

795
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,841
