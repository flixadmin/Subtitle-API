1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,248
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,962
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,960
Survive.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,680
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,281
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,568
- Make it home. Right my wrongs.
- No!

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,445
To use the list of names he left me...

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,444
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,762
To do this,
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,206
I must become something else.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,248
Get down. Everybody keep down.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,402
Nobody lift their head,
nobody gets hurt.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,681
- Get down!
- Down.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,207
- Get on the floor right now!
- Go.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,051
You can't jackhammer into the safe.
It's too thick.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,766
Shut up.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,606
- Move. Move. Go.
- We're through.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,285
Three minutes.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,209
Are you trying to get us killed?

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,443
Don't worry. I'm a cop.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,444
Please don't do anything, okay?

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,882
I don't wanna die. Please.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,121
What hell's going on?

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,965
He was a freaking cop.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,443
Enough throwing shots.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,606
You hear that?

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,205
Someone triggered the alarm.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,527
Don't. That's it. Let's go.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,929
Starling City Police Department.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,686
Lay down your weapons
and come out with your hands up.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,884
Repeat, lay down your weapons
and come out with your hands up.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,444
Hold your fire.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,080
Move those hostages.
Mills, contain the hostages.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,641
All other units, move in, move in.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,330
Come here. You shot a cop.
This is not how we do things.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,891
Me getting killed
isn't how we do things.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,964
Get in the van. Get in the van!

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,485
Go.

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,571
Anchor the rear hand, Diggle.
Come on.

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,245
Okay.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,604
Variable acceleration.
Fighters work at the same pace.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,922
You switch it up,
throw your opponent off his game.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,930
That was nice.
Where'd you learn that?

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,770
His name was Yao Fei.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,931
- Did he give you those scars?
- One of them.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,282
And the others?

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,489
One day you're gonna be straight
with me about what really happened.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,449
Absolutely.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,801
But not today.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,964
Still, some pretty sweet moves.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,327
Yup. Tonight I'm gonna use
some on him.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,241
Scott Morgan runs Water & Power
in the Glades.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,767
Jacks up the prices
when people can't pay...

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,446
...shuts them down
even in the dead of winter.

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,171
Which is at least a month away.
Look at this.

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,121
These guys started in Keystone
three years ago.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,721
Began moving west,
hitting banks along the way.

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,486
This morning,
they hit Starling City Trust.

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,283
Shot an off-duty cop. He's in a coma.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,966
Doctors say it's a coin-toss
whether he'll make it.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,487
If he's a cop, S.C.P.D. will be over it.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,722
Overwhelmed, underfunded.

63
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,924
These guys don't hit one time,
they hit two or three per city.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,082
Right now they're planning
their next job.

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,641
You have the wrong impression
about what I do.

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,247
- Take out bad guys with bow and arrow.
- I don't fight street crime.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,927
That's a symptom of what's wrong in
this city. I'm trying to cure the disease.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,651
CEOs and crooked entrepreneurs.
I get it.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,962
Listen, Oliver, I'm just saying...

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,966
...you can make a difference if you think
beyond the scope of those pages.

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,203
- I'm sure your father wouldn't mind.
- No, you don't get it.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,169
My father died so that I could live.

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,370
Make a difference by fixing the city that
he and the people in this book ruined.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,683
Every name I cross off this list
honors that sacrifice.

75
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,842
There's more than one way
to save this city.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,610
Not for me.

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,570
Crime happens in this city every day.

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,769
What do you want me to do?
Stop all of it?

79
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,884
It sounds like you have
a narrow definition of being a hero.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,045
I'm not a hero.

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,764
Dad?

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,485
Tell me that this is a nightmare
and I'm about to wake up.

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,650
How can Stagg Industries pull out
completely? They're our largest donor.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,087
It's like they say,
"it's the economy, stupid."

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,481
No, it's the stupid economy.

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,450
Okay, without Stagg, how long can CNRI
keep their doors open?

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,125
Uh, depends. What time you got?

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,890
I have fiesta time.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,884
Or is it siesta time?

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,486
Which one means a party
and which one means a nap?

91
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,565
Tommy, as much as I would love to relive Intro
to Spanish with you, today is not good day.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,247
Well, of course not, working in
this tiny brick office. It's intolerable.

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,244
Now, you know where's
a spectacular place to spend the day?

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,447
Coast City.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,125
Here's what I am thinking.

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,762
Sunset flight on my private plane,
dinner at Broome's...

97
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,402
...I'll have you home by midnight.
Or maybe in the morning. Hmm?

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,248
- What is this?
- This is what we talked about.

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,482
This is you getting to know
the real me.

100
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,406
Tommy, so you don't misunderstand,
CNRI just lost its largest single donor.

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,564
Which means all of the hard work and
sacrifices that I have made to help...

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,327
...this legal clinic survive,
it may have been for nothing.

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,284
Maybe another time.

104
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,210
Yeah?

105
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,568
I mean, haven't you noticed
she's been acting a little down lately?

106
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,690
Heh, what am I saying?
Of course you haven't.

107
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,001
Oh, who are you to judge? Since when do
you pay attention to how Mom's feeling?

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,886
Since our step-father decided to take a
business trip halfway around the world.

109
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,123
I think when someone at Walter's pay
takes a trip, it's always sudden.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,327
I wouldn't worry.

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,602
Ah. Guess who I just hung up with?

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,442
Janice Bowen.

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,011
- Carter's mother.
- Oh.

114
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,207
Oh, heh.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,448
Carter Bowen. The perfect son.

116
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,521
- Is he perfect?
- According to you.

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,286
Carter Bowen just won
the national chess championship.

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,841
Carter Bowen is anchoring
the debate team.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,490
I didn't make that big a fuss.

120
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,883
Oliver, Carter just got accepted
into Harvard and Princeton.

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,321
Because Carter got a perfect score
on his SATs.

122
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,370
Now, how did he manage to study
and cure cancer?

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,568
All right, all right. I get it, I get it.

124
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,644
Well, they're coming for brunch
and I expect you to be there.

125
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,207
- I have plans.
- That's fine. Brunch is tomorrow.

126
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,682
- Heh, inches from a clean getaway.
- Well, you too, Thea.

127
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,485
- Snap.
- Nobody says that anymore.

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,450
- What? Mom?
- Hmm.

129
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,965
I can't actually go.

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,001
I haven't seen the Bowens in years.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,083
Whatever it is that you have planned...

132
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,171
...I'm sure the two of you
can make the sacrifice just this once.

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,206
We'll be there.

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,171
- I hate you.
- Mm-hm.

135
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,625
Yeah?

136
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,505
You know your friend Scott
Morgan from your father's list?

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,481
He tried to kill himself. Maybe he is
afraid of getting a visit from you.

138
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,923
- How fast can you make it to Starling General?
- On my way.

139
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,080
Hey, just the man I wanted to see.
I just picked up a new sports car.

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,562
I'm thinking, we can open her up,
pick up a few speeding tickets...

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,485
That sounds great
but something's come up. I gotta jet.

142
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,165
Oh, uh, okay.

143
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,483
Nice talk. Thanks.

144
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,605
He moves fast, doesn't he?

145
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,127
It's ironic, really, since you're
the one we call Speedy.

146
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,365
Ah, "Called," please.
For the love of God.

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,130
But if you need somebody to talk to,
I'm here.

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,443
You know, maybe you could help.

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,968
There's this girl that I'm interested in.

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,450
And I am really not sure
how to pursue it.

151
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,083
Have you tried using
your usual lines?

152
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,571
"My name is Tommy Merlyn, I'm a billionaire,
but I don't look like Warren Buffett."

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,122
Yeah, she is aware of that
and she doesn't care.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,971
You know, money really isn't
a big deal to her.

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,088
Why don't you just tell her
how you feel?

156
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,171
Well, I've...
I've known her for a long time.

157
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,290
And I'm not sure the direct approach
is the right way to go.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,125
Maybe you have to figure out
what's a big deal to her...

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,329
...and make it a big deal to you.

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,051
Thea, you are amazing, heh.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,329
Love you.

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,689
You sure?

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,043
Scott Morgan doesn't seem
like the type who'd try to kill himself.

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,409
True, but it's the best lie
I could come up with on short notice.

165
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,048
Mr. Diggle, I can't thank you enough...

166
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,722
...for arranging to move my husband
from county ward to Starling General.

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,087
Now I know he's getting
the best care available.

168
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,200
You really should be thanking this man,
Oliver Queen. He's paying the bill.

169
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,562
Jana's husband, Stan,
is a police officer.

170
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,970
He happened to have been making
a deposit at Starling Trust.

171
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,770
The bank that was robbed.

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,488
I was so sorry
to hear about your husband.

173
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,889
- Is he gonna be okay?
- The doctors say the next 24 hours are crucial.

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,771
He should have just kept
his head down, you know?

175
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,207
I've known a few police officers
in my day.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,365
Always willing to help others even
if that means putting themselves at risk.

177
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,885
Thank you.

178
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,524
You're welcome.

179
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,481
You lied to me.

180
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,405
And you asked me to work with you,
not for you.

181
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,131
And when you did, you said it was because
you understand the kind of man I am.

182
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,200
Well, Oliver, I'm the kind of man who doesn't walk
away when there's a chance to make a difference.

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,084
And neither does Stan Washington.

184
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,607
Oliver, I'm not finished talking.
Where you going?

185
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,168
To go make a difference.
Let's catch some bank robbers.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,249
See that guy there? He's got a temper.

187
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,920
- And he shot Officer Washington.
- That's right.

188
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,930
- College ring.
- Well, high school, more likely.

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,607
- That ring will get us an ID.
- But even with photo enhancement...

190
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,525
...you have a problem getting
a clear shot of that ring.

191
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,206
It left an impression
police will have photographed.

192
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,283
It'll be in evidence lockup.

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,128
Please tell me you're not going
where I think you're going.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,487
Diggle, why do you even ask?

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,526
Are you kidding me?
I don't wanna hear this.

196
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,968
Don't tell me about red tape.
One of our own's been shot.

197
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,885
Tell them to find themselves
a pair of scissors.

198
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,604
So where are you gonna take me today?
Monte Carlo?

199
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,491
Actually, uh, I was just telling Jo here...

200
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,366
...that the Merlyn Global Group is
looking to expand its local philanthropy...

201
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,884
...and I thought that we could start
by sponsoring a benefit for CNRI.

202
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,931
Thank you, Tommy. But I think we can
manage without your family's finances.

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,643
Laurel, a word?

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,723
Heh, come on.

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,081
What are you doing?

206
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,087
He's not interested
in throwing us a fundraiser.

207
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,131
What he wants to have is the First Annual
Attempt to Get Back Into My Pants Gala.

208
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,284
Who cares why he's doing it?
We need the money.

209
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,402
- Not like that, we don't.
- We really do.

210
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,166
So you're gonna listen
to your best friend's advice.

211
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,291
You are gonna go over there and say,
"Thank you, Tommy.

212
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,364
"We'd be honored
for you to throw us a fundraiser." Hmm?

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,406
Thank you, Tommy.

214
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,564
We would be honored
for you to throw us a fundraiser.

215
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,767
The bank manager Ace punched.
His ring left a mark.

216
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,325
Larchmont High.

217
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,320
High school.

218
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,802
I cross-referenced his height and relative
age with the list of students and alumni.

219
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,485
That's a pretty long list.

220
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,849
It was. I dug a little deeper
and found Kyle Reston.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,606
Right before Kyle's senior year,
not only did he drop out...

222
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,730
...he dropped off the grid,
along with his family.

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,930
Father, mother, younger brother.

224
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,606
There are two other guys involved
in this robbery.

225
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,762
And a woman.
Aside from Stan Washington...

226
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,810
...there were 22 customers and
employees that came out of the bank.

227
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,121
Nine men, 13 women.

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,802
Inside the bank, nine men, 14 women.

229
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,043
- Heh, they put a ringer in.
- The mom.

230
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,487
The police are looking for a crew,
we're gonna look for a family.

231
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,120
Speaking of which,
I'm incredibly late for mine.

232
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,971
- Well, I'm sorry Walter couldn't join us.
- Oh, yes.

233
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,010
Well, the Australian trip came up
suddenly.

234
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,605
He sends his apologies.

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,201
Where's Oliver?
He's not out of town too, is he?

236
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,169
- I'm sure he's...
- Stuck in traffic.

237
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,444
One of the things I didn't miss
on the island? Sunday drivers.

238
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,563
- Sorry I'm late.
- Mm-hm.

239
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,965
Thank God you're here.

240
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,122
It is so good to see you.

241
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,930
We all thought you were...

242
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,202
Oh, well, we are just happy he's home.

243
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,643
- Hmm, and returning as a celebrity too.
- How do you mean?

244
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,691
Well, billionaire scion,
castaway for five years.

245
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,083
You know, there is a bidding war
for the rights to your life story.

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,402
- At least, that's what my agent says.
- Agent?

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,583
I thought you were a
neurosurgeon, Carter.

248
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,066
I know. It's crazy, right?

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,000
One minute I'm publishing this book
on how long-term potentiation...

250
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,960
...initiates the creation
of a slow-moving protein synthesis...

251
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,721
...and then next, there's an agent
trying to make me the next Dr. Oz, heh.

252
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
Why would he want you
to be a wizard?

253
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,160
- Oliver.
- For our sakes, start reading US Weekly.

254
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,723
Well, the truth is, I just feel it's our
duty as Starling City's more fortunate...

255
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,360
- ...to help those most in need.
- Oh, of course.

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,047
- Do you agree, Oliver?
- You're the hero, Carter.

257
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,525
Quick and clean.
And try not to shoot anybody.

258
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,682
Now that you're back,
what are your plans?

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,321
Will you be taking a job
with Queen Consolidated?

260
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,811
I'm opening a nightclub.

261
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,567
Sir, your liquor distributor's
on the line.

262
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,206
First Bank of Starling
was hit two minutes ago.

263
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,206
Sorry.

264
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,364
Business.

265
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,410
If the rest of their M.O. holds,
they made their escape underground.

266
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,370
First Bank of Starling is located
right above water tunnels.

267
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,000
The entrance is located here.

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,282
Oliver, where are you going?

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,887
Something's come up. I'm really sorry.

270
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,287
Okay, go, go. Go.

271
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,368
I got it. Let's go.

272
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,570
S.C.P.D. Don't move!

273
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,250
Enough. What are you doing?

274
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,762
Move! Let's go!

275
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,649
Get out of here!

276
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,442
- Our cash!
- Forget it!

277
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,964
Go. Go!

278
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,805
All right, let's move.

279
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,889
It's the vigilante.

280
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,490
Come on.

281
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,444
- Who the hell was that guy?
- The local vigilante.

282
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,206
- Usually goes after rich guys.
- Clearly, he's branching out.

283
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,647
Things have gone sideways for us lately.
That hood guy showing up.

284
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
- Kyle shooting a cop.
- You are the one who warned me he was a cop.

285
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,046
- So you would take his gun, not shoot him.
- Your mother has a point.

286
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,248
Maybe this is a sign
we need to hang it up.

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,051
- Head for Mexico. Retire.
- We don't have enough.

288
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,888
We always said that we wouldn't quit
until we had enough to set ourselves up.

289
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,405
The kid's right, we need to hit another.

290
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
- We can make do with what we got.
- We'll be okay.

291
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,208
I didn't spend five years risking my life
and my freedom to just be okay.

292
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,728
No, set for life.

293
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,009
That was our deal.

294
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,730
Okay.

295
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,724
One more.

296
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,889
And then we're out.

297
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,483
I should add "personal Internet researcher
for Oliver Queen" to my job title.

298
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,967
Happily, I mean.

299
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,642
His name is Derek Reston.
We were close before I went away...

300
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,882
...and I wanna get back in touch.

301
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,161
Guess you didn't have
Facebook on that island.

302
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:48,715
Nope.

303
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,446
Not even a Myspace account.
It was a very dark time.

304
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,283
There's not much here that's recent.

305
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,644
No credit activity, no utility bills.

306
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,210
I guess you guys
must have met at the factory.

307
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,601
Wait, what factory?

308
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,527
The Queen steel factory.

309
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,561
Derek Reston worked there for 15 years
until it shut down in '07.

310
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,366
Derek Reston worked for my father?

311
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,841
You weren't really close friends, huh?

312
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,928
Looks like Derek
was the factory foreman...

313
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,606
...until your dad outsourced production
to China.

314
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,525
About 1500 employees got laid off.

315
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,684
The finance guys found a loophole
in the union contracts...

316
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,969
...so they didn't have to pay
severance packages and pensions...

317
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,451
...to their employees.

318
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,967
They all pretty much lost their homes.

319
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,641
Including your friend.

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,770
You died.

321
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,641
I asked you, I begged you to survive.

322
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,200
But if you don't think you can...

323
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,482
...there's still one bullet left.

324
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,010
But, Oliver, my death is made
meaningless by yours.

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,129
I'm starving. I'm gonna die anyway.

326
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,084
And I just want it to be quick.

327
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
I want it to be quick like yours was.

328
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,161
You can survive this.

329
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,129
No, I can't.

330
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,090
I'm not as strong as you think I am.

331
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,609
And I'm sorry.

332
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,447
The Restons just got home
after five years of being away.

333
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,921
Those factory guys hung out
at a bar after work.

334
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,855
I'm going down there.

335
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,400
Hopefully, Derek Reston wants to
take a stroll down memory lane.

336
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,602
And if by some miracle
Reston's there?

337
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,081
I'm gonna give him the
chance to do the right thing.

338
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,801
Oliver, he already had his chance to do the
right thing. It's called not being a criminal.

339
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,249
This is happening because of my father,
because of my family.

340
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,408
No. You're worried about
the wrong thing.

341
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,643
It's not your fault.
The Restons aren't the victims.

342
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
My family stole from this city.
They hurt the people in it.

343
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,001
And I am hell-bent
on making that right.

344
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,851
For Derek Reston...

345
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,010
...that means giving him the chance
to make it right.

346
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,925
Hey, don't fade on me now.

347
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,209
We have about 10,000 more decisions
to make.

348
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,762
Now, cake. Ahem, chocolate or mocha?

349
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,490
Mm, carrot.

350
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,120
Are you sure about that?
Because Bugs Bunny hasn't RSVP'd yet.

351
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,610
Tommy, why the full-court press?

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,367
Asking me to Coast City,
the fundraiser.

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,009
Why now?

354
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,808
You know, I was in a bar last week
and I was talking to this girl...

355
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,645
...and things were progressing,
if you know what I mean.

356
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,962
No, you're too subtle.

357
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,929
Anyway, we finally go back
to her place...

358
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,722
...and I realize, all of a sudden, ahem,
that I had been there before.

359
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,523
Been with her before.

360
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,202
Two years ago. I just didn't remember.

361
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,849
So I left.

362
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,444
You know...

363
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,128
...I remember...

364
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,682
...some of the mornings
when you and I were together...

365
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,320
...and I made you omelets.

366
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,329
And I'd be in your kitchen...

367
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,769
...and I would think to myself,
this isn't just fun.

368
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,926
This is more than fun. This is...

369
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,402
This is different.

370
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,723
I've never felt that way
with anybody else.

371
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,001
And I miss it.

372
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,282
Not mocha? Carrot.

373
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,608
- Carrot.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,887
- All right.
- Heh, okay, fellas.

375
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,161
Thanks for playing.

376
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,527
Mind if I sit in?

377
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,123
Oliver Queen.

378
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,931
The prodigal son returns.

379
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,924
Didn't figure you for someone
who would hang in the Glades.

380
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,320
My father used to bring me here
after we visited the factory.

381
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,906
There's a "Pac-Man"
machine in the back.

382
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,611
I had the highest score
for two months.

383
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,768
Oh, the last time I saw your dad,
he was making a speech...

384
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,211
...telling my crew not to believe
all the gossip.

385
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,767
That there was no way
Queen Consolidated...

386
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,968
...was moving production to China.

387
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,407
A week later, they closed the doors.

388
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,847
I didn't get
the two-weeks vacation pay due me.

389
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,488
My father made mistakes.

390
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,722
He hurt people.

391
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,123
When people are hurt,
people are in trouble...

392
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,965
...they tend to make
the wrong choices.

393
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,090
Right, Derek?

394
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,763
Those choices
don't have to define you.

395
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,287
They don't have to define
who your family will be.

396
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,968
Because there's always one moment
when you can turn it all around.

397
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,289
If my father had another chance...

398
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,205
...I think he'd do things differently...

399
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,485
...but time ran out for him.

400
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,449
How poetic.

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,443
That doesn't help me get
my house back, now does it?

402
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,284
No, it doesn't.

403
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,603
No, all I can offer you
is an apology and a job.

404
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,491
Queen Consolidated has subsidiaries
all over the country.

405
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,769
I make one phone call,
you start next week.

406
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,444
So, what do you say?

407
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,121
How about,
I still have some pride left?

408
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,486
Now, I don't need charity from the son
of the man who screwed me over.

409
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,649
Okay.

410
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,128
You change your mind?

411
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,610
You and I have one thing in common.

412
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,248
We're both dealing with
the consequences of my father's actions.

413
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,485
What he did then, that's on him.

414
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,244
But what we do now...

415
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,162
...that's on us.

416
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,201
I've been thinking.
Maybe you were right.

417
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,209
Maybe it's time to hang it up, retire.

418
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,091
But Kyle said
we do one more or he'll go out on his own.

419
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,881
If that's what he wants to do, that's his
right. You and me and Teddy, we're out.

420
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,726
I wanna quit too
but I am not leaving without Kyle.

421
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,690
- What's this?
- I dropped a bug in Derek Reston's jacket.

422
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,002
I thought you were gonna
give the man a second chance.

423
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,605
That's what I believe in.

424
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,842
I also believe in covering
all my bases.

425
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,762
Derek, we can't abandon our son.

426
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,287
After all this time,
he wants to end up a winner.

427
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,445
Set for life.
Otherwise, what was the point?

428
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,609
All right.

429
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,171
One more.

430
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,721
Now what?

431
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,647
We take them down.

432
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,888
Monitor the Restons with this.
You get a line on their plans, we move.

433
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,929
And you're gonna do
another abrupt exit?

434
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,730
I'm getting better at it with practice.

435
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,364
Honey, keep the alcohol flowing.

436
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,129
I ca, heh...
Wow, you look just really lovely.

437
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,645
- Lovely?
- Yeah.

438
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,922
Well, it's nice you've extended
your vocabulary...

439
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,481
...from words like
"hot" and "mega-hot."

440
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,802
You could just say "thank you,"
you know.

441
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,689
Thank you...

442
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,161
...you know.

443
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,488
You're welcome.

444
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,203
Tommy, this is wonderful.

445
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,365
- It means the world to us.
- Thank you.

446
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,688
Oh, God. Excuse me, just for a second.

447
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,925
- So?
- You were right.

448
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,731
Thank you for coming.

449
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,924
Thank you for inviting me.

450
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,210
Well, I figure the entire Queen family
and their checkbooks should be present.

451
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,243
Right. How is that going for you
so far?

452
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,449
It is going amazing
and all thanks to you.

453
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,251
You know, Thea Queen,
the unlikely voice of reason.

454
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,246
- Oh, me? Well, what did I do?
- You gave me that great advice.

455
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,325
You know, I thought about what the girl
was interested in and, uh...

456
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,210
And you did this for Laurel?

457
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,568
And it's working.

458
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,888
Thanks again, Speedy.

459
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,690
Yeah.

460
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,922
Anytime.

461
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,526
Tommy, do you remember
Carter Bowen from high school?

462
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,284
Oh, yeah, sure I do.

463
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,370
So glad you could make it.

464
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,251
So great to see you.
You look amazing.

465
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,042
I gotta say, I'm so impressed with
the work you and CNRI are doing here.

466
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,925
- Thanks, Carter.
- Yeah.

467
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,845
You know, I've actually been thinking about
starting a free clinic down here in the Glades

468
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,331
Really?

469
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,484
Maybe grab a couple drinks,
tell you what I'm thinking.

470
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,728
That sounds great.

471
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,205
It's a creative space. Gorgeous.

472
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,206
Hi.

473
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,603
Excuse me.

474
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,051
Well, I'm surprised you made it tonight,
given your hectic schedule.

475
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,322
Mom, I messed up
with the Bowens yesterday.

476
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,403
I made you a promise.

477
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,246
- I couldn't keep it.
- Well, it's nothing new for you, Oliver.

478
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,561
I know you and I
have had our difficulties...

479
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,563
...but despite all my many mistakes...

480
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,405
...I always thought that you and I
had a connection.

481
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,891
So can you imagine...

482
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,130
...just imagine,
after being granted the miracle...

483
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,409
...of having my child returned to me...

484
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,124
...that you seem to have little
or no interest in being with me.

485
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,204
Or telling me the truth.

486
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,844
Ma'am.

487
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,887
Redwood United Bank.
They're gonna try a nighttime hit.

488
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,921
I have to go.

489
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,722
- I'm sorry...
- No, don't bother apologizing.

490
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,082
Honestly, Oliver,
there are times I wonder...

491
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,447
...why you bother coming home at all.

492
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,129
- Three minutes.
- Okay.

493
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,849
You hear that?

494
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,330
- I'll check it out.
- All right.

495
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,004
Kyle Reston.

496
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
I came prepared.

497
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,444
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

498
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
- Now!
- Hey, I got this.

499
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,009
- Drop your weapons. Now!
- No!

500
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,605
He's bleeding out.

501
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,081
Call an ambulance. Now!

502
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,325
Kyle?

503
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,208
He's okay. He's just knocked out.

504
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,603
Listen, it wasn't his fault.

505
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,970
I turned my son into this.

506
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,045
I'm...

507
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,251
Of course it doesn't work.

508
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,160
I'm hallucinating. Or I'm dreaming.

509
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,129
But if you weren't...

510
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,763
You betrayed me, Oliver.

511
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,005
I died so that you could live
and you threw that gift away.

512
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,128
You made that sacrifice empty.

513
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,010
I'm not you.

514
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,886
I'm not as... I'm not strong like you.

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,286
I never was.

516
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,046
I told you,
I'm not the man you think I am.

517
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,408
The things I've done.
What I was about to do.

518
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,164
Dad.

519
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,086
What does that mean, please?

520
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,571
I don't know what it means.

521
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,730
I told you, I begged you...

522
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,882
...right my wrongs!

523
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,729
This is your responsibility now.

524
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,530
How?

525
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,881
How do I do this?

526
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,803
I can't even get off this island.

527
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,444
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the truth about me...

528
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,731
...but I hope, but I hope that
you know that I love you.

529
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,003
Did you know that as a doctor...

530
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,802
...I was able to diagnose myself
as a giant tool?

531
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,048
How about a dance, handsome?

532
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,283
Hey, uh, I thought that we agreed
that you were going to call me...

533
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,761
...before you did something stupid.

534
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,241
See? You're no fun.

535
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,006
I'm gonna show you
how to have some fun.

536
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

537
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,482
You said I was amazing.

538
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,770
You are amazing, but you're also
like my sister. My baby sister.

539
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,366
Well, I'm not a baby anymore.

540
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,200
Thank you for noticing.

541
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,131
Heh, Laurel doesn't even like you.

542
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,847
She doesn't understand you.

543
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,530
I do.

544
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,409
- Why can't you just see that?
- Thea.

545
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,010
Thea, it was a mistake to talk to you
about girls and stuff.

546
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,970
It was inappropriate
and I think it may have confused you.

547
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,885
Heh, no, the rejection is pretty clear.

548
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,443
Even if it wasn't,
between my mom and Oliver...

549
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,441
...and, heh, everybody in my entire life,
I'm pretty much used to it by now, so...

550
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,165
Whoa, whoa.

551
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,125
Hey, let's go, let's go. Come on.
It's all right.

552
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,967
- Tommy?
- Yeah.

553
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,286
Is Thea okay?

554
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,205
Oh, yeah. She just ate
some bad crab cakes.

555
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,006
Are you sure
it wasn't something she drank?

556
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,889
Ahem, don't worry. I got this.

557
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,003
You can go back inside.
Keep having fun.

558
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,403
Looked like you were having a nice
little do-si-do with the good doctor.

559
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,168
Tommt, I'm gonna let you in on a
little-known secret about Dr. Carter Bowen.

560
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,243
The man is a gigantic ass.

561
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,329
And the only reason
why I danced with him...

562
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,643
...is because he wrote
a massive check to CNRI.

563
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,451
Why would you think anything else?

564
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,129
I guess when it comes to you,
I tend not to think straight.

565
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,563
Can you call me a cab?

566
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,805
Absolutely not. I am taking you home.
Get in.

567
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,607
I apologize for making such a scene.

568
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,251
Just feel better, okay?

569
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,081
Hey, Tommy. I owe you a dance.

570
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,401
Yeah?

571
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,369
You earned it.

572
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,769
Good night.

573
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,647
- Please don't hate me.
- Never.

574
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,770
Never.

575
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,482
- What went down wasn't your fault.
- I didn't say it was.

576
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,003
Oliver, it wasn't your fault, man.

577
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,445
You gave Reston a chance.
That was more than he deserved.

578
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,881
I'm not so sure about that.

579
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,641
Well, listen, I'll tell you this much.

580
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,371
You say going after the guys on that list
is the way you honored your dad?

581
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,687
Well, if your dad could have seen you
this week...

582
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,245
...the way you cared
about the people he had hurt...

583
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,687
...the way you stepped up
to try to help them...

584
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,846
...I say he'd be pretty damn honored.

585
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,530
So maybe there is more than one way
to save this city.

586
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,204
Maybe.

587
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,284
By the way, Stan Washington woke up.

588
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,048
He's gonna be fine.

589
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,006
My responsibility.

590
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,408
I promise, Dad.

591
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,965
I promise.

592
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,929
Nightcap?

593
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,363
Well, I thought it would help me.
I don't sleep well alone.

594
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,171
I'm sorry about what I said tonight.

595
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,804
No.

596
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,406
You were being honest.

597
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,528
No, not entirely.

598
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,481
The truth is, with Walter being gone,
I'm...

599
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,003
I'm lonely.

600
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,960
You know, you and I used to talk.
I used to know what you were thinking.

601
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,244
But now, even when you're home,
you're somewhere else.

602
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,369
I guess I just miss my son.

603
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,205
I miss you too.

604
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,481
And I wish that...

605
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,731
Are you hungry?

606
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,764
Thank you.

607
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,441
All right.

608
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,410
Mm, Mom, heh.

609
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,450
It's okay to get your hands dirty
every once in a while. For me, please.

610
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,884
All right.

611
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,771
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

612
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,127
- Mm.
- Yeah.

613
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
That is a great burger.

614
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,088
- Thank you for this.
- Anytime.

615
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,569
I'll bet Carter Bowen doesn't know where to
find the best burger joint in Starling City.

616
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,646
So I have one thing on him?

617
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,765
No.

618
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,804
You have everything on him, Oliver.
