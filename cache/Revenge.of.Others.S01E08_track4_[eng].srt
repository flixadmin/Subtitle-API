1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,252
-Really?
-Yeah, your bangs are burnt.

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,920
-What?
-I was so surprised, really.

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,839
Seriously, come on.

4
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,507
Oh. Gi Osung?

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,633
Oh, hey, Osung.

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,260
Did you come here looking for me again?

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,344
Yeah.

8
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,096
By any chance are you guys
celebrating Ok Chanmi's birthday?

9
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,222
I guess you already ran into her?

10
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,515
It seemed like she was on her way
to wash her face

11
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,517
after getting a cake smash.

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,436
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,146
Yeah, you should join us.

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,107
It's fine. I wasn't even invited anyway.

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,192
Jaebum, I'll wait for you
in the café out front.

16
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,652
Okay, then.

17
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,621
FATHER

18
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,457
I'm going to head out.

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,958
See you.

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,711
Yes, father.

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,885
It was Gi Osung?

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,180
Are you saying it was Gi Osung's ringtone?

23
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,558
Yeah, Gi Osung came in after you left.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,060
Then I heard his ringtone.

25
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,773
It's not a common ringtone.

26
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,524
And he was close to Park Wonseok.

27
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,610
That's why I think the person
who called you...

28
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,613
...was Gi Osung.

29
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,617
Gi Osung. I'm going to kill him.

30
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,747
-Don't even think about shooting him.
-Why not?

31
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,540
You punished all those bad guys yourself,

32
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,958
and now you're telling me
to leave this murderer alone?

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,668
I'm not saying you shouldn't take action.

34
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,338
All I'm saying is that you should think
about how it will impact your life!

35
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,965
I don't care. I'm going to kill them all.

36
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,926
Mind your own business!

37
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,638
Chanmi.

38
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,972
I understand.

39
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,643
Let's calm down for now.

40
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,730
Promise me you won't pursue this alone.

41
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,819
Promise me.

42
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,904
Don't go after Gi Osung alone.

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,492
Fine.

44
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,893
Jaebum, why don't you go back home today?

45
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,354
Your mother's worried about you.

46
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,525
What's keeping you from going back home?

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,655
You haven't been back since I gave you
that photo of you and Park Wonseok.

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,493
The photos have nothing to do with it.

49
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,745
Really?

50
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,915
I'm just scared to be home.

51
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,751
What do you mean?

52
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,379
When I'm alone at home,
crazy ideas pop into my head.

53
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,844
What I'm trying to say is that
I start having these crazy delusions.

54
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,097
I get the feeling
that I did something that I didn't do.

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,100
And for things that I did do,
I have no memory of them.

56
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,856
I think I'm going crazy, seriously.
I'm really scared.

57
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,609
Jaebum?

58
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,611
It's driving me crazy!

59
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,031
I can't come out of these crazy delusions.

60
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,949
Jaebum.

61
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,618
Calm down. Just calm down.

62
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,078
Do think you're going crazy right now?

63
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,415
You jumped from a building

64
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,627
and hurt your head. You lost memories,
and you're just recovering is all.

65
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,670
That's why you're feeling so confused.

66
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,801
Fuck, how can you be so sure?

67
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,471
What?

68
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,099
I'm asking you how you can be so sure.

69
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,937
You seem to know everything
that's going on right now.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,063
You know what I've done

71
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,315
and you know what's going on
inside my head, huh?

72
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,524
Jaebum, I'm... it's not...

73
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,361
Are you trying to manipulate me
by showing me a picture of Park Wonseok,

74
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,738
knowing it would embarrass me
that I dated him?

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,908
And you're trying to use that against me?

76
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,993
No, damn it,
what are you even talking about?

77
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,662
Why on earth would I manipulate you?

78
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,499
You manipulated Park Wonseok too.

79
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,918
That's not the same.

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,087
How is that any different, you bastard?

81
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,423
What were you going to do
by exploiting my weakness? Huh?

82
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,385
Were you going to kill me too
if I didn't listen to you?

83
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,428
Damn, you're totally
out of your mind, seriously!

84
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,315
Osung.

85
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,026
Osung.

86
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,489
Was I really in a relationship
with Park Wonseok?

87
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,993
Is it true?

88
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,205
Hah, shit!

89
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,394
Ajung, are you hungry?
Want to have some dumplings?

90
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,230
-Should I go get something for you?
-I'm okay. Don't try so hard to look calm.

91
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,442
-I know you're feeling shitty right now.
-Stop giving me shit.

92
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,236
Hey.

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,531
Did you know Sooheon and Chanmi
were living together?

94
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,284
They're not actually living together.

95
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,287
-They're just living in the same building.
-I'm asking if you knew that already.

96
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,126
I knew.

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,253
You idiot.

98
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,380
You shouldn't have let them live
in the same building!

99
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,966
Who am I to tell them not to live
in the same building?

100
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,304
Judging by the vibe between those two,

101
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,097
it seems like they're already in love
with each other.

102
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,391
Hey, shut up.

103
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,062
Why are things so messed up?

104
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,564
The wrong person was shot by cupid's arrow

105
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,608
and now Ji Sooheon's a suspect.

106
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,069
But even still...

107
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,946
I think we made the right decision
to celebrate her birthday.

108
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,656
Chanmi seemed happy.

109
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,036
It was my first time seeing her smile.

110
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,087
You didn't have to follow me up here.

111
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,302
Thank you

112
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,638
for today.

113
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,599
No problem.

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,604
About Gi Osung,

115
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,192
you're not going to report him
to the police, are you?

116
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
No.

117
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,489
These are the same cops that didn't
even carry out a proper investigation

118
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,574
and just concluded
that my brother was a suicide.

119
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,784
How can I trust them?

120
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,953
Also, his father's a police chief.

121
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,039
Oh, while we're on the topic,

122
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,209
let's start by confirming

123
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,545
if the ringtone we heard on that call
is actually the same

124
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,213
as the one on Gi Osung's cell phone.

125
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,840
How could we be any more certain about it?

126
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,509
How could it possibly be a coincidence
that Gi Osung's ringtone

127
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,136
is the same as the one on that call?

128
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
That's why we should double check.

129
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,765
If we're half-baked about this,
we might not catch the killer.

130
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,934
What did you have in mind?

131
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,855
If we can match the time
that you heard the ringtone

132
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,566
with an incoming call on Gi Osung's phone,

133
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,526
then he's the killer.

134
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,195
There's probably a call log on his phone.

135
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,449
So are you saying we should get a hold
of his phone and unlock it?

136
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,075
That's the hard part.

137
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,954
Right after I transferred to this school,
my cell phone was stolen.

138
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,082
Someone hit me over the head with a brick
so that I would lose consciousness

139
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,417
and used my fingerprint
to unlock my phone.

140
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,797
So are you saying we should hit him
over the head with a brick as well?

141
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,174
Why not?

142
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,051
Gosh.

143
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,097
Yeah. Let's give it some more thought.

144
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,392
Anyways, rest up for now.
I'm heading back downstairs.

145
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,685
Okay.

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,022
Ah, I almost forgot!

147
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,106
Sorry.

148
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,901
I wasn't able to prepare a birthday gift.

149
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,278
No worries.

150
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,946
There's no way you would've known
it was my birthday.

151
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,156
Still...

152
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,992
is there anything in particular
you'd like as a gift?

153
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,745
I told you it's fine.

154
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,747
I mean, but...

155
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,290
I still...

156
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,417
would like to...

157
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,836
get you something.

158
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,300
In any case, I'll think about it.
Sleep well.

159
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,801
Night.

160
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,389
Hey, Sooheon.

161
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,226
Then how about...

162
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,312
those shoelaces on your tennis shoes.

163
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,651
The shoelaces?

164
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,735
Yeah.

165
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,904
What're you going to do with these?
They're pretty old.

166
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,991
Nothing, really. I just thought
it was the finest thing you owned.

167
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,576
Hah, come on!

168
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,703
Are you making fun of me?

169
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,580
I own expensive things too.

170
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,666
-No, you don't.
-Right, I don't.

171
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,754
You don't have to give them to me.
Who would want used shoelaces?

172
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,922
I was just joking.

173
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,465
See you tomorrow.

174
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,536
Tada.

175
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,955
Huh? What's this?

176
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,416
What's with these red shoelaces?

177
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,585
Mom, don't you recognize these?

178
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,879
Aren't these the shoelaces
from my tennis shoes?

179
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
That's right.

180
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,216
I took them from your shoes.

181
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,344
Sooheon.

182
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,016
Why would a boy put red shoelaces
on a pair of white sneakers?

183
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,977
Since you can't walk with them on,

184
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm going to do the walking for you.

185
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,691
I can't wear your old sneakers
because they're too small for my feet,

186
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,818
so I just tied my shoes
with your shoelaces.

187
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:22,163
I'll walk a lot praying
you'll get better soon.

188
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,707
Okay, then.

189
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,586
What do you think? Aren't they nice?

190
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,576

This is where we found the receipt.

193
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,213
YONGTAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

194
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,007
This is the receipt.

195
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,218
It was left over on the floor
of the body shop.

196
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,012
The torn part of the receipt
was not found at the scene.

197
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,349
The reason why I'm emphasizing
the importance of this receipt

198
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,268
is because it's likely
that it belonged to the suspect.

199
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,521
Isn't it possible that it belonged
to one of the customers

200
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,856
at the body shop rather than the suspect?

INSIDE THE BODY SHOP AFTER THE INCIDENT

204

Here, the receipt is there
at the scene of the crime.

205
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,337
But here you will see that it wasn't there
before the suspect arrived.

206
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,799
Ah, also, it seems this barcode isn't

207
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,428
something you might find
on just another restaurant receipt.

208
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,762
Rather, it's a kind of barcode
that certain businesses

209
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,557
might use for their own intents
and purposes.

210
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,017
Which leads me to believe
this is part of a membership ID.

211
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,563
Oh, yeah. This barcode is commonly used
in gyms or other places like that.

212
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,522
Yes, sir.

213
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,400
That's why I'm planning to check
the shopping malls in the area first.

214
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,278
That's going to be good evidence.
Make sure you search thoroughly.

215
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,363
You haven't made any progress at all!

216
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,006
Huh? I was just about to feed Thor.

217
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,340
I guess we'll have to watch out.

218
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,259
Thor will probably pretend
he hasn't eaten just so he can eat twice.

219
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,303
Wow, you fat cat.

220
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,221
Maybe we should decide
who'll feed him on which day.

221
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,776
Um?

222
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,865
What? Are you really giving these to me?

223
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,700
Didn't you ask for them?

224
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,246
Thanks.

225
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,460
Hold on.

226
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,848
Did you really have
to change your shoelaces?

227
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,308
Why wouldn't I?

228
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,894
What else would I do with shoelaces
other than put them on shoes?

229
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,271
It seems like
something's been bothering you.

230
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,067
It makes me feel
like you're wearing my clothes.

231
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,027
What? It's like that now?

232
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,363
Just don't throw them away.

233
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,200
If you feel like throwing them away,
just return them to me.

234
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,410
Do these have
some sort of special meaning for you?

235
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,745
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you
to give them to me.

236
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,414
Nah, it's nothing.

237
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,168
Anyways, go wherever you want
in those shoes.

238
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,461
Go visit awesome places.

239
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,505
And visit some fun places too.

240
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,840
What do you mean?

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,009
Nakjun!

242
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,678
Hey, Sooheon!

243
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,596
Hurry up, dude.

244
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,973
I'm surprised you're going to school
on time today.

245
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,891
Hey, hey. When was I ever late? Damn.

246
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,643
It's good to see you.

247
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,327
Nothing?

248
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,037
Nope, nothing.

249
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,873
All right, let's head
to the next building then.

250
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,332
Cheer up.

251
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,710
The way I see this
is that I'm getting paid for working out.

252
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,295
-Let's go.
-Okay.

253
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,298
It's this one here.

254
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
Hmm.

255
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,636
On our receipt,
we have the barcode in the center.

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,013
-You're right.
-Thank you.

257
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,097
Of course.

258
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,060
Hm, hold on one moment.

259
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,480
I think it actually looks
a lot like our membership pass.

260
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,690
Excuse me?

261
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,819
Here, if you take a look at this...

262
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,323
Ah, this looks the same.

263
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,159
Sir, could you please check
when this receipt was issued?

264
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,954
Since only the front part was lost,
most of the information is intact.

265
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,373
The torn-off part just has information
about our store.

266
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,751
But this back part has all the information
about the date, time,

267
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,502
and, well...
all of that information comes up.

268
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,463
Oh, really?
Could you please check it for me?

269
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,089
Yes, sir. Since the torn-off part
is identical on each receipt,

270
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,591
I can just fill in the rest
and give it a try, yeah?

271
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,551
-Yes, please. Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,934
WITH ME REAL ESTATE

273
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:35,893
Nothing?

274
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,936
Nope. Nothing.

275
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,396
Wow, did I just set us up for failure?

276
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,190
I think you'll be proven right.

277
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,025
Why don't we keep going
for a little bit longer?

278
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,985
Oh, I can really count on you, huh?

279
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
Cool, let's go!

280
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
You can trust me, Sooheon.

281
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,584
I know, I know.

282
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,630
I trust that you didn't kill Ju Hyeokgeon,
that bastard.

283
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,468
If I hadn't run into him at the OBGYN,
this wouldn't have happened.

284
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,223
I'm not blaming you though, Sooheon.

285
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,184
I totally agree that bastards like that
should get their asses kicked.

286
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,268
The reason we asked to see you
is because...

287
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,982
If the cops were looking for you
while you were gone,

288
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,693
it means they must know something.

289
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,070
That's why I thought
we should share what we know,

290
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,947
so that we can coordinate our stories.

291
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,615
The cops stormed into the gym

292
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,368
to find evidence.

293
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,706
I had a backpack
where I kept all the tools I used

294
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,541
when I smashed those guys.

295
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,167
So?

296
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,378
Chanmi

297
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,964
had snatched the backpack in time.

298
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,010
If it weren't for her,
I would've already been arrested.

299
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,636
Had I been caught,

300
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,556
I could've been framed as a murderer.

301
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,183
Chanmi is awesome, seriously.

302
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,353
In that case, we should probably
include Chanmi in this

303
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,605
so that we can all share information.

304
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,110
Anyways, let's just be careful.

305
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,194
By the way.

306
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,239
Who do you think was responsible
for cutting her brake

307
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,407
and breaking the windows?

308
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,285
Who would've gone into her room
to break her things

309
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,911
and rip up her school uniform?

310
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,331
Isn't Kook Jihyun pretty eager
to destroy Ok Chanmi these days?

311
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,751
Also, Kook Jihyun has bullies for friends.

312
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,670
You know they beat me up once too.

313
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,424
I'm suspicious of Gi Osung.

314
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,009
Why would Gi Osung do that to Chanmi?

315
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,345
Well, they are siblings after all.

316
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,057
If it was Gi Osung who did it,

317
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,516
don't you think he would've taken a photo
with his cell phone?

318
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,518
If he did it, he probably would've.

319
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,187
So that he could show it to Kook Jihyun.

320
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,354
Why don't we...

321
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,274
check Gi Osung's phone?

322
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,922
You son of a bitch,
do you have a death wish?

323
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,009
Have you lost your mind? Hey!

324
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,095
-What?
-Ugh, shit.

325
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,387
What was that?

326
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,806
I said, what was that?

327
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,975
What, I know you've been talking trash
about me, you son of a bitch!

328
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,895
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh?! Huh?!

329
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,857
You. Go. Just leave. Fuck off. Shit.

330
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,818
-Who do you think you are?
-Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,986
You crazy bastard.

332
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,822
Damn bitch, what the hell?

333
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,906
Let me go!

334
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,241
Hey, hey, hey, let me go!
I said let me go! Shit!

335
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,575
You, I told you to leave me alone, shit!
You're dead today!

336
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,660
-Calm down, calm down, okay?
-You, come over here.

337
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,036
This crazy bitch wants to die today.

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,871
-Fine, it's just...
-Hold on. Hey, let me go for a second.

339
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,332
When did I ever have sex with you,
you motherfucker! Huh?

340
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,543
What the fuck?
Why would I ever sleep with you?

341
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,753
-You bastard. Go fuck yourself!
-Let go!

342
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,046
-You, come here!
-Stop with that bullshit.

343
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,673
-I'm going to kill you.
-You motherfucker!

344
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,466
Hey, Sooheon, Sooheon,
it looks like a fight just broke out.

345
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,009
Do you want to go check it out?

346
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,177
-Hey, Soyeon, calm down.
-Osung, she's a girl.

347
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,096
-Ah.
-Uh...

348
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,222
You should go watch.

349
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,141
No, it's fine. Those pathetic fools.

350
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,560
Aren't they too old to fight like that?

351
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,645
-Hey, Nakjun.
-Yeah?

352
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,147
You seem interested in the fight.
You should go.

353
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,857
Nah, come on. I'm not curious.

354
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,901
Hey, Ajung, who's fighting
who in your class right now?

355
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,986
Gi Osung and Tae Soyeon.

356
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,779
Huh? Why? Hold on.

357
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,698
See? Answer the question, bitch.

358
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,242
Why don't you start
talking like you did earlier?

359
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,994
Hey, calm down, calm down.

360
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,999
Why don't you just hit me?

361
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,847
When the suspect
called my phone, it was...

362
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,764
The 8th...

363
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,100
...8:17 p.m.
on the night of the 8th.

364
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,852
CLASS 4 KANG YOUNGHOON
JAEBUM HYUNG'S MOTHER

365
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,439
He got a new cell phone.

366
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,107
There's no call log.

367
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,277
FIND MY PHONE YOUR CELLPHONE SIGNAL
WAS FOUND WITHIN 100M FROM YOU

368
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,281
You dared to steal my phone
when I just lost one 4 days ago?

369
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,616
GI OSUNG

370
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,284
You're fucking dead.

371
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,411
KOOK JIHYUN

372
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
MEN'S RESTROOM

373
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,810
GI OSUNG

374
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,079
CALL MISSED

375
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,124
Ah, fuck. Filthy thief.

376
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,629
He put my phone in the toilet and ran off.

377
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,639
Fucking thief!

378
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,809
When I find you,
I'm going to tear you apart.

379
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
PLEASE WASH THE MOP
THOROUGHLY AFTER USE.

380
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,236
The places
include South and North Korea...

381
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,240
...and the Indian Ocean,
which is a neutral space,

382
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,742
where the protagonist goes.

383
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,868
It's from an omniscient
writer's point of view.

384
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,124
...this topic is ideological conflict
and the way...

385
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,214
Gi Osung got a new phone?

386
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,217
Seems like he did 4 days ago.

387
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,179
It was brand new, and there was
no call history before 5 days ago.

388
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,181
Why would he replace it?

389
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,516
He said he got a new one
because he lost it.

390
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,977
But the timing
is what makes it suspicious.

391
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,438
He probably tried to hide the evidence.

392
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,857
Do you think it's possible
that he might've started to notice

393
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,401
and got rid of my brother's phone
and the rest of the evidence?

394
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,990
GI WANGDO

395
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,054
Sergeant Hyun.

396
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,306
-What brings you here?
-Oh, yes, Chief.

397
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,809
-Hello.
-Hello.

398
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,018
Oh, these are my kids.

399
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,269
Hi.

400
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
Welcome.

401
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,856
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

402
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,566
I'll bring you a cup of coffee
in the reading room.

403
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,609
So...

404
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,945
What is it? Let's go in. Yeah.

405
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,367
Mom.

406
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,662
I've seen that investigator at school.

407
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,705
Do you think he's here
because of the incident at school?

408
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,207
He probably didn't come
for the investigation.

409
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,583
It must be a personal matter.

410
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,139
Gwon Sejin?

411
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,531
Um...

412
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,532
Thank you.

413
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:53,950
But...

414
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,952
are you sure?

415
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,208
Are you sure Ji Sooheon
isn't the one who killed Wonseok?

416
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,417
It's not him.

417
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,628
Ji Sooheon's not the murderer.

418
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,923
The real culprit is someone else,
I'm sure.

419
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,467
Ah, I'm hundred percent sure
I saw the suspect running away.

420
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,344
The murderer was wearing a pair
of white sneakers with red shoelaces.

421
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,887
White sneakers with red shoelaces.

422
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,224
I don't recall anyone else wearing
those shoes other than Ji Sooheon...

423
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,644
Then are you saying the suspect
is pretending to be like Ji Sooheon?

424
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,187
Why me...

425
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,813
So you're saying it's someone else?

426
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,856
Who is it?

427
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,493
Well, I guess you guys
don't know yet either.

428
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,872
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

429
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,334
Sorry I suspected you.

430
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,418
It's okay.

431
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,921
It's all good.

432
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,716
Chanmi, I'm sorry.

433
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,303
I'm sorry for breaking your windows...

434
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,516
...breaking the things inside the room,
and ripping up your uniform.

435
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,642
What?

436
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,353
Were you... were you the one who did that?

437
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,190
I mean, after I told you that Ji Sooheon
was the suspect,

438
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,859
nothing came of it after that.

439
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,614
So I came here,
wondering why, only to see that

440
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,742
you were living with Ji Sooheon.

441
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,038
That's when I felt totally betrayed,
and I couldn't forgive you for it.

442
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,042
I'll be going over to the United States
this weekend.

443
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,421
Since I didn't have much time left,

444
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,674
I couldn't bear to leave
without taking care of Ji Sooheon first.

445
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,260
So that's why
it all went down like this today.

446
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,845
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,431
You must have been really angry then, huh?

448
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,560
I almost died in the scooter accident.

449
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,061
A scooter accident?

450
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,648
What?

451
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,692
Aren't you the one who

452
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,194
cut the brake on my scooter?

453
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,157
What? What are you talking about?
That wasn't me.

454
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,959
So, what brings you here
at this time of night?

455
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,670
Um, Chief...

456
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,507
It's about what we talked about
in the briefing,

457
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,092
about the murder case at the body shop.

458
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,844
What? You're here to talk about the case?

459
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,431
I thought it was about something personal.

460
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,600
Hey, I thought you were about to tell me
you're getting married or something.

461
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,478
So what's up?

462
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,104
-Tell me.
-It's...

463
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,609
about the receipt with the barcode.

464
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,610
Yeah, what about it?

465
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,447
It was torn off from a receipt
that was used

466
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,782
as an entrance pass to a study café.

467
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,743
It was a reading room years ago,
but now it's a study cafe...

468
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,827
Yeah, yeah I know it.

469
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,872
Osung and Jihyun go there sometimes.

470
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
Ah, I see!

471
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,127
So the receipt is part of an entrance pass
to the study café?

472
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,008
If you check the barcode,
you'll know who used the pass.

473
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,428
If you check
the surveillance footage there...

474
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,098
we can see for certain who it is.

475
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,787
Hey, Jongguk, what's going on?

476
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,582
Who was it?

477
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,504
It's Gi Osung.

478
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,591
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

479
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,301
Hey...

480
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,762
Hey, hey, tell me. Who was it, really?

481
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,147
Jongguk.

482
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,315
Jongguk, hey.

483
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,277
Are you sure it was Osung?

484
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,405
Yes.

485
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,116
It actually is

486
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,118
your son's receipt.

487
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,583
That doesn't necessarily mean...

488
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:16,796
Osung was at the murder scene, does it?
It's not direct evidence, is it?

489
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,965
No, sir.

490
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,260
So what we need to figure out is...

491
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,180
why Osung's receipt was

492
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,056
at the crime scene?

493
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,017
Yes, Chief.

494
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,560
Are you...

495
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,354
Are you the only one

496
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,026
who knows it was Osung's receipt?

497
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,280
I've yet to report
this to detective Jin Sojung.

498
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,241
Is there some reason why you haven't?

499
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,164
I thought I should report
to you first, Chief.

500
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,210
And wait to follow your order.

501
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,419
Good.

502
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,219

504
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,017
Huh?

505
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,852
The rich guy is on the bus.

506
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,355
Hey, Seok Jaebum.

507
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,356
Oh?

508
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,316
So you guys take this one too?

509
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,652
Jaebum, I thought you always
came to school in a Rolls Royce.

510
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,111
I'm going to be taking the bus
from now on.

511
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,031
Jaebum, are you trying out
the life of a commoner?

512
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,825
Nope.

513
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,910
I just prefer a bigger vehicle.

514
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,252
Are you done fraternizing with him?

515
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,546
What? Jaebum and I
are from the same middle school.

516
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,755
Cheongwoo Middle School.

517
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,258
A seat just opened up. Go sit.

518
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,301
Did you even know each other
in middle school?

519
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,847
He's the grandson of a corporate mogul.
Everyone knew him.

520
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,390
I knew about Ajung as well.

521
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,850
She's a greater dancer
and good at singing too.

522
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,644
Even a third-generation corporate mogul
knows who I am.

523
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,818
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

524
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,153
I've finished
checking Gi Osung's cell phone location.

525
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,574
He wasn't near the scene of the crime

526
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. the next day.

527
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,537
Is that right?

528
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,998
According to the log,
he was near the study café at the time.

529
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,209
Oh, I see, he was studying.

530
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,923
But according to the entrance log
at the study café...

531
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,468
There was no record of him
entering the café after 6 o'clock.

532
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,054
So then...

533
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,141
Ah, so what are you saying happened?

534
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,647
Do you mean he left his cellphone
in the study café and then left?

535
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,861
Uh, I mean...

536
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,241
I'll ask Osung about this directly.

537
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,037
Jongguk, so, um...
can you keep this information to yourself

538
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,038
for just one more day?

539
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,248
I'll follow your orders, Chief, but...

540
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,251
it seems like the victim in the case,

541
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,420
Ju Hyeokgeon graduated
from the same middle school as Gi Osung.

542
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,298
Gi Osung is a year older.

543
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,426
When Ju Hyeokgeon committed the murder
as a juvenile delinquent,

544
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,305
Gi Osung was attending
the same middle school.

545
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,896
After I leave work today,

546
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,317
I'll get the truth out of my son.

547
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,449
So please keep these records to yourself
until tomorrow, understood?

548
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,785
Yes, Chief.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

552
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,740
What's up?

553
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,118
You know how I wasn't able
to take the practice exam

554
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,577
because I've been ditching class?

555
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,705
I'm worried about you.
What's going on with you?

556
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,833
I know you're pretty busy,
but can I ask you for a favor?

557
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,752
Could you tutor me?

558
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,962
A private lesson?

559
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,130
Oh...

560
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,051
Sure, where should we study?

561
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,721
Well, wherever's most convenient
for you...

562
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,389
A study café?

563
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,436
All my materials are at home, so...

564
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,895
Why don't you come to my house?

565
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,523
Would that be okay?

566
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,442
Well, I don't see why not.
We'll just be studying.

567
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,485
Let's head to my house together
once class is over.

568
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,407
Jihyun, thank you.

569
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,992
Psh, you're welcome.

570
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,253
Chanmi.

571
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,839
Hey.

572
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,889
-Jaebum.
-Yeah?

573
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,891
Can I ask you for a favor?

574
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,768
Yeah, what is it?

575
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,771
I have something to talk
to Gi Osung about.

576
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,190
Could you be there with me
when I talk to him?

577
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,983
You want me to be there
when you're talking to him?

578
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,026
Yeah.

579
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,404
I fought with Kook Jihyun once,

580
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,990
Gi Osung fought with Tae Soyeon.

581
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,117
And I don't want things
to be like this forever.

582
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,163
That's why I thought I should apologize
and try to reconcile with him.

583
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,167
But I felt it might be awkward
if I asked him myself.

584
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,418
Okay.

585
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,462
I'll ask Osung about it.

586
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,839
Oh, so, when?

587
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,299
After school today.

588
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,509
Today?

589
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,596
I don't think
I'll have any free time otherwise.

590
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,350
Please, I'd really appreciate it.

591
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,645
Okay, I'll arrange for him to meet you.

592
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,523
Thank you, thank you so much.

593
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:22,703
HYUN JONGGUK, SERGEANT,
INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

594
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,205
Hello, this is the Special Victims Unit
at the Yongtan Police Department.

595
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,375
Yeah, can I talk
to Detective Hyun Jongguk?

596
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,752
He's currently out of office.
How can I help you?

597
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,003
I wanted to ask some questions

598
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,297
about what he's going to do
with the surveillance footage.

599
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,049
What footage?

600
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,177
You know, Detective Hyun checked it
when he stopped by my shop yesterday.

601
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,555
I'm calling from the study café
where the torn receipt was from.

602
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,099
I see, yes, yes.

603
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,643
So, what are you going to do
with the recordings?

604
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,146
If I reactivate the surveillance camera,
the old recordings will be gone.

605
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,398
In fact, I'm currently operating my store
without the cameras on.

606
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,942
Please don't...
don't activate it just yet.

607
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,610
I'll be right there.

608
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,903
What is the address there?

609
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,906
This.

610
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,825
Yeah. That's right. The entrance pass.

611
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,536
It looks just like what the male detective
showed me yesterday

612
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,877
So where is the recording?

613
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,046
Ugh, here. Here it is.

614
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,258
You guys are going about this
really inefficiently.

615
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,509
Oh, sir.

616
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,304
Can you zoom in a bit?

617
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,305
Sure, sure.

618
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,764
Here.

The Chief's son?

622
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,783
Tell me whatever you want to have today.
I'll prepare it for you.

623
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,828
Why don't we have some kalguksu today?

624
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,748
With some clams and zucchini?

625
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,042
-And some fresh kimchi to top it off.
-What the...

626
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,679
Excuse me.

627
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,766
You recognize me, right?

628
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,269
I'm Min Seonha's dad.

629
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,856
I thought you were a college student,

630
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,983
but it seems you're actually
just one year older than Seonha.

631
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,207
Mr. Min.

632
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,878
Why don't we talk inside?

633
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,137
Seems like
I'm having a bad makeup day.

634
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,389
It's fine, just stop.

635
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,515
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

636
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,894
I never imagined that I'd ever go
to an OBGYN with you.

637
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,938
And you think I would've seen this coming?

638
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,365
Do you know him?

639
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,701
No.

640
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,253
So...

641
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,131
that's when I found out you live here.

642
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,925
The reason why I came here today is...

643
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,555
It's okay. You can keep talking.

644
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,725
My friend knows about what happened.

645
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,644
Thanks to you...

646
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,814
Seonha was doing just fine,

647
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:43,154
until that bastard Sa Junggyeong
showed up again.

648
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,740
Sa Junggyeong...

649
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,742
I'll get to the point.

650
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,369
I guess I'm asking you
to take care of him again.

651
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,788
This time, please make sure

652
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:57,918
he won't ever dare to appear
before Seonha, ever again.

653
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,921
Please tell that person...

654
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,965
that I need his help.

655
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,936
That place was pretty good.
Let's go there again sometime.

656
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,563
Oh, I didn't think it was good,
to be honest.

657
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,443
Oh, Detective Jin.

658
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,446
You look tired.
Why don't you head home early today?

659
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,245
You crazy bastard.

660
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,622
Are you even human?

661
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,165
Detective Jin, why are you doing this?

662
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,792
Detective Jin,
what are you doing right now?

663
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,251
Why am I doing this?

664
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,004
You call yourself a cop, you bastard?

665
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,092
How could you go straight
to the Chief's office with that evidence?

666
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,928
You filthy bastard.

667
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,305
How dare you stand there
like you've done nothing wrong?

668
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,556
You son of a bitch!

669
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,142
How could you do this to me?

670
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,520
You bastard!

671
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,939
Get lost, you bastard, let me go!

672
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,325
Why isn't Ok Chanmi coming?

673
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,285
Jaebum, why don't you give her a call?

674
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,413
You know I did just a few minutes ago.

675
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,206
She said she's on her way,
so let's just wait a little longer.

676
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,918
She's the one who asked to meet.
She should have come before me.

677
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,855
This is my house.

678
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,815
It's nice.

679
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,692
You've never been
to this side of the town, have you?

680
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,571
Are you there?

681
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,572
OK CHANMMI
ARE YOU THERE?

682
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,573
Yes.

683
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,160
Come in.

684
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,453
Are you uncomfortable at all?

685
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,246
No, not at all.

686
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,456
No one's home.

687
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,623
Wouldn't that be more comfortable?

688
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,417
Yeah, for sure.

689
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,646
Where should we study?

690
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,273
My room is on the second floor.

691
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,108
But I guess the kitchen table
would be better?

692
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
Oh, yeah. I think so, too.

693
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,491
So where's Gi Osung's room?

694
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,825
Over there.

695
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,162
I'm just going to change
into something more comfortable.

696
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,246
Oh, okay.

697
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,906
Hey, Sooheon.

698
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,367
Should we start studying?

699
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,160
Ah, I'm really sorry,

700
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,705
but can we have some ramen
before we start studying?

701
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,206
Oh, really?

702
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,374
Do you want me to cook it for you?

703
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,668
Um, sure. Thanks.

704
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,962
When I cook ramen, my family goes crazy.

705
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,755
They keep telling me
I should start a restaurant.

706
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,173
Hold on just a moment.

707
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,342
I'm so sorry.

708
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,553
It's fine. You're my guest.
Of course I have to make it for you.

709
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,061
Do you mind if I add an egg to your ramen?

710
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,730
Oh, yeah.

711
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,689
Thanks.

712
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,006
MA_ROCKROCK THERE'S A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR
WHO WENT UP A MOUNTAIN

713
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,885
Jaebum.

714
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,346
What are we even doing here?

715
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,972
I'll send Chanmi a text.

716
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,101
JIHYEONY
HAS UPLOADED A NEW POST

717
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,356
JIHYEONY
HOME

718
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,440
What?

719
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,691
Jihyun's home.

720
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,862
Seems like studying was just an excuse.

721
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,114
Was your true goal to have ramen
with Ji Sooheon? Don't cross the line.

722
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,200
Sooheon, would you like
to have ramen with me at my place?

723
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,411
Osung, Chanmi says she's almost here.

724
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,332
Huh?

725
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:39,009
OK CHANMI

726
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,857
Fucking shit.

727
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,194
Ji Sooheon, you bastard.

728
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,789
What were you doing in my room, bastard?

729
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,960
Why would I go into your room?

730
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:55,961
I didn't go in there.

731
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,380
Don't lie to me, you bastard!

732
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,133
What did you do in my room?
Answer me! What did you do? Hey, Osung!

733
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,010
What are you doing?

734
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,012
You stole my phone earlier today.

735
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,680
I saw it was you, you bastard.

736
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,098
What are you talking about?

737
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,266
Come on!

738
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,851
You bastard!

739
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,323
Gi Osung.

740
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,699
Who are you?

741
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,327
I'm Detective Jin Sojung,

742
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,828
from the Special Victim's Unit
of Yongtan Police Station.

743
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,413
My father's not home yet.

744
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,166
I need you to come with me
to the police station.

745
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,751
Why should I follow you
to the police station?

746
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,085
You're under arrest.

747
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,587
What?

748
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,339
Under arrest?

749
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,008
What are you talking about?
What have I done to get arrested?

750
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,219
I'll call my father now.

751
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,846
He already knows about this.

752
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,350
I'm arresting you to prevent
possible destruction of evidence.

753
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,977
Damn it! I haven't done anything!
Let me go.

754
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,146
Follow me without resisting,
or I'll put handcuffs on you.

755
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,818
Hey, Kook Jihyun.

756
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,695
Call father right now.

757
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,847
Neunghwa Nursing Home

758
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,731
119 EMERGENCY

759
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,453
Are you okay?

760
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,872
Gi Osung just ran off suddenly.

761
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,415
We met.

762
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,541
What happened?

763
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,167
Actually, so many things happened.

764
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,420
I don't even know where to start.

765
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,840
Okay, there wasn't a phone
in Gi Osung's room.

766
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,301
Park Wonseok's wasn't there either.

767
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,304
Really?

768
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,555
But I found something else
that was strange...

769
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,766
There were lots of polaroid photos
in his drawer...

770
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,769
MOM'S NURSING HOME

771
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,896
Hold on.

772
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,897
Okay.

773
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,398
Hello?

774
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,401
Yes, hello, ma'am.

775
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,195
What?

776
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,531
My mom?

777
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,533
Uh...

778
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,119
Which hospital is she in right now?

779
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:07,319
CRITICAL CARE UNIT

780
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,490
Her heart wasn't beating when she arrived,
so we tried to resuscitate her.

781
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,742
Now she's on a ventilator.

782
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,161
We'll just try to keep her on life support
from here on out.

783
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,747
Are you saying...

784
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,417
it's unlikely she'll wake up again?

785
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,631
But she's alive.

786
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,092
Yes, she is.

787
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,843
And there could be a miracle, right?

788
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,096
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this

789
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,347
but you and your family should discuss

790
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,849
whether you'll continue
to keep her on life support.

791
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,518
It's because of the cost.

792
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,562
Once the cost reaches a certain point
you'll be billed right away.

793
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,939
If the bill isn't paid,

794
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,651
it will be difficult for us to continue
the life support treatment.

795
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,320
Okay.

796
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,656
I'll get the money together
no matter what.

797
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,492
Please.

798
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,954
Just keep my mother alive.

799
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,440
Hey, stop crying.

800
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,277
Why are you crying?

801
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,572
Because I feel so sorry.

802
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,618
I can't do anything for you.

803
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,621
I'm so sorry.

804
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,809
INNO MOTORS

805
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,521
I've never been there before.

806
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,816
And I have no idea
why my study café receipt

807
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,777
was found there.

808
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,115
On that day, from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
I was sleeping at home.

809
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,159
How many times do I have
to repeat this simple fact?

810
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,661
Your father, Gi Wangdo,
the head of the police station

811
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:27,000
hid the fact that this pass is yours.
Why would he do that?

812
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,337
You should be asking my father that.

813
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,800
What's your relationship with Ji Sooheon?

814
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,177
We go to the same school.
What other relation would we have?

815
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,180
Have you ever lent him
your study café pass?

816
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,184
Nope.

817
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,230
Why did you leave your cell phone
at the café?

818
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,439
I tend to be forgetful sometimes.

819
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,318
Are you implying
that I left it there on purpose?

820
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,530
Who did you meet that day?

821
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,741
Everyone at school.

822
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,707
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

823
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,002
-Come out for a second.
-Yes, sir.

824
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,305
TOWER STUDIO APARTMENT
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

825
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,439
If you're trying to persuade me,
I'll just head downstairs.

826
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,191
You have me all wrong.

827
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,986
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

828
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,863
I had no intention
of sweeping the evidence under the rug.

829
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,576
As a father,
all I wanted was to protect my son.

830
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,830
Look, there might be a possibility

831
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,374
that my son didn't do anything wrong,

832
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:53,503
and that he just got involved
in the case by chance.

833
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,465
I thought it might be a shock for him
to be treated as a suspect,

834
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,967
as young as he is.

835
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,306
I shouldn't have entertained that thought.

836
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,142
It was my mistake. I'm sorry.

837
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,270
If you ever try to intervene
in the investigation from this point on,

838
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,564
I'll resign.

839
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,151
And you'll have to prepare to do the same.

840
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,845
What the fuck is this?
Saying whatever the fuck you want.

841
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,639
Hey, he's got jack shit.

842
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,765
He just won the jackpot.

843
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,266
-I mean, fuck.
-Hey, hey, hey.

844
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,392
That's a stretch.

845
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,269
Honestly, you suck at this.

846
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,063
Ha, fuck off. Get out of my house, shit.

847
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,022
Idiot.

848
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,315
Hey, open the door and come on in.

849
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,650
Okay, I'll call. It's 100 thousand won.

850
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,236
Huh?

851
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,445
Gi Osung?

852
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,406
Wow, Gi Osung, what brings you here?

853
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,034
Hey, shit, come here. Have a drink.

854
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:06,993
Yeah.

855
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,746
Let's talk.

856
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,584
What? Shit. Now?

857
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,171
Get ready to lose when I come back.

858
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,846
Hey, what's up? What happened?

859
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,267
I'm coming from the police station
because I'm under investigation.

860
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,227
You? Why?

861
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,020
Because of the guy who crushed your foot.

862
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,563
Have they found that bastard?

863
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,274
Nope.

864
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,192
The bastard had one more run,

865
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,986
but this time he tried to frame me for it.

866
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,864
Are you under investigation because of it?

867
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,534
We really should find
that bastard and kill him.

868
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,994
Keep this to yourself.

869
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,622
This is just something I noticed
while they were questioning me, but...

870
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,416
I think the bastard is...

871
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,088
Ji Sooheon.

872
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,510
Ji Sooheon.

873
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,929
That bastard?

874
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,082
Who is it?

875
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,792
It's me, Sooheon.

876
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,592
It's pretty late. What's up?

877
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,267
What is it you want to tell me?

878
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,560
Tell me.

879
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,271
Hey, Soyeon.

880
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,317
Let's do it one more time.

881
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,820
Let's beat up those bastards

882
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,614
and get paid for it.

883
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,703
Have you gone mad?

884
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,998
Did you forget
that you're still a suspect?

885
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,291
Are you serious?

886
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,877
I need money, desperately.

887
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,879
My mother

888
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,924
is in the ICU now.

889
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,553
She can't survive
without being on life support.

890
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,477
Still, we can't do it.

891
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,312
It's too dangerous.

892
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,898
It will be okay.

893
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,778
-Just one more time...
-You must be crazy!

894
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,906
Get your head on straight.

895
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,117
It seriously can't happen.

896
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,828
Leave.

897
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,830
Just leave
if you're going to say nonsense.

898
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,706
I said get lost!

899
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,749
Hey.

900
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,917
Go.

901
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,169
I told you.

902
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,839
Hey, get out of here.

903
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,968
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

904
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,607
Hello.

905
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,068
Do you remember me?

906
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,862
Oh, of course. Of course.

907
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,948
But hey, what brings you here?

908
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,703
I have something to tell you.

909
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,626
We'll do it.
