1
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,336
The Lord of the Skies!

2
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,673
How fucking elegant, motherfucker.

3
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,969
- Don't tease.
- Goddamn, fucker.

4
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,391
- Your little brother?
- Yes. Alvaro. Come here, son.

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,728
- You also get a hug.
- Sir.

6
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,858
How are you doing?

7
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,695
320 million kinds of OK.

8
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,616
Doesn't it smell like the fucking
U.S. Treasury in here?

9
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,744
- This half is yours.
- Yes?

10
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,414
- Don't forget it.
- All right. We came at a good time, then.

11
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,542
A Tuesday like any other, Pacho.
You know how it is.

12
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,920
Motherfucker.

13
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,089
- Let's go to the house.
- Let's go.

14
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,509
- Son, do you like margaritas?
- Of course I do.

15
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,345
Great, because I have a Margarita
for you.

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,472
She'll suck you dry.

17
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,896
Let's go.

18
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,778
Take the money and destroy the plane.

19
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,806
- Thank you.
- Captain Calderón.

20
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,016
We're happy to be here.

21
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,394
And what brings you to Cali?

22
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,522
We've got some addresses
we want to investigate.

23
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,191
Cartel-related?

24
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,361
Not necessarily.

25
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,573
What a surprise.
DEA agents that don't trust us.

26
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,242
How did that work out
for the last two guys?

27
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:35,289
Friend, in Cali, there are more
corrupt cops than there are churches.

28
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,040
You don't trust me? I understand.

29
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:41,795
But if you want to get anything done
in Cali, you need the police's help.

30
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,965
If not me, someone else.

31
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,009
Not my rule.

32
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,344
- I understand.
- Good.

33
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,765
The addresses are linked
to cartel financial operations.

34
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:59,813
We want to put eyes on them.
See if any of the dots start connecting...

35
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,065
You've come a long way
to connect dots.

36
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,319
We work with what we've got.

37
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,364
Unless you can tell me where I can find
Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.

38
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,287
If they didn't own half of the city,
I couldn't even be sure they exist.

39
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,333
The Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.

40
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,468
He served as director at Interamericas.

41
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,386
The Rodríguez brothers' bank.

42
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,515
They later gave him
a more important job.

43
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:44,436
- Do you have an address for Jurado?
- I can get it for you.

44
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,150
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

45
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,903
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

46
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

47
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,661
Do they know what you're doing?

48
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,422
The dining room is over here.

49
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:40,135
You have a room over here.
Another one over here.

50
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,555
And here, you have the living room.

51
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,522
The dimmer is over here.

52
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,693
And you can adjust the light.

53
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,489
Well, you get the idea.

54
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,909
No. I don't understand.

55
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,120
- What don't you understand?
- Does this seem normal to you?

56
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,705
You indicated to Mr Rodríguez

57
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,666
you were uncertain
about returning to the North Valley.

58
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,587
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

59
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,799
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

60
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,927
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

61
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:28,266
- We have that dinner tonight.
- With your friends?

62
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:35,065
With the investors. They're not
going to like the six-month delay.

63
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,945
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodríguez brothers by name.

64
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,076
I know you're embarrassed
by what I do.

65
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,043
I know you did it for your family.

66
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,004
But if these people like
everything they hear tonight,

67
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,175
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

68
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,886
- Ready!
- Good.

69
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,638
A choir!

70
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,976
All right, say goodbye to Dad.
We're leaving.

71
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,105
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

72
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,274
Will you make it on time?

73
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,526
If you're wearing the dress
with the flowers, yes.

74
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,532
Let's go, girls.

75
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,995
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

76
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,999
Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

77
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:38,128
I need you to pre-sweep each
and every location on this schedule.

78
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,299
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

79
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:47,596
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

80
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,016
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

81
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,019
Jorge says that
the DEA is visiting Cali.

82
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:59,149
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

83
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,444
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

84
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,905
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

85
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:11,369
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

86
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,706
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:19,336
That's all, gentlemen.
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

88
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,635
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

89
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,305
Of course.
Do you want to practise your English?

90
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,682
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

91
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,352
Can you pick him up from the airport?

92
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,481
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

93
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,943
The second team's
never as good as the first.

94
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,710
If they were ever there at all.

95
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,089
Where are we headed next?

96
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,217
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS

97
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,383
I assume you would prefer
U.S. currency.

98
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,968
Of course.

99
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,389
Currency aside, we aren't in the habit
of paying for things in advance.

100
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,684
What guarantee do we have
that you will provide what you promise?

101
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,103
Forgive my brother.

102
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:27,232
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

103
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,651
This afternoon, our associate,
Mr Pallomari,

104
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,696
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

105
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,573
Very well.

106
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,869
The contribution should be divided
among seven men.

107
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,497
Their names are on the list.

108
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,919
All right, very well.

109
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I think it's best if Mr Pallomari deals
with my colleague, Mr Giraldo.

110
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,634
As you wish.

111
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,221
Have a great day, gentlemen.

112
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,023
Well, our surrender has been bought.
Now it must be paid for.

113
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,820
And they say we're the criminals.

114
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,573
Sons of bitches.

115
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,994
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

116
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,288
Gentlemen, I will prepare
these payments myself,

117
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,665
as soon as I'm back in the office.

118
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,710
And I'll make sure
that all of this is in order.

119
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,255
Mr Starkman is next, the lawyer.

120
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,317
The Arellano Felix brothers
are still wasting time with heroin.

121
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,779
Hey! What?
You're not going to say hello?

122
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,615
- Hello.
- Are you in a bad mood or what?

123
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,300
- Amado... this is the life.
- You guys helped me.

124
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,678
I moved the last 100 tons
in less than 50 days.

125
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,556
Tell me if we're a great team or not.

126
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:51,311
That's why we're here.
Can you handle a bigger package?

127
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,565
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother.
What do you think?

128
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,693
I can move however much you give me.

129
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,113
I just have two questions: How much?

130
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,492
And for how much longer, Pacho?

131
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:52,497
Because I know about your deal.
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

132
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,876
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

133
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,171
But we have six months
to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

134
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,258
Until then, we will honour
our commitment to you.

135
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,010
Right, and after?

136
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,514
What happens after that?

137
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,975
The business will adjust.

138
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:18,314
This I know. It will always adjust.
This will never end.

139
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,443
There will be other partners
and more drugs. But what about you?

140
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,071
What will happen to you?

141
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:30,993
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

142
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,496
You know this is a way of life.

143
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,457
It retires you when it's done with you.

144
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,921
Or are you going to start playing golf
like an old man?

145
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,645
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

146
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,985
Done.

147
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,029
It'll be my gift
to the Gentlemen of Cali.

148
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,409
All right? But... you have to come
with me to Juárez.

149
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,414
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

150
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,043
The future, Pacho.

151
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,213
The fucking future, that's all.

152
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,804
- Here's your passport.
- Thank you.

153
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,226
All right, and you board through Gate 15.

154
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,483
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you.

155
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,860
Have a great day.

156
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,195
Next.

157
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,146
SEARCH WARRANT

158
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,904
This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.
Are you playing me or what?

159
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,446
I need a tactical team sent
to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

160
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,659
<i>Copy that. Requesting a tactical team
to 15th Street and 4th Avenue.</i>

161
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,911
You do realise, don't you,

162
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,081
after we surrender,
all of this shit will end?

163
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,835
No more sitting by the pool,
smoking your cigar,

164
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,421
telling everyone what to do.

165
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,258
Look, Miguel, I'm tired
of telling people what to do.

166
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,553
And no one has ever listened to you.

167
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,890
What's the difference?

168
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,441
But you know what?

169
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,527
Never, in human history,

170
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,531
have two brothers accomplished
what we have.

171
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,745
We aren't the first people in history
to build an empire, Gilberto.

172
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,290
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

173
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,171
If mother were alive, she'd be proud.

174
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,800
Brothers are well, nephews are well,
sons are well.

175
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,974
<i>Boss, we just heard a call that
a tactical team left Jamundí Station</i>

176
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,476
<i>heading to 4th Avenue.</i>

177
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,940
- Enrique, where are you?
- Watching our visitors from the DEA.

178
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,401
They've been checking addresses
all over town.

179
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,653
But right now, they're stopped,
just doing nothing.

180
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,283
- Yes, but where are you?
- At 15th Street and 4th Avenue.

181
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,701
Enrique, fuck!

182
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,496
There's a police convoy coming at you!
Get Pallomari out of there now!

183
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,731
Answer, you bastard, answer.

184
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,278
- Hello? What's up?
<i>- Listen, it's Salcedo.</i>

185
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,031
You're going to have unwelcome guests.
Leave now.

186
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,076
I don't have time for this.
I'm supervising an important project.

187
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,621
<i>That's exactly why
I need you to get out.</i>

188
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,706
Just because you say so?

189
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,584
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

190
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,836
Listen, this is none of your business.

191
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,339
<i>I'll bet your desk is covered
with American dollars.</i>

192
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,216
<i>Look, Guillermo, please.</i>

193
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,928
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

194
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,346
- Jorge...
<i>- Get out!</i>

195
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,932
You do your job and I'll do mine.

196
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,435
This is my job!
I'm telling you... Son of a bitch!

197
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,964
Fuck your mother.

198
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,508
I need you to check
the paper shredders

199
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,635
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

200
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,889
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

201
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,769
Let's go.

202
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,756
Fucking shit!

203
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,526
- Gentlemen, how may I help you?
- Seventh floor. Mr Pallomari's office.

204
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,238
All right. I'll let them know
you're here so you can head up.

205
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,949
People love surprises.

206
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,785
Gentlemen, you can't...

207
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,781
What the fuck are you still doing here?

208
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,700
What the fuck am I doing? My job.
We told your associate the same thing.

209
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,369
I tried, but he won't listen.

210
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,371
- Get the car.
- Please get out.

211
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,207
- I have to finish this. Fuck your mother.
- Take the back stairs.

212
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:41,377
- Finish what?
- My job, Jorge.

213
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,131
No. Please, we have to get rid
of all of that now!

214
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,342
We aren't arguing.
You aren't touching anything.

215
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,470
- I've got a method and a system.
- A method and a system?

216
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,099
Yes? What you've got is ten years
of jail time sitting on your desk, idiot!

217
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,725
- Get out.
- No.

218
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
Attention! Colombian National Police!

219
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,358
- Where are the files?
- Get to work. Let's go!

220
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,404
This is an office.

221
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,240
We're working. How can I help you?

222
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,660
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

223
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,125
If that's the case,
I need to see a warrant.

224
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,044
Are you supposed to be in charge?

225
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,382
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

226
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,910
Good morning.
I have to see every invoice you have.

227
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,172
This says documents only.
Fuck your mother.

228
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:16,138
You didn't get that?
Only papers. Documents only.

229
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,310
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

230
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,197
Leave it. Let it be.

231
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,449
Chivo, check everything
and make an inventory, all right?

232
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:48,629
That's private.

233
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,881
Ignacio, please show the gentleman
last year's documents.

234
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,591
This way, please.

235
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,974
I must insist.

236
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,207
Do you have a bill of lading?
Yes? Let me see.

237
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,835
More? Everything.

238
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,253
- Just these?
- And the copies below.

239
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,713
- These as well, no?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,673
- All right. '93. Yeah?
- Those are the most recent.

241
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,638
EVIDENCE

242
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,393
Grab that.

243
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,531
This 24-hour party thing...

244
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,368
It's tiring after a couple of days.

245
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,250
Can you imagine if it was your life?

246
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,715
What's on your mind?

247
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,511
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

248
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,056
What? "Get the fuck out"?

249
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,474
No.

250
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,395
He said that in this world...

251
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:21,109
there was no place for a man like me.

252
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,449
I made a place for myself.

253
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,078
I proved him wrong.

254
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,583
And now, I have to give it all up.

255
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,216
What kind of man would I be
if I gave it all up?

256
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,093
I don't know, brother.

257
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,848
But what I do know is that
you have a couple of billion dollars

258
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,268
and the rest of your life
to figure it out.

259
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,530
<i>- What are they giving me?</i>
- What do you mean, "giving you"?

260
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:11,535
They took my son, didn't they?
They have to give us something.

261
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,458
- Have they offered you something?
- An apartment.

262
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,628
<i>Accept it.
Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.</i>

263
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,590
<i>We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.</i>

264
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,510
<i>- Do it, then get back up here.</i>
- Can you wake Pedro up?

265
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,681
- I want to speak with him.
<i>- Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.</i>

266
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,566
I heard we cut it close today.

267
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,277
I thought they didn't have a warrant.

268
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,446
That's what I was told
by our friend on the force.

269
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:51,074
A few more seconds
and we'd have had real trouble.

270
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,786
Those new DEA guys
are sharper than they look.

271
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,706
Well, luckily, we have you.

272
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,544
- Did they get anything?
- Some files.

273
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,298
So nothing. Good.
I'll take care of the rest today.

274
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:10,802
That thing you've got tonight
with Paola, enjoy yourself. Go on.

275
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,230
But anything we find
we'll be sure to share with you.

276
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,233
I was instructed
you should be back in Bogotátonight.

277
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,777
You're going out on the last flight.

278
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:12,765
- And where are they now?
<i>- I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.</i>

279
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:14,726
- And the files?
<i>- We've got them.</i>

280
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,269
Are you sure?

281
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,106
Look, they tricked me
with that fucking warrant, all right?

282
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,861
<i>And I couldn't warn you because
we were together like a fucking family.</i>

283
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,156
These Americans know
what they're doing.

284
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:31,367
<i>They're not fucking idiots.</i>

285
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,914
Well, the truth is, we're very interested
in your proposal, Jorge.

286
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,125
And in your potential for growth.

287
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,254
You've exceeded Paola's description,
which wasn't easy.

288
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,509
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay,

289
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,511
which took us by surprise.

290
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,516
I take my commitments very seriously,
gentlemen.

291
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,020
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
that my replacement met the standard

292
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,938
they've come to expect.

293
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,192
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

294
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,283
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

295
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,409
Yes.

296
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,163
Look at that son of a bitch.

297
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,292
Thinks his shit doesn't stink,
or what?

298
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,509
Thank you.

299
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:59,974
So, a security expert married to a rising
star in one of Cali's top law firms.

300
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,226
Have you worked together before?

301
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,065
My compliments.

302
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,152
David Rodríguez.

303
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,073
How are you?

304
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,371
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

305
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,793
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

306
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,711
Seriously.

307
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:33,466
In fact, he's one of our best men,
you see.

308
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,720
Enjoy it.

309
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,389
Ma'am.

310
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:56,906
You... Where do you know him from?
Is he a friend of yours?

311
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,992
You know Cali is a very small city.

312
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:04,247
Even more so
when one is in the security business.

313
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,916
One must deal with all sorts of people.

314
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,050
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

315
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,178
These documents are very sensitive.

316
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,515
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

317
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,185
All right. Let's go, then.

318
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,944
Open the door, Cordova.

319
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,071
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari.

320
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,282
In the front seat!

321
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,034
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

322
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,996
In the front.
I'm not your fucking employee.

323
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,265
Look, I haven't been able to reach
an agreement yet. He's very stubborn.

324
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,101
<i>Listen to me, Pacho.
We have to seal the deal.</i>

325
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,312
<i>It's very important.</i>

326
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:55,858
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

327
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,694
<i>All right. Keep me informed.</i>

328
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,405
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night, Gilberto.

329
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,798
Compliments of Mr Carrillo.

330
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,462
It's been a long time
since anyone asked me on a date.

331
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,589
Come in, please.

332
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,929
Take a seat.

333
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:11,809
Sir, your offer of this apartment
is very generous.

334
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,104
But?

335
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:19,275
But... I would like to know the terms.

336
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,362
The terms?

337
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,407
How often will you come here
to visit me?

338
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,037
As often as you like.

339
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:32,580
Or never.

340
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,499
This is your home.

341
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,626
Is there a monthly stipend?

342
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,338
A stipend?

343
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:45,051
Mr Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar
when I was 18 years old.

344
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,053
I knew nothing.

345
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:52,558
Now I need to get away from his family,
and I need my son back.

346
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,269
If you could help me with that...

347
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,731
I can.

348
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,860
Then I accept.

349
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,034
It's good to hear that.

350
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:27,426
Why don't you get some rest,
have something to eat?

351
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,554
And tomorrow morning,
I'll send for your son.

352
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,225
How does that sound?

353
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,019
Good.

354
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,771
Take a seat.

355
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,674
Sorry to interrupt.
