money in the evening?

- I'll tell you in the evening.
- [Madhu] <i>Hey.</i>

alright or not?

- Is she your wife?
- Yes.

I'm Nityanand,

If you face any trouble,
you can tell me unhesitatingly.

179
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:49,132
No. Everything is fine.

180
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:53,033
I was asking your wife
what brings you here?

181
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,829
Have you come with the
hope of conceiving a child?

182
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,090
Yes.

183
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,670
Why are you feeling shy?

184
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,391
You're not the only one
who has come here with this hope.

Tomorrow night take a dip
in the river Ganges thrice.

And pray for a child
with a pure heart.

You'll make me a sinner.

Did you hear the voice
in the background?

197
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,442
He's done an internet call
for ransom, so...

198
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,624
it's difficult to find the
accurate location of the call.

199
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,930
Sir, if you say,
shall I tap your calls?

200
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,557
Keep your mouth shut.

201
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,980
I've told you a thousand times
that no one should know about this.

202
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,147
Can't you understand this?

203
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,209
And now you're showing me
sympathy.

204
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,520
I kept four men to keep
an eye on my daughter.

205
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,143
There were CCTV cameras, but
then too my daughter got kidnapped.

206
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,738
This was your arrangement,
idiot.

207
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,851
Listen, if anything happens
to my daughter

208
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,957
then I'll make sure that you
and your company go bankrupt.

209
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,665
Sir! Why are you thinking negative?

210
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,784
This is the game of a rookie.

211
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,143
Don't mind, sir.

212
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,116
It's a point to wonder.
He has asked for only two crores

213
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,891
when he could have
asked for 20 crores.

214
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,574
He's not a professional, sir.

215
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,010
He's a needy.

216
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,411
This needy person knows

217
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,477
the game of ransom very well, sir.

218
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,354
I told you to stay away
from the window.

219

There's no water,
so I've kept one bucket for you.

You can take bath if you want.

You've showed your true colors.

And now
when your husband has come. So...

That man assaulted me
without knowing anything.

263

Then too I gave him respect.
Just because of you.

Or else I could have
also given him back.

If I wanted,
I could have given him 3-4 slaps.

Please go there.

you spoke about breakup.

Ranjana, you're
being selfish now.

274
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:26,463
Our relationship
is not worth Rs.70000.

275

You're unable to see my
contribution and sacrifice.

I'm having an affair.

What would she have gone through?
Have you thought about that?

281
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,932
I thought of divorcing
my wife three time.

- Mr. Dubey, leave my hand.
- Sorry I can't.

Well, this isn't about sex.

285
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,209
I'll get sex anywhere.

286
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,066
But what about this heart? Tell me.

287
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:10,067
Ranjana, listen to me.

288
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:14,528
At times you can come and meet me
under the excuse of shopping.

00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,636
that called her constantly.

296
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:46,107
She spoke to this number last.
Whose number is this, sir?

What are you trying to say?

298
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:57,882
You have called Anusha
in the evening roughly 8-10 times.

What were you both up to?

Do you want to
talk in front of him?

301

Yes, why not?

302
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,665
That girl had gone
for a wedding.

for clothes, makeup and hair?

308
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:40,808
Tell me. Why is it blank?

It doesn't work if the
memory is even a little full.

311
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm carrying this because
this is all that I can afford.

312
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,153
Why don't you gift me a new phone
if you're feeling so bad?

313
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:59,413
Can I see your phone once?

No. Actually, I can solve
your memory problem. That's all.

00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,410
- Listen.
- Sir has come.

316
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,736
Everyone head to Rishikesh now.

317
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:37,490
And check all the hotels
and lodges near the banks.

318
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:40,391
Anusha should be back safely.
Get out!

319
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:44,379
And shoot anyone
who comes your way. Come on.

320
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,283
- Yes, sir.

322
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:54,045
Hello.

323
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:55,510
Listen to what you have to do.

324
00:21:56,382 --> 00:22:00,294
- After an hour take the money and...
- Listen...

325
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,228
I've still not made
arrangements for money.

326
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:06,409
- What?
- [Tyagi] <i>Well, it's a Sunday</i>

327
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,930
<i>so banks are closed.</i>

328
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:11,773
I checked my factory and home. But
I could only arrange for one crore.

329
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,041
<i> You know, I can't keep a lot
of cash after demonetization.</i>

330
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:17,499
- Listen...
- <i>Try to understand my helplessness.</i>

331
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,229
<i>I can't ask from anyone here.</i>

332
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:21,256
Everything will be revealed.

333
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:25,327
<i>But please don't
harm my daughter.</i>

334
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:28,839
<i>Hello!
Please say something. Hello. </i>

335
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:31,321
Tyagi, if this is your game,
then...

336
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:35,716
<i>I seriously swear on my daughter
that this is not a game.</i>

337
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:55,367
