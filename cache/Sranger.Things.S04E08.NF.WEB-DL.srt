1
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,083
What have you done?

2
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,595
What have you done?

3
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,381
All done.

4
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,552
Not so bad, was it?

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,804
See?

6
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,557
There's nothing to be afraid of.

7
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,434
Is there, Nancy?

8
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,940
Why don't you take a seat?

9
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,736
No!

10
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,504
Nancy, just stay with me.
Stay with me, okay?

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,373
Whatever you guys are doing, hurry up!

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,085
Steve says you need to hurry!

13
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,671
- Yeah? No shit!
- We're trying. We can't find anything.

14
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,507
- What is all this shit?
- What are you even looking for?

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,969
Madonna, Blondie, Bowie, Beatles?
Music! We need music!

16
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,138
This is music!

17
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,896
Son of a…

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,649
God!

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,193
Nancy.

20
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,742
What are you doing?

21
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,955
It's not time for you to leave.

22
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,507
Now that you've seen where I've been…

23
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,221
…I would like very much to show you

24
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,473
where I am going.

25
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,860
Take a seat, Nancy.

26
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,736
I…

27
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,406
Want you to tell

28
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,533
Eleven.

29
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,871
I want you to tell her

30
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,291
everything you see.

31
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,839
No!

32
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,091
No!

33
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,887
- Tell her…
- No!

34
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,390
…everything.

35
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,934
No!

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,687
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,356
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

38
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,484
It's okay. I'm here.

39
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,611
I'm right here.

40
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,199
What's going on there?

41
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,618
Get the power back on!

42
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,247
Tell him that the prisoners
are contained...

43
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
and that you're working on the power.

44
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,002
Tell him!

45
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,962
And that door there, where does it lead?

46
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,172
To... to cell block two...

47
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,216
No cell blocks!

48
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,593
I need a safe way out of here.

49
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,615
Guess you got my message, huh?

50
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,691
Oh, no, I just have always wanted
to visit the Soviet Union.

51
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,360
With Murray.

52
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,112
You two getting along?

53
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,574
He's the Star sky to my Hutch.

54
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,577
I thought you were dead.

55
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,540
Thought I lost you.

56
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,294
I did lose you.

57
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,381
For eight months.

58
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,385
We had a funeral.

59
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,721
Anybody show?

60
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,306
Are you kidding?

61
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,685
You're the hero of Hawkins.

62
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,855
It's true.

63
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,110
Yeah, I always felt
I'd be easier to like when I was dead.

64
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,364
How about El?

65
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,284
She's good.

66
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,621
She misses her dad.

67
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,374
We all do.

68
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,044
Uh, I hate to interrupt,

69
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,006
but apparently, they can climb too.

70
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,138
Lower your weapons.

71
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,806
Lower your weapons!

72
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,184
Don't shoot!

73
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,399
Stop!

74
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,026
The hell is that?

75
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,451
Please tell me they don't have
another one of those things.

76
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,946
You can't go in there!

77
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
It's dangerous!

78
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,219
It's dangerous!

79
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,677
Oh my God.

80
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,528
The hell are they doing?

81
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,313
Hey.

82
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,482
Found something.

83
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,287
- Think this'll lead us outta here?
- I give it a hundred to one odds.

84
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,389
<i>And one, two, three.</i>

85
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,101
<i>And one, two, three.</i>

86
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,186
<i>Again.</i>

87
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,313
<i>One, two, three.</i>

88
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,988
Pulse is dropping.
One-fifty now. BP's 160…

89
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,536
How do you feel?

90
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,872
Can you hear us?

91
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,292
Eleven. Can you hear us?

92
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,299
No, leave her.

93
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,094
Hi, Jane.

94
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,249
Holy shit, dude. Check it out.

95
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,377
I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.

96
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,839
Watch out, Domino's.

97
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,717
Your dominoes are gonna fall.

98
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,470
How far is Nina from Vegas?

99
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
From Vegas?

100
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,224
Um, as long as
Suzie's coordinates are right,

101
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,101
about another 90 miles. Why?

102
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,646
Well, once we save her, El,
we should stop on the way back.

103
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,191
El could make us, like, super rich,
and we'd never have to work.

104
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,029
We could just play D&D and Nintendo
for the rest of our lives.

105
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,822
Yeah. Totally.

106
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,624
We're gonna make it, Mike.
She's gonna be okay.

107
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,496
Yeah, I know. I… I know she is.

108
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,250
But… But what if
after all this is over, she…

109
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,629
Sh… she doesn't need me anymore?

110
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,505
No, o… of course she'll still need you.

111
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
She'll always need you, Mike.

112
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,926
I keep telling myself that, but I…

113
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,303
I don't believe it.

114
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,889
I mean, she's special.

115
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,474
She was born special.

116
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,143
Maybe I was one of the first people
to realize that.

117
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,480
But the truth is,
when I stumbled on her in the woods,

118
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,981
she just needed someone.

119
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,568
It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny.
It's just simple dumb luck.

120
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,279
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

121
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,448
that got lucky
that Superman landed on his doorstep.

122
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,408
I mean, at least Lois Lane

123
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,911
is an ace reporter
for the <i>Daily Planet,</i> right? But…

124
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,289
- Sorry.
- No.

125
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,376
No, I… it's so stupid,
given everything that's going on.

126
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,753
It's just… I… I don't know, I just…

127
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,087
Uh…

128
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,631
You're scared of losing her.

129
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,260
Can I show you something?

130
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,199
This is amazing.

131
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,159
Did you paint this?

132
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,704
Yeah. Yeah. I mean…

133
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,039
I mean… I mean, El asked me to.

134
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,459
She commissioned it, basically.
I mean, she told me what to draw.

135
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
Anyway, my point is,

136
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,547
see how you're leading us here?

137
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,841
You're guiding the whole party,
inspiring us.

138
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,426
That… That's what you do.

139
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,012
And see your coat of arms here?
It's a heart.

140
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
And I know it's sort of on the nose,

141
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,057
but that's what
holds this party together. Heart.

142
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,145
Because, I mean,
without heart, we'd all fall apart.

143
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,939
Even El. Especially El.

144
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:10,195
These past few months,
she's been so lost without you.

145
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,283
It's just, she's so different
from other people, and…

146
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,953
…when you're…
when you're different,

147
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,455
sometimes…

148
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,999
…you feel like a mistake.

149
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,170
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

150
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,172
Like she's better for being different.

151
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,935
And that gives her
the courage to fight on.

152
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,467
If she was mean to you

153
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,719
or she seemed like
she was pushing you away,

154
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,805
it's because she's scared of losing you,
like you're scared of losing her.

155
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,599
And if she was going to lose you,

156
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,851
I… I think she'd rather just
get it over with quick.

157
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,352
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

158
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,856
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.

159
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
And she always will.

160
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,194
Yeah?

161
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,111
Yeah.

162
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>After the attack,</i>

163
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,845
you fell into a coma.

164
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,391
Like One, you had pushed yourself
beyond your limit.

165
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,853
And it very nearly destroyed you.

166
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,523
But that is where your similarities ended.

167
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,734
<i>What you displayed that day</i>

168
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,571
<i>was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.</i>

169
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>A potential I'd only dreamed of.</i>

170
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,039
<i>But when you awoke,</i>

171
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>something had been lost.</i>

172
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,128
<i>Your memories,</i>

173
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,756
<i>along with whatever else
you'd found within yourself that day.</i>

174
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,177
<i>But I knew then, just as I knew today,</i>

175
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,262
that your powers had not been lost.

176
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,015
They just needed a spark.

177
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,435
But that day,

178
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,021
you awakened something else.

179
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,148
A doorway to another world.

180
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,987
I always thought that Henry was out there,

181
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,239
hiding in the darkness.

182
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>I didn't know for sure,
not beyond a feeling.</i>

183
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,954
Until now.

184
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,003
He's claimed three victims so far,
and when I saw the eyes,

185
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,589
I knew… I knew that was him.

186
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,676
He was sending us a message,
letting us know he's back.

187
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,971
That's when I came to see you.

188
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,103
My friends.

189
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,773
Well, we… we haven't risked contact,

190
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,733
but, as far as we know,

191
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,652
they're… they're all safe.

192
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.

193
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,449
Your friends are in terrible danger.

194
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,952
With each victim he takes,

195
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,035
Henry is…

196
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,041
Chiseling away at the barrier that exists
between our two worlds.

197
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
"Chiseling"?

198
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,836
Imagine, if you will,

199
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,172
the barrier between our worlds is a…

200
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,132
Concrete dam.

201
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,595
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.

202
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,348
Cracks in dams

203
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,599
create pressure.

204
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,851
Left unchecked,

205
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,354
the pressure will build.

206
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,356
And build.

207
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,025
And eventually,
it will reach a breaking point.

208
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,653
And the dam will burst.

209
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,489
And when that happens,

210
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,075
Hawkins will fall.

211
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,001
Well, that went very well, I thought.

212
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,170
You eased her into it, nice and gentle,
just like we talked about.

213
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,547
Not ominous at all.

214
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>He showed me</i>

215
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,719
things that haven't happened yet.

216
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,514
The most awful things.

217
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,186
I saw

218
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,521
a dark cloud

219
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,107
spreading over Hawkins.

220
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,693
Downtown on fire.

221
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,488
Dead soldiers.

222
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
And this…

223
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,370
Giant creature

224
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,415
with… a gaping mouth.

225
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,292
And this creature wasn't alone.

226
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,420
There were so many monsters.

227
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,340
An army.

228
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,260
And they were coming into Hawkins.

229
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,763
Into our neighborhoods.

230
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,264
Our homes.

231
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,225
And then…

232
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,188
He showed me my mom.

233
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,191
And Holly.

234
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,984
Mike.

235
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
And they…

236
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,449
They were all…

237
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,458
Okay, but… he's just trying
to scare you, Nance.

238
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,377
Right? I mean…

239
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,796
I mean, it's not real.

240
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,922
Not yet.

241
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,136
But there… there was something else.

242
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,639
He showed me gates.

243
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,809
Four gates.

244
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,062
Spreading across Hawkins.

245
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,859
And these gates, they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer,

246
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,528
but… they didn't stop growing.

247
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,448
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

248
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,033
This was our Hawkins.

249
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,035
Our home.

250
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,999
Four chimes.

251
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,126
Vecna's clock.

252
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,422
It always chimes four times.

253
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,591
Four exactly.

254
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,886
I heard them too.

255
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,435
He's been telling us his plan
this whole time.

256
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,479
Four kills.

257
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,981
Four gates.

258
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,069
End of the world.

259
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,362
If that's true…

260
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,866
He's only one kill away.

261
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,785
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

262
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,245
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

263
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,968
- Anything?
- No.

264
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,762
Rang a few times,
then went to busy signal.

265
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,645
Maybe you punched it wrong.
Try again.

266
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,240
- I didn't punch it in wrong.
- Well, I don't know.

267
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,108
I think she knows
how to use a phone.

268
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm just saying,
she could've typed it in wrong.

269
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,109
- Same shit.
- How is that possible?

270
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,862
Joyce has this telemarketer job.
Always on the phone.

271
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Mike won't stop whining about it.

272
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,784
Yeah, but this phone's been busy
for, what, three days now?

273
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,369
That's not Joyce.

274
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,746
No way. Something's wrong.

275
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,915
She's right.

276
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,751
It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.

277
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,172
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

278
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,257
I'm sure of it.

279
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,678
But Vecna can't hurt them.

280
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,265
Not if he's dead.

281
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,351
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

282
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,186
- Whoa, no, no, no. What?
- Nope.

283
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,670
- Let's think this through.
- What is there to think through?

284
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,525
- We barely made it out of there.
- Yeah, because we weren't prepared.

285
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,945
But this time, we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

286
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,073
We'll go through the gate,
we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.

287
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,366
Or he'll kill us.

288
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,452
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

289
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,205
- He's not scared of us.
- And for good reason.

290
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,458
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

291
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,960
Sorry, what are we calling him now?

292
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,187
- One.
- Vecna.

293
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,421
- Henry.
- Right.

294
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,965
We've learned something new
about Vecna/Henry/One.

295
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,258
He's a number like Eleven,

296
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,636
only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering
version of her with really bad skin.

297
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,347
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.

298
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,392
Could turn us inside out with a snap
of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.

299
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,977
Then why fight fair?

300
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,397
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives <i>us</i> an upper hand.

301
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,149
We know Eleven's strengths.

302
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,276
And weaknesses.

303
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,694
Weaknesses?

304
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,237
When El remote-travels,

305
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,033
she goes into
this sort of trance-like state.

306
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,409
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

307
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,620
That would explain
what he was doing in that attic.

308
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,080
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,

309
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,626
I'll bet you he's back in that attic,
physical body defenseless.

310
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,794
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?

311
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,130
True. We'll have to find a way past them.

312
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,423
Distract them somehow.

313
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,967
- And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?
- No idea.

314
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,761
But once they're gone,

315
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,262
he doesn't stand a chance.

316
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,307
It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula
in his coffin.

317
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,975
That all sounds good in theory,

318
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,061
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

319
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,646
Not one that I can decipher.

320
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
We don't know
when he's going to attack next.

321
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,692
- Don't even know who he's going to attack.
- Yeah, we do.

322
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
I can still feel him.

323
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,113
I'm still marked.

324
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,449
Cursed.

325
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,661
I ditch Kate Bush,

326
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,871
I draw his focus back to me.

327
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,122
Max.

328
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,290
You can't.

329
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,126
He'll kill you.

330
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,961
I survived before.

331
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,632
I can survive again.

332
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,554
I just need to keep him busy long enough
so that you guys can get into that attic.

333
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,057
Then you can chop his head off.

334
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,144
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

335
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,481
I honestly don't care
how you put this asshole in his grave.

336
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,564
Just…

337
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,985
…whatever it is…

338
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,321
Whatever you do…

339
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:23,993
Try not to miss.

340
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,297
Bam.

341
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,298
<i>Durak.</i>

342
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,841
Son of a bitch!

343
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,160
Sayonara!

344
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,168
Oh God! Oh God!

345
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,052
Son of a bitch!

346
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,160
- You okay? All right?
- Yeah.

347
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,979
- You okay?
- Okay? I'm great! Whoo!

348
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,733
Oh, nothing like a little prison escape
to get your day started, am I right?

349
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,151
We're not out of the woods yet.

350
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,363
My people do not take kindly to escapes.
They'll be hunting us.

351
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:09,117
Yeah, well, we aren't exactly
planning on sticking around.

352
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,872
- Where's the plane you came in on?
- That plane? Um, that crashed.

353
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,958
- Crashed?
- His fault.

354
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,103
A word of warning.

355
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,089
That man is more slippery
than an eel dipped in baby oil.

356
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,841
I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth.

357
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,427
My tongue. My tongue!

358
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,887
I… I can't feel my tongue.

359
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,598
We need to get out of here,
back to the States.

360
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,850
Can you get us to another plane?

361
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,933
Now?

362
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,686
You're asking for Yuri's help

363
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,689
after dragging him through miles
of shit tunnel?

364
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,276
I could have told you
we are going wrong way hours ago.

365
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,694
You Neanderthal...

366
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,238
Watch your mouth, or I am gonna take this,

367
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,782
I'm gonna rub it along
the bottom of my shoe,

368
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,328
and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.

369
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,871
Well, go ahead!

370
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,957
But then you'll never
make it out of my country alive.

371
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,584
So you <i>can</i> get us out.

372
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,503
For a glass of water and hot steam bath

373
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,341
and five-inch stack of American dollars,

374
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,053
Yuri will fly you to moon.

375
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,805
You make another demand,
you double-crossing <i>mudak,</i>

376
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,767
I'll decorate the roof of this van
with your brains.

377
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,145
Why so angry, comrade?

378
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,689
Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure.

379
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,942
But now you are free.

380
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,070
Everything works out.
Happy ending for everybody.

381
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,404
No?

382
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:33,701
For you, that will very much
depend on how you answer. Comrade.

383
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,287
Will you take us to America?

384
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,455
Yes?

385
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,917
Or no?

386
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,303
Check this out. The War Zone.

387
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,472
I've been there once.

388
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,431
It's huge.

389
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,226
They got everything you need for, uh…

390
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,728
Well, killing things, basically.

391
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,522
You think fake Rambo has
enough guns there?

392
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,191
Is that a grenade?
I mean, how is any of this legal?

393
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,235
Well, lucky for us it is, so…

394
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,196
This… This place is just far enough
outside of Hawkins.

395
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,323
As long as we steer clear of main roads,

396
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,743
we ought a be able to avoid cops
and, uh, angry hicks.

397
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,745
If we're trying to avoid angry hicks,

398
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,581
maybe we shouldn't go
to some store called the War Zone.

399
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,418
Normally, I'd agree,
but we need the weapons.

400
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,837
- So I think it's worth the risk.
- Me too.

401
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,007
But is it worth the time?
It'll take all day to bike there and back.

402
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,051
- Who said anything about bikes?
- You got some car we don't know about?

403
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,637
It's not exactly a car, Steve.

404
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,386
And it's not exactly mine,

405
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,808
but, uh… it'll do.

406
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:44,647
Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask
or a bandanna, something like that?

407
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,062
That was suffocating.

408
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,688
Go! Come on.

409
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,245
Where'd you learn how to do this?

410
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,249
Well, when the other dads were teaching
their kids how to fish or play ball,

411
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,919
my old man was teaching me
how to hot-wire.

412
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:52,340
Now, I swore to myself
I wouldn't wind up like he did,

413
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,051
but now I'm wanted for murder,

414
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,928
and soon, grand theft auto.

415
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,847
So, uh, I'm really living up to
that Munson name.

416
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,226
Eddie, I'm not sure
I love the idea of you driving.

417
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,521
Oh, I'm just starting this sucker.
Harrington's got her.

418
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,855
Don't ya, big boy?

419
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,652
What the hell?

420
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,278
Hey! Open this door!

421
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,156
- Hey!
- They locked the door!

422
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,241
Shit! Go.

423
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,869
It's just a car.
Everybody, hang on to something!

424
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,473
Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!

425
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,498
Drive, Steve! Drive!

426
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,791
Go, go, go!

427
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,422
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

428
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,882
Shit, they look pissed.

429
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,177
It's not every day you lose
your house and car in one fell swoop.

430
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,305
Hold on! Hold on!

431
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,937
Them!

432
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,273
Stop 'em! God bless it!

433
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,607
Okay.

434
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,137
My friends. I saw them.
You told me they were safe.

435
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,764
- They are not safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

436
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,850
Uh, just give us a second, please.

437
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,767
Please.

438
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,147
Okay, okay, first… first things first.

439
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,941
We're not gonna let anything happen
to your friends, okay, kiddo?

440
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,985
I will personally make sure of that.

441
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,696
Did… Did you see where they were?

442
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,532
They were at… They were at Max's house.

443
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,367
They're planning to kill him.

444
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,493
To kill Henry.

445
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,579
Okay. Okay.

446
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,457
This… Does this Max have a last name?

447
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,126
Max… Max Mayfield.

448
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,045
Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.

449
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,090
I have people in Hawkins,
and I'm gonna send some to Max Mayfield.

450
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,926
- And they will stop him...
- Her.

451
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,303
Stop her. And the rest of them

452
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,847
from whatever foolish,
although well-intentioned, mission

453
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,251
that they're attempting, alright?

454
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,684
No. No, do not send your men.

455
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,685
Send me.

456
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,064
Your friends are not prepared
for this fight, Eleven.

457
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
And neither are you.

458
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,527
You must understand,

459
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,364
when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.

460
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,199
He consumes.

461
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,077
He takes everything from his victims.

462
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,788
Everything they are
and everything they ever will be.

463
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,415
Their memories, their abilities.

464
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,754
And we do not know
where he's been these lost years.

465
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,007
But if he has survived this long,

466
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,008
we can only assume

467
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,594
that he has grown in strength.

468
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,931
To underestimate him,

469
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,849
to act rashly,

470
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,685
would be very dangerous.

471
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,565
I don't want to upset you, Eleven.

472
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,443
What you've accomplished
is nothing short of a miracle.

473
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,447
You came to me broken.

474
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,284
And you've learned to walk again.

475
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,786
But if you want to stop One,

476
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,622
you will need to do more than walk.

477
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,499
You will need to do more than run.

478
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,544
You will need to fly.

479
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,005
And you're not ready.

480
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,425
My friends need me.

481
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,137
I've stopped him once. I will again.

482
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,014
I'm sorry. You can't.

483
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,640
It's impossible.

484
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,766
Nothing's impossible.

485
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,980
I can call Stinson. She's got connections
at Nellis. That's two hours away.

486
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,025
And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be
in Hawkins before nightfall.

487
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,526
That would be a grave mistake.

488
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,862
Waiting would be an even greater mistake.

489
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,280
What if One makes his move

490
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,490
before we've had a chance
to throw a punch?

491
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,117
Then what is the point of all this?

492
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,202
That's a risk we're going to have to take.

493
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,414
We pushed her before
and look what happened.

494
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,959
She lifted a 10,000-pound tank
into the goddamn air.

495
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,919
You don't understand what he's capable of!

496
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,881
Maybe you're right.
Or maybe you are overestimating him.

497
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,509
Either way, doesn't matter
because this is not our choice.

498
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,678
We agreed this was not gonna be a prison.

499
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,013
We'll show her what this is,

500
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,431
what we can offer,

501
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,018
and then it is her choice
whether she wants to stay or go.

502
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,101
Right, Doc?

503
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,897
You may not agree with it,

504
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,775
but here she is, standing before us,

505
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,610
making a choice.

506
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,280
You're sure you wanna do this?

507
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,578
Okay. Pack your things, say your goodbyes.

508
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,861
- How's it handle?
- Not half bad.

509
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,364
Considering that this is a…

510
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,699
House.

511
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,997
Yeah, it's…

512
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,709
It's silly, but I… I've actually…

513
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,756
I always had this dream that I'd have
this really… really big family.

514
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,341
I'm talking, like, uh,

515
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,093
a full brood of Harringtons.

516
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,719
Like, five, six kids.

517
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,805
- Six?
- Yeah. Six little nuggets.

518
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,515
Three girls, three boys.

519
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,062
And… and every summer,
I figured all of us Harringtons,

520
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,983
we would pack into something like this

521
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,194
and… just see the country.

522
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,614
You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon,

523
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
maybe Yellowstone.

524
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,872
End up in some beach side town
in California.

525
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,124
Spend a week parked in the sand.

526
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,378
Learn how to surf or something.

527
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,007
That sounds nice.

528
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,050
Yeah?

529
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,469
Yeah.

530
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,142
Well, uh, except for the six-kid part.

531
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,145
That sounds like a total nightmare.

532
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,189
If only I had some practice.

533
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,441
All right. Fair.

534
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,693
That's fair.

535
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,918
Hey.

536
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,382
So I've been thinking,

537
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,303
two of the three of Vecna's victims
were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?

538
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,721
- Yeah.
- Okay.

539
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,642
So I figure there's a good chance
Vecna cursed another one of her students.

540
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,020
We go back to her office.
We read all of her files.

541
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,814
Look for mentions of headaches,
nosebleeds, nightmares.

542
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,526
- We identify his most likely next victim.
- Lucas.

543
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,249
- We stake out his house...
- Lucas, stop.

544
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,905
We don't have time for any of that, okay?

545
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,532
And even if we did,

546
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,493
even if your plan did work,

547
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,913
we'd be putting a total stranger at risk.

548
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,374
A stranger who has no idea
what they're up against.

549
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,874
I do.

550
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,920
He uses my memories against me.

551
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,341
But… only my darkest memories.

552
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,678
- Same with Chrissy and Fred, right?
- Right.

553
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,305
It's like he only sees the darkness in us.

554
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,644
So, I'll just run
in the opposite direction.

555
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,814
Run to the light.

556
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,026
And maybe he won't be able
to find me there.

557
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,697
Now, how exactly
do you plan on doing this?

558
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,407
I'm not sure.

559
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,036
But it's my mind.

560
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,414
Not his, right?

561
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,834
So I should be able to control where I am.

562
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,920
I just need to… push him away.

563
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,924
Find a happy memory and hide there.

564
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,969
Hide in the light.

565
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,724
You got a memory in mind?

566
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,059
Yeah.

567
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,605
It was a time when I was

568
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,232
the happiest.

569
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,075
Was I there?

570
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,330
That's presumptuous of you.

571
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,416
But yeah.

572
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,877
You might've been there.

573
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,841
Okay, but the second you start to lift,

574
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,302
I'm calling in Kate Bush.

575
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,512
- All right?
- Okay.

576
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,349
- Deal.
- Deal.

577
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,426
Heh, come on. This way.

578
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,848
If I get a whiff
of any funny business, smuggler...

579
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,725
I will not hesitate to kill you.

580
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,104
In fact... I am just looking for a reason.
Understand?

581
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,941
Are you a parrot, cop?
You keep repeating the same thing.

582
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,152
You were trapped in a cell
with this dull man

583
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,030
and you didn't take opportunity
to smother him.

584
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,336
Beautiful, yes?

585
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,880
Please tell me this is another poor joke.

586
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,759
You said you had a plane.

587
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,636
- A plane!
- No, no, no.

588
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,972
I… I told you I could fly you home.

589
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,684
And Katinka can fly you home, little bird.

590
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,187
She was named Katinka
after my first lover.

591
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,483
Katinka also had
very beautiful, very round buttocks.

592
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,110
Uh, mu… much like this.

593
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,116
This cannot fly us to America.

594
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,367
Why not?

595
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,619
As long as winds are not too strong

596
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,373
and your military friends
do not shoot us out of sky,

597
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
we can make it to the coast.

598
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,877
There, while we refuel,

599
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,796
we skin dip in ice-cold water
and wash off this muck.

600
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,924
Then we fly her rest of the way.

601
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,217
Happy ending.

602
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:06,138
Okay, what is the furthest
Katinka has ever flown?

603
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,517
For me, she is still a virgin.

604
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,062
Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no.

605
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,108
That Katinka, no.

606
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,069
But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled.

607
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,073
But I'm sure she will soar
when given a chance.

608
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,618
She just need little tune-up.

609
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,791
- I did warn you, Jim.
- Okay.

610
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,709
Should I shoot him now? Or later?

611
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,211
What about Owens?

612
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:42,257
He… He's gotta have contacts or spies here
that could help us.

613
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,467
Can we do that?

614
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,303
Can we make a call to the States?

615
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,899
Yes, hello, miss.

616
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:03,779
I'd like to place a call to
the United States. A very sick relative.

617
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,824
Correct. Yes... The number is...

618
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,160
- The number?
- It's 775…

619
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,788
…305…

620
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,456
…3450.

621
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:18,877
<i>Da, spasibo.</i>

622
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,174
- What are you doing?
- How exactly do you think this works?

623
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,177
They will make the call for us,
and then they will call us back.

624
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,637
How long's that gonna take?

625
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,723
Five minutes. Five hours.

626
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,892
Five days. Who knows?

627
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,687
And when we do get the call,

628
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,649
assume the KGB will be on the other line,
listening to everything you say.

629
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,732
So,

630
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,194
I suggest talking in code.

631
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,488
Say the wrong thing

632
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,158
and they will be on us like flies on shit.

633
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,120
Welcome to the Soviet Union.

634
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,102
So much for avoiding angry hicks.

635
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,438
Let's be… fast.

636
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,981
- Yep.
- Definitely.

637
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,330
- How many of these do you think we need?
- Five or six.

638
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,758
What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk?

639
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,841
Shut up.

640
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,427
Ah!

641
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,181
Jesus, you scared me.

642
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,391
Whoa. You gonna mace me with that?

643
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,602
If it keeps you in line, yeah.

644
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,111
See? Not so scary.

645
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,330
Robin. Robin!

646
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,790
Who's that?

647
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,210
Someone from band.

648
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,757
How much is this?

649
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,928
$120.99, but I'll throw in
20 rounds of buckshot for ya.

650
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,891
Hey, can I see
this real pretty .357, please?

651
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,477
Sure thing.

652
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,814
- Here you go, son.
- Thank you.

653
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,902
Nancy Wheeler.

654
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,658
Wouldn't expect to find you here.

655
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:59,162
Yeah, well, it's just… scary times.

656
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:08,880
I'm… sorry about Chrissy.

657
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,053
Want my advice?

658
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,766
Shotguns are not good for much of anything
past killing small birds.

659
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,979
I mean, they got power, sure,

660
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,564
but not much range.

661
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,735
And that's just gonna force you
into close-range combat,

662
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,778
then someone can
just grab that barrel like this…

663
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,489
…and redirect it.

664
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,836
Well, you look nervous.

665
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,379
Like I said,

666
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,300
scary times.

667
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,180
Now, your brother, he, uh…

668
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,892
Is he here with you, by chance?

669
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,476
Mike?

670
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,145
Mike.

671
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,812
No.

672
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,274
I only ask because he's…

673
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,070
He's in Hellfire, isn't he?

674
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,044
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about his friends?

675
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,117
They here with you?

676
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,078
Would you let go?

677
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,040
Let go.

678
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,589
What the hell is taking so long?

679
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,300
- What happened?
- Gotta go.

680
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,427
- Your old friends are here.
- Shit!

681
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,889
- Let's go! Let's go!
- I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!

682
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,785
Should be up on our right.

683
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,411
There's nothing out here.

684
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,499
Mmm. We there already?

685
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:11,461
- Already? It's been nine hours.
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.

686
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,296
What are we looking for, my dudes?

687
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,174
- Some sort of facility.
- A fence. A building.

688
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,884
Any signs of life would be nice.

689
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,763
Since when did we decide Nina
was a building and not a small woman?

690
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,349
Sounds like a small woman to me.

691
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,809
It's not a small woman.

692
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,186
Small woman out in this desert
would be hard to see.

693
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,648
- How is he still high?
- Sure you got your measurements right?

694
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,731
Yes, they're right.

695
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,234
- You're 100%, right?
- Yes.

696
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,403
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.

697
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,656
- Are you really questioning Suzie?
- She's a genius, Jonathan.

698
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,783
- Even geniuses make mistakes.
- Well, she didn't.

699
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,287
If that small woman is small enough,
she could fit behind a small tree.

700
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,413
Stop! Just…

701
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,376
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

702
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,795
I am stopping us before we get more lost.

703
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,341
- Give me the coordinates.
- Um, okay.

704
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,803
Longitude is 116 degrees,
five minutes, and 17...

705
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,054
Slow down. Slow down.

706
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,432
Nina!

707
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,604
Nina.

708
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,397
Nina?

709
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,776
Nina!

710
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,703
Holy macaroni.

711
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:30,498
All right. You just go straight down.
Like, straight… straight…

712
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,462
Right on the money, as I said.

713
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,589
- It just doesn't make sense.
- Yo, dudes!

714
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,717
My dudes!

715
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,843
Jesus Christ.

716
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,637
Come check this shit out!

717
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,055
What is it?

718
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,182
Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!

719
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,601
Come on! Hurry!

720
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,395
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!

721
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,440
Okay.

722
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,400
So no small woman named Nina.

723
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,320
But you said <i>any</i> signs of life,
am I right?

724
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,238
Right.

725
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,321
Well,

726
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,245
these are no regular
tire tracks, brochachos.

727
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,580
I mean, look at the tread
on these monsters.

728
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,000
They're fatties.
And you know what that means.

729
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,084
Military.

730
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,586
We gotta go.

731
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,296
Well, I wouldn't do it
if I didn't think she was ready.

732
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,132
But either way,
I don't think we have any other choice.

733
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,550
<i>- Do you?</i>
- No, I don't.

734
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,634
<i>Yeah.</i>

735
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,345
- It might take me some time though.
- Just… As fast as you can.

736
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,390
It's gonna take us two hours
to get to Nellis as it is.

737
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,850
And, Ellen, one more favor.

738
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,186
Can you send somebody over
to a Max Mayfield's house?

739
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,273
There are some kids there
that just need looking after, okay?

740
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,276
Ellen? Hello?

741
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,819
Sam? Hello?

742
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,951
Why the long face, Doc?

743
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,911
We just wanna talk.

744
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,619
No! Wait!

745
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,163
No! No!

746
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
What…

747
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,008
You can't leave, Eleven.

748
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,641
Where is Dr. Owens?

749
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,726
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

750
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,648
I know you wish to go to him,

751
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,359
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

752
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,860
from forcing open that door.

753
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,905
But if my men hear you coming,

754
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,781
they will kill him.

755
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,705
And alone, you will never find your way
out of this desert to your friends.

756
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,583
Here's what we're going to do.

757
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,963
You and I are going to complete
our work together.

758
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,550
And when I decide that you are ready,

759
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,594
we will return to Hawkins, together.

760
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,847
Papa and daughter.

761
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,476
Why are you doing this?

762
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,728
Because there's no other choice.

763
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,021
There is a choice.

764
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,899
Only one that is right.

765
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,027
And you make the right choices?

766
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,779
I try.

767
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,198
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

768
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
Four-fifty.

769
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,955
Your mother was sick, Eleven.

770
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,458
She was a danger to herself and to others.

771
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,294
She brought a gun into the hospital.
She killed a man.

772
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,837
Hospital?

773
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,838
No.

774
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,300
A prison.

775
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,970
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

776
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,388
For your own protection.

777
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,139
And Henry?

778
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,144
You kept Henry in that lab.

779
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,645
With the children.

780
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,063
Was that for our good?

781
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,857
Was that a right choice?

782
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,485
I had no idea what Henry would do.

783
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,487
I cared for you.

784
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,697
I loved you. I loved all of you.

785
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,781
Even Henry?

786
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,324
Yes.

787
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,204
I was trying to help Henry,
to understand him. Yes.

788
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,498
Yes, I cared for him.

789
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,126
Even after what… what he did?

790
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,920
Yes.

791
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,006
Because I knew I had failed him.

792
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,592
So this morning,

793
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,721
you said you believed
he was always alive in the darkness.

794
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,391
Is that why I was searching the darkness?

795
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,190
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

796
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,859
No. No.

797
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,779
We were focused on the Soviets.

798
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,780
You knew that.

799
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,949
"Papa does not tell the truth."

800
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,034
Henry said that.

801
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,787
And now you trust Henry?

802
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,999
Henry, who's manipulated you
like some puppet?

803
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,296
You are the one
who released him from his prison.

804
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,173
You.

805
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,344
And now you are angry with yourself

806
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,429
and you're taking your anger out on me

807
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,014
and you're risking everything.

808
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,098
No.

809
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,600
No, you.

810
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,937
<i>You </i>have risked everything!

811
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,063
<i>You </i>have lied!

812
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,565
<i>You</i> made me look for him!

813
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,321
The gate.

814
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,700
The Mind Flayer.

815
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,037
So many dead.

816
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,125
And all because of you.

817
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,876
Because you could not stop.

818
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,587
You could not let him go.

819
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,883
I came here
to try and understand who I was.

820
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,387
To see if I…

821
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,181
If I was the monster.

822
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,144
Papa!

823
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,981
And now I know the truth.

824
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,359
It is not me.

825
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,279
It is you.

826
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:18,906
You

827
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,451
are the monster.

828
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,497
I am going to open that door,

829
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,583
and I am going to leave

830
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,502
with Dr. Owens.

831
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,673
If you try to stop me, I will kill you.

832
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,337
You'll soon see the truth, Eleven.

833
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,974
Ah!

834
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,793
Is this legal?

835
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,673
Actually, I think it's a felony.

836
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,590
Right.

837
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,844
But it guarantees one thing.

838
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,139
I won't miss.

839
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,853
- How's she feeling?
- Light. But durable.

840
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,146
Deadly.

841
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,941
But reliable.

842
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,194
Hear me now.

843
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,823
There will be no more retreating…

844
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,243
…from Eddie the Banished.

845
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,579
Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle.

846
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,416
You get it?

847
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:36,793
"Bat-tle."

848
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,378
B-A-T.

849
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,466
No?

850
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,759
I thought I had a good one.

851
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,510
What are you doing?

852
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,909
You son of a bitch!

853
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,101
No wedgies! No wedgies!

854
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,810
Never change,

855
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,772
Dustin Henderson.

856
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,940
Promise me?

857
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,236
I wasn't planning on it.

858
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,113
Good.

859
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,408
- Good.
- Good.

860
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,951
Hey, Sinclairs.

861
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,205
How are those, uh… those spears coming on?

862
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,750
Flip that damn thumb around.

863
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,834
What?

864
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,297
It's too loose, Lucas.

865
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,799
This isn't a basketball game

866
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,510
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

867
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,095
Okay, okay, for the record,

868
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,722
my shoes never fell off.

869
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,265
Okay, for the record,

870
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,352
it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off
when you're riding the bench.

871
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,312
Yet, for some reason,

872
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,939
you show up to every game.

873
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,941
Mmm, except the one that mattered.

874
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,692
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.

875
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,654
Bull. Mom and Dad
can't force you to do shit.

876
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,448
Well, even though
you're a bench-riding loser,

877
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,866
you're still my brother.

878
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,367
Just the facts.

879
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,183
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

880
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,669
That was Dan Shelter.
He graduated, like, two years ago.

881
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,796
- So?
- So he's in college.

882
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,881
Which means he was visiting
on spring break.

883
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,218
<i>Fast Times</i> was returned,
like, I don't know, a week ago?

884
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:10,096
Right? Unless she's got
some horn dog brother we don't know about.

885
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,931
Which is possible.

886
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,350
Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?

887
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,309
- Steve.
- Nah.

888
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,270
- What?
- I don't care.

889
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,040
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

890
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,901
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time
for that little pull of the rug because…

891
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,405
In the face of the world ending,
the stakes of my love life

892
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,198
feel spectacularly low.

893
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,743
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,

894
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,413
but… I still have hope.

895
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,294
- Not everything has a happy ending.
- Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.

896
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,093
I'm not talking about failed romance.

897
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,052
I just…

898
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,222
I have this terrible,

899
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,309
gnawing feeling that…

900
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,063
It might not work out for us this time.

901
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,191
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

902
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,321
I think we're mad fools,
the lot of us, but…

903
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,825
…but if we don't stop him,
who will?

904
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,374
We have to try, right?

905
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,129
Yeah.

906
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,384
To killing Vecna.

907
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,097
Slash Henry.

908
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,392
Slash One.

909
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,536
It's only a precaution, Eleven.

910
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,540
I never intend to activate it.

911
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,295
I very much hope

912
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,006
our fighting has come to an end.

913
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,431
Shh.

914
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,517
Shh.

915
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,395
I know.

916
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,896
You're angry with me.

917
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,441
But it was the only way.

918
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,071
The best way.

919
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,916
- What's going on?
- It's Sullivan.

920
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,710
They found us.

921
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:56,804
Go, go, go!

922
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,957
Three! Two! One!

923
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,010
- Go to the back!
- Get moving!

924
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,178
- Move out!
- Go!

925
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,888
- Get 'em out of here!
- No more time!

926
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,014
Evacuate now!

927
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:02,495
Move!

928
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,288
Steady! Fire!

929
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,929
Eleven, we have to go.

930
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,932
- What is happening?
- They've come to kill you.

931
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,567
<i>Evacuate immediately.
Please proceed…</i>

932
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,246
- Clear.
- Clear!

933
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,416
Quarter and search by twos.
Hicks, take the upper level.

934
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Yes, sir.

935
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:10,436
Sir?

936
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,357
We found something you're gonna wanna see.

937
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,405
Well, well.

938
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,158
And what happened here?

939
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,658
Hmm?

940
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,620
Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?

941
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,038
Okay.

942
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,420
Let's try this again, shall we?

943
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,966
Where's the girl?

944
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:09,872
Where do you think you're going, Doc?

945
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,174
- Why don't you give 'em some lead?
- I got it.

946
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,483
Down he goes.

947
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,468
Victor-Two-Sierra,
this is Charlie-Lima-Golf.

948
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,886
Do you copy, over?

949
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,889
Victor-Two-Sierra, I copy, over.

950
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,683
<i>We've got the target in our sights.</i>

951
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,977
<i>Requesting permission
to take the shot, over.</i>

952
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,105
Jack, you don't have to do this.

953
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,189
It's over, Sam.

954
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,858
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can put her in a coma.

955
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,236
A medically induced coma.

956
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,446
We have the drugs.
We can do it right here.

957
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,616
And we'll see
if… if these murders keep happening.

958
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,744
If you're right, the killing ends,
and you can pull the plug on her.

959
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,162
In fact, I'll do it myself.

960
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,081
But if you're wrong about this,

961
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,292
God, are we gonna need her.

962
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:37,875
Jack.

963
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,004
Don't do this.

964
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,755
I'm begging you.

965
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:49,930
Take it.

966
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,265
You son of a bitch!

967
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,517
No! You son of a bitch!

968
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,644
Green light. Light her up.

969
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:01,942
Civvies. Five o'clock.

970
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,946
The hell?

971
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,032
- There she is! There she is!
- Where?

972
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,035
- On the ground!
- What are those dudes doing on the ground?

973
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,578
- Is that blood, man?
- Shit.

974
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,541
Victor-Two-Sierra,
we've got a civvy headed our way.

975
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:20,169
Ignore it. Just take out the girl.

976
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,546
Copy that.
Ignore the civvy. Take the shot.

977
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,179
Found ya.

978
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,731
- Hell are you doing? Hold her steady!
- I don't know, man. Something's wrong!

979
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,319
Jesus Christ.

980
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,122
Holy shit!

981
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,457
Shit!

982
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,384
I'm losing her!

983
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,014
Shit!

984
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:25,109
- Shit!
- Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!

985
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,336
Shit! Shit! Shit!

986
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,053
Eleven!

987
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,557
Eleven.

988
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,562
Oh, Mike.

989
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:52,863
It's really you?

990
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,572
It's me.

991
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:57,826
- I'm here.
- Okay.

992
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,661
Everyone's here.

993
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,302
Shit. Shit. Shit.

994
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:16,886
Oh shit.

995
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,765
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shit!

996
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:21,683
Eleven.

997
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:24,186
You… Are you okay?

998
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,813
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

999
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,317
Hey, guys. We gotta go.

1000
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,778
We gotta get you outta here.

1001
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,245
Papa.

1002
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:25,788
Eleven.

1003
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,255
I want you to know

1004
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,339
I'm proud of you.

1005
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:37,968
So very proud.

1006
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,513
You

1007
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,433
are my family.

1008
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,230
My child.

1009
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:03,827
I've only ever

1010
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,912
wanted to help you.

1011
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,915
To protect you.

1012
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,463
Everything I did,

1013
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,132
I did for you.

1014
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,762
I need you to understand.

1015
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,974
Please tell me you understand.

1016
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,616
Please.

1017
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,652
Goodbye, Papa.

1018
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,909
- We need to get to Hawkins.
- I know. And we will.

1019
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,552
But we need to get you somewhere safe.
Gonna be people behind us.

1020
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,413
No, Mike,
we need to get to Hawkins tonight.

1021
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,707
We'll never make it.
That's over 2,000 miles.

1022
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,000
We need to find a way.

1023
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,211
If we don't, they are going to die.

1024
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:00,962
Who's gonna die?

1025
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:04,299
El, who's gonna die?
