1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,640
- Is this your new girlfriend?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,280
You and I dating
would be totally weird.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,360
Totally weird.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
Wow, that's beautiful.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Step away from the creature, miss.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,680
You murdered him!

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,040
Hank is running some secret project.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,920
He's not just taking the fugitives.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,240
He's testing on them.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,560
I don't need you anymore.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,480
I don't need you anymore, either.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,480
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,520
Maybe I shouldn't intrude.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,360
Nate needs all of our support
right now.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,880
Well, what am I supposed
to say to him?

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,560
"Sorry the woman I've been exchanging
love letters with in prison

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
killed your dad"?

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
They ought to put that
on a condolence card.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,560
Look, we are going inside
and we are going to strive with grace

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,760
to help our friend cope
with his loss.

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Damn it.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,920
Here, let me help.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, thanks for sticking around
this past week.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
What are pretend girlfriends for?

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,760
My mom's going to be so crushed
when I tell her we broke up.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Then don't.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,920
I mean, she's going through a lot.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
We can pretend break up
any time we want.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,640
We should... we should probably
get out there.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
You ready for this?

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,360
Oh, Nathaniel.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,440
I need you to make a toast later.

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,560
Tell everyone what an amazing man
your father was.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,840
Yeah, Mom,
I don't think that's a great idea.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,440
What? Of course, it is.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,560
And Zari, I am so glad
that you're here for Nathaniel

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,800
to lean on right now.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,480
Yeah, you know me,
I'm... I'm his rock.

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,880
I can't... I can't face him.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Wait... wait.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I hope you're not stress-eating,
squire.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
I don't know what else to do.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
I can't believe this is happening.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,240
You feel the energy in this room?

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,240
It's like sitting on a keg
of dynamite.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
You see,
wakes are notorious soft spots

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
where the supernatural meets
the living world.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
See Nate's aunt?

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
That particular prayer
is to ward off evil spirits

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,320
and they've covered the mirrors,
so the bad lads can't get in.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Well, that's creepy.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
Yeah, well, creepy is my business.

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,200
And it looks like business is good.

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,040
Nate, Nate, I'm... I'm sorry.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
I'm... I'm so sorry.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,800
No, it's... it's okay, Ray.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,680
No, no, no, it's not.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,600
I keep giving Nora second chances
and she goes and does this.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Look, you thought Nora
could change and...

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,560
I never thought my dad
would be torturing magical creatures

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
so I guess...

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,360
I guess we're both wrong.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Can't believe
you're the one comforting me.

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,080
Oh, come on. I love you, bro.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
That's never going to change.

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Love you, too.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Oh, no.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Don't, no, no, no, don't.

70
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Don't, don't, don't do it, Ray.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Don't... you're going to do it.

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,960
You're going to do it.

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Nora?

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
How... how are you doing this?

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
It's a reflection spell.

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,840
I can't hold it much longer.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Well, good, because there's nothing
you could possibly say

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
that would make any difference.

79
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,040
This time there will be no more
second chances.

80
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Ray! I didn't kill Nate's dad.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,640
Oh, thank God, you're innocent.

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,800
Tell me where you are,
I need to talk to you in person.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
Now, who wants a nice, juicy steak?

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,600
{\an5}Charlie,
you know that I'm a vegetarian.

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
No, no, no,
you used to be a vegetarian

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
when you were a normal, boring human.

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,480
- But now you are...
- A monster?

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,400
Exactly. I mean, how cool is that?

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,640
{\an5}Wait, are you trying to get me
to shift into Wolfie?

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Of course, I am.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,560
{\an5}You've been moping about the ship,
thinking about your lost love.

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,400
{\an5}I think that he would really want you
to just embrace your wild side.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
Konane liked me as Mona.

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Elizabeth & Jane & Emma

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,280
The words on your shirt.

96
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,040
{\an5}These are the names of my favorite
Jane Austen characters.

97
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,920
<i>It appears that you're experiencing
the impact of a magical fugitive.</i>

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
This better be good, Mona.

99
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
A fugitive got to Jane Austen.

100
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,480
{\an5}She never wrote
"Sense and Sensibility."

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,400
And "Pride and Prejudice"
disappeared, too.

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Whatever it is,
it's going to have to wait.

103
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,520
Did someone say history's in trouble?

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,280
Legends assemble!

105
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,640
Okay, I really need
to get out of here, too.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Hey, what's up?

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Nothing.

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
There's a fugitive alert,
but it can wait.

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
No, you should go.

110
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,080
It's hard enough
I have to play pretend.

111
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
You guys shouldn't.

112
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Okay.

113
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,360
- Bye, Nate.
- Bye, Zari.

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,960
{\an5}Gideon traced a new Fugitive
to a wedding Jane Austen attended

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
{\an5}in Bath, England, 1802.

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,160
I already had Gideon chart a course.

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Can I come on the mission?

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Please?

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
Sure.

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
{\an5}Yeah, and as much as I love
a good wedding sneak

121
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
I'm going to QB from...

122
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
from my bedroom.

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,560
Is he acting weirder than normal?

124
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

125
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,960
Speaking of weird...

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,360
{\an5}I think my sense of smell
has improved because of Wolfie.

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,880
And you smell exactly like...

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Nate.

129
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,760
No, I don't.

130
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
It's definitely Nate.

131
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,080
Nate and something else.

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
Arousal?

133
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,360
No, I don't... don't like Nate.

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,920
- That would be wrong and...
- He likes you.

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
{\an5}He confessed it
when he swallowed the truth bug.

136
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
We're so not passing
the Bechdel Test right now.

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,560
It's okay to talk
about guys sometimes.

138
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,840
{\an5}Come on. I bet it's been months
since you got laid.

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Now, why don't you
just go smash Nate?

140
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,360
Or better yet,
you should go smash somebody else

141
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
{\an5}because if you're still thinking
about Nate

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,560
then you know you're really into him.

143
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,240
Why don't you talk to Nate?

144
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Tell him how you feel.

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,400
- Oh, boo.
- That is a terrible idea.

146
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
Okay, I'm going. Bye.

147
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,200
{\an5}This is like a Jane Austen novel
come to life.

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh, my bonnet!

149
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Look out!

150
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,760
Forgive me, miss.

151
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,880
Are you hurt?

152
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,520
Only my pride.

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,080
Injured pride is a small thing...

154
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,080
if it allowed us to meet.

155
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
What's the holdup there?

156
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,680
Come, come, I say.

157
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
Duty calls.

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Apologies, Lord Remington.

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
We'll be on our way shortly.

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Here.

161
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Not a word.

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,200
Was that a curtsey?

163
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
"Only my pride."

164
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
Okay, let's go. Shut up.

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
A damsel.

166
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,280
If you don't jump
that buff coachman's bones, I will.

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,880
We are at this wedding
to catch a magical creature.

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,840
If that's the groom,
then I'm glad I'm not the bride.

169
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
A man's charms
are equal to his fortunes.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
And Mr. Dockerty's fortunes
are prodigious.

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Jane.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
Don't be rude.

173
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
That's Jane Austen.

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
I cannot marry you, Mr. Dockerty.

175
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,800
My heart yearns for another.

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
Our family's scullery maid.

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,360
Ellen, are you here?

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm here!

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,200
I love you too!

180
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,920
Scandal!

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,520
Holy Lord!

182
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,160
I give not one fig, Ms. Sinclair

183
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,880
for my heart,
and my lower extremities

184
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,800
yearn for your mother.

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,200
Get over here, gorgeous.

186
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Come here, my love.

187
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Now this is what I call a wedding.

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Coast is clear.

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
I really don't want you
to get in trouble with your friends.

190
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh, it's no trouble.

191
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,320
It looks like everyone else
is still on mission.

192
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay.

193
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,240
So, who did kill Hank?

194
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,640
- The demon.
- Okay, good.

195
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,400
I... obviously,
I mean, obviously, it's bad.

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
If it's a demon, that means that John
will be able to find proof

197
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,400
and you just need to lay low
until he comes back.

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,320
You really don't mind me
staying here?

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Yeah, no, it'd be nice
if you stayed here.

200
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,720
Oy, Rayge.

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,840
Where are you?

202
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
I've got an update on the mission,
it's me to see a result...

203
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
- "Rayge"?
- It's a long story.

204
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,840
- need to do some research...
- What's...

205
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
What...

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
What are you hiding in there?

207
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
What? Nothing.

208
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
Buffing the old bishop, was we?

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
It's all right, mate.

210
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
No judgment here, all right?

211
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
- Come on.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,520
So, the bride and the scullery maid,
that was...

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,480
- Insane?
- Romantic

214
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
I was gonna say hot.

215
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Regardless, that definitely
did not happen in actual history.

216
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
Ray, Charlie, what you got?

217
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,760
This wedding
was the second of a series

218
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,120
of lust outbreaks in 1802.

219
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,360
Yeah, the sexual revolution came
a couple hundred years too early.

220
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
Why would it make
Jane Austen stop writing?

221
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
We need more info.

222
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,520
Well, Jane Austen was known
for being a keen social observer

223
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,920
so if anyone would have noticed
a new magical arrival in town

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
it would be her.

225
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
Okay, let's go interview Jane.

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
<i>Oh, wait, hang on a tick.</i>

227
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,200
People with the real dirt,
always the servants.

228
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,480
Like a handsome coachman perhaps?

229
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,040
Fine, I'll go ask him some questions,
but that's it.

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
- You go get it, girl.
- Okay.

231
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,480
Sister, dear, this is Ms. Lance
and Ms. Wu.

232
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
They're new in town.

233
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,840
Try not to scare them away.

234
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I shall do my best, Cassandra.

235
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
We are so sorry

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,560
to interrupt your writing,
Ms. Austen.

237
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
This? Just a letter.

238
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,200
Shall we take a turn around the room
while we converse?

239
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
We'd be delighted to.

240
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,960
It's a Regency thing. Go with it.

241
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,040
So, the bride, Ms. Sinclair

242
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
her behavior
must have been quite a shock.

243
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,160
Ever since Lord Remington arrived
a week ago,

244
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,440
the entire town
has been acting most imprudently.

245
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,240
But Ms. Sinclair's situation
is truly horrendous.

246
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,320
Oh, I'd think you, of all people

247
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,200
would celebrate the triumph
of romance.

248
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
What's to celebrate?

249
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Ms. Sinclair will be cut off
from her fortune

250
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,280
and the two women
will have nothing to live on.

251
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,640
But it's because of you... I mean...

252
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,600
I have come to believe
that love will find a way

253
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,880
to overcome any obstacle.

254
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,880
Then you're either lying
or you're a fool.

255
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Tell me, has love worked out
so well for you?

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,920
- No, but...
- Then you are a fool.

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,760
For you shouldn't have
to learn a lesson twice.

258
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
Let's go find Lord Remington.

259
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
We should be going.

260
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Hello?

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,600
This is stupid.

262
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,760
What a pleasure to see you again.

263
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Hey, man.

264
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
What's up, pretty?

265
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,400
This whole toasting
is eating me up on the inside.

266
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,880
My... my dad was such a dick.

267
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
He lied about everything

268
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
and now he's turning me
into a liar, too.

269
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,160
Listen, your old man's gone.

270
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,320
Whatever you say out there,
that's for you.

271
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
You know what, Mick?

272
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
I think you're onto something.

273
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Nathaniel!

274
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
Hey, where's Nate?

275
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Well, we need to find him
because Hank's spirit is still here.

276
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,480
Hey, cheer up.

277
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,120
I mean, what does Jane Austen know?

278
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
How to be witty,
wise and mix satire with romance.

279
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I bet you these girls know
where Lord Remington is.

280
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
They do look like fan girls.

281
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, you know the era.

282
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
You take the lead.

283
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,440
He's simply the handsomest man
I've ever laid eyes on.

284
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
I know what you mean.

285
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Lord Remington
is such a fine specimen.

286
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,760
I can't say I share your sentiment.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,680
His coachman, though,
what he lacks in means

288
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,600
he makes up for in magnetism.

289
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
I concur.

290
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,720
His arrival
has sent many hearts aflutter.

291
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,600
Coachman,
as in the guy we pushed Zari

292
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
to hook up with.

293
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Zari's going to smash the fugitive.

294
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,320
Oh, God!

295
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,840
Sorry, this is moving really fast.

296
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I agree.

297
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
You do?

298
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,960
What's your name?

299
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
My name is Zari, what's your name?

300
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
You know what?
Don't... don't answer that.

301
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,920
You don't kiss
like any man I've ever known.

302
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
What are you?

303
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,120
I am Kamadeva.

304
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
The Hindu God of love.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Awesome.

306
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
We're too late!

307
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Zari!

308
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,800
We think you might be dealing with...

309
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,320
The fugitive?

310
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Yeah, I know.

311
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,720
This is Kamadeva.

312
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,720
As in, namesake of the Kama Sutra,
Kamadeva?

313
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,720
That, I did not know.

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,680
Look, I'm not going to sleep
with a magical fugitive.

315
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,520
You are incredible.

316
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,680
A woman has never before
resisted my charms.

317
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
All right, you're coming with us.

318
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,840
I would follow Ms. Zari
to the world's end.

319
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,840
Well, your days
of ruining Regency-era marriages

320
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,400
are over, Kamadeva.

321
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,920
I only sought
to grant people the courage

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,120
to follow their heart's desire.

323
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,720
Oh, think he likes you.

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,560
Gideon, get us out of here.

325
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,160
I'm not so sure we can go yet.

326
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
<i>Ms. Wu is correct.</i>

327
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
<i>The historical records still indicate</i>

328
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,520
<i>that Jane Austen's career
is in jeopardy.</i>

329
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
We caught the fugitive,
what's the problem?

330
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,720
Well, it's too late to knock
on Jane Austen's door tonight.

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
We'll talk to her tomorrow.

332
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,320
So, I'm to spend the night...

333
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Alone.

334
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,080
Oh, what a waste.

335
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
All right, everybody out.

336
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
- Hi.
- Come on.

337
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Surely I can have a bed.

338
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
Well, I had Gideon fabricate
some jim-jams

339
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,800
because, you know,
it's a slumber party.

340
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Thanks.

341
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,280
Obviously, since you're my guest,
you will get the bed.

342
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
Oh, well, it's big enough
for the both of us.

343
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,320
We can just share.

344
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,760
Oh, okay.

345
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,280
You can turn around now.

346
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,440
It really covers everything.

347
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
Thing is, I pride myself
on being a gentleman

348
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,960
and the gentlemanly thing to do
would be to sleep in the chair, so...

349
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,800
But you... you... you can't...
there's no way you...

350
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,960
That's not...

351
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Okay.

352
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Hey, Nate.

353
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
How's the old toast going?

354
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
Is there one or two N's
in "conniving"?

355
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
Right, then.

356
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,040
May I suggest
a slight change of plan?

357
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,280
No, Mick is right.

358
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,520
It's time for me
to tell the truth about my dad.

359
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,000
How was I supposed to know
Hank's ghost was here?

360
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,360
That's about the gist of it,
Natey boy.

362
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,760
You see, your old man's spirit
is working very hard

363
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,520
to stay attached to the mortal realm.

364
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
I can only surmise
that he has something he wants

365
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
to say to you,
so if you wouldn't mind leaving off

366
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,600
your roast for a bit,
joining us for a brief séance

367
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,760
and I'll have him on his way
in no time.

368
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
No.

369
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
There's nothing Hank can say now

370
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,560
to excuse him from embezzling money
and hurting creatures.

371
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,680
In fact, I'm glad he's still here,

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,080
because it's his turn
to listen to me.

373
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
You don't scare me, Hank!

374
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Ray?

375
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,120
You want me in bed with you?

376
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
Yes, I did.

377
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I do.

378
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I do.

379
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Is this okay?

380
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Yes.

381
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,840
Ava.

382
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Damn it, this is definitely a dream.

383
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,040
The fugitive get to you, too?

384
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah.

385
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,760
Well, personally,
I really enjoyed my night,

386
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,600
blowing David Bowie's mind.

387
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,120
Who'd you get a leg over, Z?

388
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,480
Wait, let me guess, Nate?

389
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,960
No, Kamadeva.

390
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Both?

391
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
It was both! Blimey, Z, I didn't know
you had it in you.

392
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,200
What about you, Wolfie?

393
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,280
You dreamt about Konane.

394
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Mona.

395
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I'll get it.

396
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
Hey, hey, hey.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's okay.

398
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,960
He had the sweetest eyes.

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,600
And when he would look at me,
the whole world would disappear.

400
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,960
And now he's dead.

401
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,200
Mona, I know it's hard,
but try to have some perspective.

402
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,080
You didn't know him for very long.

403
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,280
So, you think I'm a fool, too?

404
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,520
No, I just don't think anyone
should give their heart away

405
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,360
without thinking about
the consequences.

406
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,280
But romance is taking a chance
on someone without knowing

407
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,600
how it's going to end up!

408
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,880
Romance is something used
to sell novels.

409
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,240
- It's not real.
- Well, it'll never be real for you.

410
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,320
Not if you never try.
Not if you never take a risk!

411
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,640
You know, it's hard to take advice
from someone whose boyfriend

412
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
turned her into a werewolf.

413
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
Hey, guys.

414
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,760
Let's just take a breath.

415
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
You're right.

416
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,160
I might be stupid for being
a romantic,

417
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,080
but it's not Konane's fault.

418
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Bloody hell!

419
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,160
Finally! You look wicked, mate!

420
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,760
Mona, wait!

421
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,160
Jane Austen.

422
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,280
It's time for you to pay!

423
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,320
Stay back, beast!

424
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,600
If I'm a beast, it's because of you!

425
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,240
Your books made me
an incurable romantic!

426
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,080
You're the reason I risked everything
for love!

427
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
And now Konane's dead!

428
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,480
And look at me!

429
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,880
You don't believe in romance!
Your writing is all lies!

430
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,280
Are you the girl from earlier?

431
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Mona is weak.

432
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,800
Wolfie is strong.

433
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,480
Well, Wolfie, I believe
from the depths of my soul

434
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,080
that one should only marry for love.

435
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,600
- You do?
- So much so,

436
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,640
that I rejected the only man
who has ever asked for my hand.

437
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,800
He was a smug simpleton
who only read sermons.

438
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,440
How remarkable.

439
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,200
You shouldn't mess
with people's dreams.

440
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,560
My powers don't create passion
out of thin air.

441
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,920
Whomever you dreamt about,
you truly desire.

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,560
It doesn't mean I have to act on it.
It's called impulse control.

443
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,960
You sound like a woman

444
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,320
who has never let herself
fall in love.

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Where I'm from, love is a liability.

446
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,320
And yet a life without love
is no life at all.

447
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,000
Tell me, what does a God know
about the human heart?

448
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,000
My real name is Sunjay.

449
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I was born thousands of years ago.

450
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,800
When the actual Kamadeva
was immolated by Shiva,

451
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,480
I gathered his ashes in this vial.

452
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,680
They bestowed powers
I could have scarcely imagined.

453
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,920
Why are you telling me this?

454
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,560
Because I like you.

455
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,880
And I think you secretly yearn
to be impulsive and free.

456
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,800
Unless you lack the courage.

457
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Okay.

458
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,920
- Give me a hit.
- Might I suggest...

459
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,120
Nope. If I'm going to do this,
I want to experience love, lust,

460
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
the whole shebang.

461
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,400
That is, unless you lack the courage.

462
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,760
One, two, three.

463
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,080
Most of you here, knew Hank well.

464
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,560
Or, thought you did.

465
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm going to talk about
a different Hank,

466
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,040
a Hank I got to know this year.

467
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,920
Hank was a workaholic
who never took a day off.

468
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, Hank, you can,

469
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,440
finally rest in peace.

470
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,680
Hank never knew his own father.

471
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,000
That's why he wanted to be there
for Nathaniel growing up.

472
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,720
But work often got in the way.

473
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,440
So one year,

474
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,040
we planned to use Hank's leave
to stay for a week in Disney World.

475
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,040
Nathaniel was over the moon.

476
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,720
But the morning that we were to fly
to Orlando, we...

477
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,880
ended up having to take Nathaniel
to the hospital instead.

478
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,040
When Hank saw the look
of disappointment in his son's eyes,

479
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,600
he went out and rented
a Mickey Mouse costume,

480
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,280
put it on and went to the hospital.

481
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,760
He convinced everyone there

482
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,440
that Mickey Mouse had come
to see them.

483
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,920
Hank Heywood was not a perfect man.

484
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,000
But when he was at his best,
that is who he was,

485
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,280
a man who could make you believe
in magic.

486
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
To Hank.

487
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,840
- To Hank.
- To Hank.

488
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Why did you tell me that by following
their hearts,

489
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,640
those women would only fall
into despair?

490
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,840
Because my decision was a result
of my pride.

491
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,360
When my father dies, my sister
and I will be reduced to penury.

492
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,640
- But your writing...
- Has been rejected

493
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
by every publisher.

494
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,680
It's no wonder.

495
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,640
I satirize the manners of a society
that seems to have lost

496
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
all sense of decorum.

497
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,040
Therefore,
I've decided to stop writing.

498
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,520
But you will publish.

499
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,720
You can't give up now,
because your books are timeless.

500
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
How can you be so sure?

501
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Because...

502
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,920
you're my favorite author.

503
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,520
May I offer you a bit of advice?

504
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,280
My books advocate a partnership
based on love and mutual respect,

505
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,560
not on losing control.

506
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,440
What shall we do next?

507
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
I have an idea.

508
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,040
Let's get married.

509
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Do you hear that?

510
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,640
No. Hear what?

511
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
There's definitely music playing.

512
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Kamadeva loved music.

513
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,560
Perhaps you should sing.

514
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I don't sing.

515
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,840
<i>Every day I find a way</i>

516
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,480
<i>To shove my past and anger down</i>

517
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Go on, my love.

518
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,240
That was beautiful.

519
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,640
<i>My humor's dry I never cry</i>

520
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,840
<i>If I start I'd surely drown</i>

521
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,160
<i>When I'm on my own I can't help
Wanting something more</i>

522
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,360
<i>Today instead of closing off
I'm opening a door</i>

523
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,960
<i>- Now I'm tossing sense aside
- Now I'm tossing sense aside</i>

524
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,080
<i>- And I surrender
- And I surrender</i>

525
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,720
<i>- To the fantasy and pleasure
- To the fantasy and pleasure</i>

526

<i>- I won't fight it

529
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,960
<i>- Won't deny it

530
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,000
<i>- Do you have a ring? I'll try it
- Do you have a ring? I'll try it</i>

531
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,160
<i>- I surrender
- I surrender</i>

532
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,760
In the morning we should go ask
the parson to marry us.

533
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,480
A Christian wedding?

534
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,520
For a Muslim woman and a Hindu man?

535
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Let's not think with our heads,
but feel with our hearts.

536
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,240
Gideon, where's that music
coming from?

537
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,160
<i>I took the liberty of broadcasting
Ms. Tomaz's comms.</i>

538
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,040
Rather infectious.

539
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,480
Ray, this music,

540
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,640
- I think it's magical.
- You're right.

541
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I want to express my feelings to you
in verse.

542
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
Is that really necessary?

543
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,760
I had a dirty dream of you.

544
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll bet mine was dirtier.

545
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,000
Why didn't you go and make a move?

546
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,040
I would have, if you'd been flirtier.

547
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
Okay. It's just complicated.

548
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,760
If Nate knew, he'd be enraged.

549
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,160
I know and I'm sorry,
but my desire's been uncaged.

550
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,080
Don't let this moment pass us by.
It could be our only chance.

551
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,720
You're right. I need you now.

552
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,160
Sorry, Nate and Captain Lance.

553
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,600
<i>I fixed the timeline as a cat

554
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,080

<i>Never thought I'd play the fool</i>

557
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,280
<i>Now I've surrendered to you</i>

558
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,720
<i>It's time for me to say I do</i>

559
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,080
"I do"? What are you talking about?

560
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,520
We need to find Mona.

561
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,920
Wait a sec, is this
a Bollywood musical number?

562
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,040
You bet your ass, it is.

563
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,160
<i>Now we're tossing sense aside
And we surrender</i>

564

<i>To the fantasy

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
<i>We surrender</i>

568
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,040
<i>I want you badly as my bride
Please make my wish come true</i>

569
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,640
<i>These feelings can't be denied
So yes I say I...</i>

570
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Stop!

571
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,440
You're making a mistake!

572
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,000
<i>Zari</i>

573
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,480
Whoa, why did I just sing that?

574
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,400
Okay, I guess I'm just going to roll
with the whole singing thing.

575

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,280
<i>To wait for something more</i>

581
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Don't listen to her, my love.

582
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,040
No, Mona's right, Z,
you don't even know this guy.

583
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,160
He's been using the powers
of a Love God for years,

584
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,560
guaranteed he's got a wife.

585
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,600
- Is that true?
- Not exactly.

586
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
I have 1000 wives.

587
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
But lucky number 1001
is the most important.

588
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
Seriously?

589
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,200
So, you still want to marry me?

590
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,240
No, I definitely do not.

591
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,560

597
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,720
Voi-bloody-la.

598
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,600
Now, only the particular spirit
we're after will be able to enter

599
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
the vessel.

600
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,960
What vessel?

601
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,600
The vessel's you.

602
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm going to kill you, weasel.

603
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,400
(Foreign language)

604
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,000
Hank Heywood,

605
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,480
I summon you.

606
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,760
(Foreign language)

607
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Hank?

608
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
Who else would it be?

609
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,000
Where's Nathaniel?

610
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,480
Oh, old Nate gave you
the big middle finger,

611
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,200
so I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

612
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Still angry, is he?

613
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Us Heywoods, we hold a good grudge.

614
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,640
Now what's so important that you had
to stick around?

615
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,840
It pains me to admit it but I made
a terrible mistake.

616
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,400
A man approached me about a deal.

617
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
Unlimited funding...

618
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,280
and all I had to do
was give him access

619
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,400
to all the magical creatures
within the Time Bureau.

620
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,920
But this man was no ordinary
beltway bandit,

621
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,120
he was a demon.

622
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,440
Disneyland

623
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,760
Only after he murdered me,
did I realize the truth.

624
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,720
What was the demon's name?

625
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
Promise me you'll keep
Nathaniel safe.

626
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Yes, yes, yes. I promise.

627
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,280
Now, come on, Hank, you can't delay
the inevitable forever.

628
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,120
What was the demon's name?

629
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
His name...

630
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,440
was Neron.

631
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,440
<i>Hey, world!</i>

632
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,720

634
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,240
<i>When I learned about the existence
of magical creatures, yes!</i>

635
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,200
<i>Magical creatures exist!</i>

636
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,600
<i>I ran right home, pulled out
a drawing made by my son, Nathaniel,</i>

637
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,760
<i>when he was only 9 years old.</i>

638
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>My son envisioned a theme park</i>

639
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>where everyone could gaze in wonder
at dragons and unicorns,</i>

640
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,120
<i>werewolves and minotaurs.</i>

641
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
This is insane.

642
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,640
<i>Now, you may be thinking,
"This is insane."</i>

643
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,320
<i>But what great man
hasn't been thought</i>

644
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,560
<i>of as insane at one point
in his life?</i>

645
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,360
<i>I believe this park can bring
our country together.</i>

646
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,720
<i>And with your help, I'm going to turn
my son's dream into a reality.</i>

647
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,840
<i>I call it Heyworld.</i>

648
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Oh, Hank.

649
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Why?

650
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,400
Oh, Hank.

651
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,480
I have so many questions.

652
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
You weren't torturing
magical creatures.

653
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,480
You were training them
to be in a theme park.

654
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,200
That is nuts.

655
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
But I got to respect you
for dreaming big.

656
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,640
It was your moonshot,
your way of risking it all

657
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,520
to make the world a better place.

658
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,040
I was so wrong about you.

659
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,400
At the end of the day,
you were just as wacky

660
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,280
and well-intentioned as any legend.

661
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,200
And I wish I had a chance to get
to know that side of you.

662
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
I'm going to miss you.

663
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I love you, Hank.

664
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I love you, Dad.

665
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,240
Look at you.

666
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,800
Take a look at yourself,
you miserable git.

667
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
That's right.

668
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,160
Soak it in.

669
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,960
Your big sacrifice,
it was for nothing.

670
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,440
But instead of rolling up
your sleeves

671
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
and taking it to that demon bastard,

672
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,120
you're getting rat-ass drunk
in a shed.

673
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,200
I can't fight him.

674
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,600
He's too strong.

675
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,360
Oh, this isn't about Neron.

676
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,320
You failed Desmond.

677
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,840
You failed Astra.

678
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,360
And you'll fail Nate.
And you know why?

679
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,040
Because deep down,

680
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,600
you want them all to go to Hell.

681
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,840
You want the company.

682
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
You liar!

683
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,360
Hey, Johnny.

684
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,960
Miss me?

685
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Des.

686
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm surprised you haven't
figured it out yet.

687
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Neron.
