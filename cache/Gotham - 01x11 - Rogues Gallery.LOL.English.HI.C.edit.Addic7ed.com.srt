<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,961
I've been sober for a year.

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,564
That doesn't erase the things that
I did, but I still care about you.

4

In the meantime, each of your
tariffs will increase 25%.

8
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:21,334
Reach out to Saviano and Turski.

9
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,630
They are worried about
ending up like Bannion.

10

<i>The old man is herding his sheep toward me.</i>

11
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,534
Arrogant clown.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,633
Try to take me down?

13
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,363
You do not know where the edge is.

14

<i>Security guard for nut jobs?</i>

- It's that or quit.
- So quit.

17
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:36,060
That's what they want me to do.

"It will control my dam's god."

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,277

my dam's god Setebos

36
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:29,083

00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,520
So, slave, hence.

38
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,089

This is the fourth inmate
outburst in as many weeks

60
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,462
as you've been stationed here.

61
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:50,297
I understand this is

62
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,266
punishment duty for you,

63
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,835
but I expect professional
standards nonetheless.

64
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,470
This is unacceptable, Gordon.

65
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,172
Unacceptable.

66
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,174
It's my fault, Mr. Lang.

67
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,842
The play was too upsetting.

68
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,144
We'll stick to comedies from now on, I think.

69
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,479
LANG: Thank you, Nurse Duncan.

70
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:07,481
It's "Director" or "Dr. Lang,"

71
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,616
as you prefer.

72
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,484
Recreational activities

73
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,386
are not pertinent to this conversation.

74
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,855
Officer Gordon is responsible

75
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,558
for security on this wing,

76
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,494
a task which he seems unable to manage.

77
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,031
What have you to say about this, Gordon?

78
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,301
This man needs medical attention.

79
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,769
DUNCAN: I'd see to him myself,

80
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,237
but there's rules.

81
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,906
I dispense meds, not treatment.

82
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:34,141
He needs a doctor.

83
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,143
Very well.

84
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:39,213
I'll send one in.

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,050
Any more incidents,

86
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,653
and I'll have you placed
on the remedial duty roster.

87
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:49,323
Think you can't fall any farther?

88
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,358
Think again.

89
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,265
(door opens)

90
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,074
How is he?

91
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,877
(whimpers)

92
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,145
He's fine.

93
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,980
Will be.

94
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:14,682
And you?

95
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:15,683
I'm good.

96
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:17,451
Few bruises.

97
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:21,055
What?

98
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,389
You're the famous

99
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,191
Detective Jim Gordon, aren't you?

100
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,559
That's my name.

101
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,860
I'm not sure about "famous."

102
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,529
Notorious, then?

103
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:29,897
Nearer the mark.

104
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,065
Who are you?

105
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,367
Leslie Thompkins.

106
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:34,568
Dr. Thompkins.

107
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,105
You work here?

108
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,207
I'm not an inmate.

109
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,710
I haven't seen you on infirmary duty before.

110
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,078
I work in the female ward.

111
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:46,113
I come over here when they're short-handed.

112
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,483
All the girls are talking about you.

113
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,286
Brave detective brought low

114
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,721
by fighting City Hall.

115
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,456
Ah.

116
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,957
They say that, do they?

117
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
make light of your situation.

118
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,763
It's okay.

119
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:04,932
Personally, I think what
you're doing is admirable.

120
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:07,768
I'm guarding lunatics.

121
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,236
No. You're not quitting.

122
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:11,138
Not yet.

123
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,842
Who are you?

124
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:16,110
Oh, sorry.

125
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,611
I didn't mean to blurt
all that out like I did.

126
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:18,946
It's none of my business.

127
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,114
Uh, Dr. Thompkins,

128
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,850
you sure this inmate's gonna be okay?

129
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:24,385
He's fine.

130
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,819
He's just sleeping off his meds.

131
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:27,154
ROYSTON: I'm trying.

132
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,257
Get a room, you guys.

133
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,227
I should go.

134
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,428
It's nice to meet you, Jim.

135
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,163
Likewise.

136
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,170
(thunder rumbling)

137
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,205
(creaking)

138
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,643
(distant siren wailing)

139
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,851
(child coughing)

140
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,192
(coughing continues)

141
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:07,227
Ivy?

142
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:11,532
How you doing?

143
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,467
I... I'm good.

144
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:14,835
I'm good.

145
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,270
You look sick.

146
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,638
Like you need a doctor.

147
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:18,906
No doctors.

148
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:20,808
N... never, ever again.

149
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:23,444
I-I'm fine.

150
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,279
I-I was resting.

151
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,317
(Ivy coughing)

152
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,957
I got a place we can go, Ivy.

153
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,225
Come on.

154
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
I-I-I, I'm shivery is all.

155
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,796
(clattering)

156
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,131
(rats squeaking)

157
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,299
Okay.

158
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,301
(Ivy moans)

159
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:49,136
Come on.

160
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:04,818
(rain falling heavily)

161
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,398
(sniffs)

162
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,708
They're gone.

163
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:30,077
It's safe.

164
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,346
Sure?

165
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,681
Sure as sure.

166
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:37,384
We'll only stay until you feel better.

167
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,087
Come and lay down on the couch there.

168
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,390
Wh... What if the real people come home?

169
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:45,125
There's dust on everything

170
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,294
and something smells rotten.

171
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,563
Nobody's coming.

172
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:50,831
Whose place is this, anyways?

173
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,432
How come you ask so many questions, Ivy?

174
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,967
I'm trying to help you.

175
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:55,903
Now lie down and I'll get you a blanket.

176
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,647
(seagulls squawking)

177
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:12,386
OSWALD: Morning, gentlemen.

178
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,122
Have you considered my proposition?

179
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:16,390
Uh, yeah.

180
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,391
No.

181
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:18,659
No?

182
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:19,660
We already pay enough.

183
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,295
Don Maroni set the rates last year.

184
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,330
And now I'm raising the prices.

185
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,065
Inflation is a bitch.

186
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,667
Maroni said...

187
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,302
Maroni, Maroni...

188
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,903
You're beginning to irk me.

189
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,739
You're talking to me, the Penguin.

190
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,807
So you're Penguin.

191
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,108
So what?

192
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,543
I called the cops on you.

193
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,746
<i>It's The Penguin.</i>

194
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,515
And that was a very naive call to make.

195
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,783
(car doors closing)

196
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,885
Hello, we own the cops on the waterfront.

197
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,186
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

198
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,221
(indistinct radio transmission)

199
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,425
Boys.

200
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,793
Why the frowns?

201
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:58,098
(crow cawing)

202
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:13,347
Jones?

203
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,551
Jones.

204
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:30,697
Hey, Frogman.

205
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:36,436
Hey.

206
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,874
Hey.

207
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:53,681
<b>Sync and correction by caioalbanezi

208
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,722
THOMPKINS: These are electrode wounds.

209
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,556
This man was given a crude,

210
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:02,625
invasive kind of electroshock therapy.

211
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,694
Metal needles were inserted into the brain

212
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,329
and electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

213
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,697
What for?

214
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,899
Surgically, it's used to
modify aberrant behavior,

215
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,601
but in this case, way
too much voltage was used

216
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,503
and his brain is completely fried.

217
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,105
Another under your watch, Gordon?

218
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,440
How did this happen?

219
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,709
You rushed into opening,

220
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,377
and now you're running this place

221
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,413
with skeleton staff and zero surveillance

222
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,115
in an unsafe and unsecure
200-year-old maze.

223
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:28,084
Excellent. Excuses.

224
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,086
That's that nature of municipal operations.

225
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,655
You inherit problems

226
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,724
and you use the resources
at hand to do with you can.

227
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,926
Well, our resources don't
stretch nearly far enough

228
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:39,329
to cover a criminal assault investigation.

229
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,830
We should call the GCPD.

230
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:43,766
No, this is an in-house medical issue.

231
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,837
He still breathing?

232
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:50,006
Well, yes, but he's effectively brain dead.

233
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,107
What does...

234
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,375
He's still breathing.

235
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,977
Unaided.

236
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:55,511
For all official purposes, well,

237
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,114
he's still alive.

238
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,649
Keep him comfortable, Doctor.

239
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:02,986
Officer Gordon?

240
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,587
I want you to find out which one

241
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,956
of our charming inmates did this.

242
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:10,760
I want a report on my desk Friday.

243
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,565
(door opens)

244
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,801
(door closes)

245
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,771
Another day, another dollar.

246
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,773
Really? This is rather usual

247
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,241
and sinister, isn't it?

248
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:28,044
Yes.

249
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,246
So, who are we looking for?

250
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,482
What does it take to pull this off?

251
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,716
Uh...

252
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,752
some basic knowledge of human anatomy.

253
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,854
Um, basic electrical skills.

254
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,322
A circuit board,

255
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:40,356
some wiring.

256
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:41,491
Is that all?

257
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,292
And the door keys, of course.

258
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,827
"The door keys."

259
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,130
Right.

260
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,599
No, man, I got my keys right here.

261
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,200
Look at me, Steven.

262
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,602
Look at me.

263
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,139
Tell me the truth.

264
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,840
Why you picking on me?

265
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:59,742
There's five other guards
with keys to this wing.

266
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:01,344
True, and you're the only one who looks

267
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,979
and smells like a hunted animal.

268
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,415
Look, Steven.

269
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,383
Whoever fried Frogman had keys.

270
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,085
Now, we've searched all the inmates' cells.

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,820
No keys.

272
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,021
But I know they're out there.

273
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,790
And I need to know where.

274
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,825
I'm backed up against the wall here.

275
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,261
And I'm starting to lose my
patience... do you understand?

276
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:22,999
That fight... during the play.

277
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,101
Right after, I noticed my keys were gone.

278
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,804
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.

279
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,173
They dock me a week's pay,
so I tracked done a spare set!

280
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,307
Who took the keys?

281
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,408
I don't know.

282
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:33,810
Anyone could've taken them.

283
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:37,947
Walk away.

284
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,015
Sorry...

285
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,451
Walk away!

286
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,922
(siren wailing in distance)

287
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:48,024
<i>SAVIANO: And then he raises our taxes</i>

288
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,059
after his money blows up.

289
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:51,494
Killed Bannion like he was nobody.

290
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,029
I'll say it.

291
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,164
I wish something would
happen to old man Falcone

292
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
before he comes after one of us.

293
00:12:57,435 --> 00:12:58,868
That's where this is going.

294
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,837
Slow down. Now, let's imagine

295
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:02,905
God forbid anything happened to Falcone.

296
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,373
Just for kicks...

297
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,242
who would take over then?

298
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:07,410
Who would take over?

299
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,478
I do.

300
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,246
You?

301
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:13,149
Now, that never occurred to me.

302
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,884
What never occurred?

303
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,819
I'm next in line. Seniority.

304
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:18,988
That's the way the system works.

305
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:21,791
That's how the system used
to work back in the day.

306
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:23,426
It's a new dawn, a new city.

307
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:24,961
I would believe we would need

308
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:27,063
some fresh thinking at the top.

309
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,065
And who is the fresh
thinker that you got in mind?

310
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,399
Let me guess.

311
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,435
Who?

312
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,836
Her.

313
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:34,937
She's talking about her.

314
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,439
Oh. (laughs)

315
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:38,074
Really?

316
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,543
You don't think I could run the family?

317
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:41,811
Hey, no, why not?

318
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,379
Woman's lib and all that.

319
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:46,382
But fair play, Jimmy is next in line.

320
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:49,218
Well, there's no need to argue.

321
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,521
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.

322
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:54,757
We're just talking, right?

323
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,265
Inmate 5075 Jack Gruber.

324
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,301
Inmate Gruber?

325
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,070
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

326
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:11,240
You're looking into the
sad demise of the Frogman.

327
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:13,743
The Frogman disrupted your play last night.

328
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,144
Yeah.

329
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,113
You didn't like him very much, did you?

330
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,881
Well, I had no opinion of him.

331
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,883
He was called the Frogman because he believed

332
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,219
a giant bullfrog lived inside his abdomen,

333
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,921
controlling his thoughts.

334
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,957
He was already dead.

335
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,959
I don't waste psychic energy on the dead.

336
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,797
Rape, murder...

337
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,266
You're no stranger to violence, Gruber.

338
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,836
Your psych evals say
you're a grade-A sociopath.

339
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,272
Why should I take your word for anything?

340
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,942
You shouldn't believe
everything you read, Jim.

341
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:48,110
May I call you Jim?

342
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:49,845
Did you take the keys? Please,

343
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,847
search my cell if you do
not find me trustworthy,

344
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:57,153
but, no, Jim, I did not take anyone's keys.

345
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,958
Thank you.

346
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,459
Guard?

347
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:06,662
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

348
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,197
(crying)

349
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,498
No.

350
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,834
(loud grunting)

351
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:14,170
Hey. Hey!

352
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,440
(grunting)

353
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:18,774
Settle down.

354
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,009
(shouting)

355
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,844
- S-Settle down.
- ORDERLY: Settle down.

356
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,613
Did you take Off...

357
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,681
(laughing)

358
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,483
(chuckles)

359
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,885
You have the keys?

360
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,787
(chuckling)

361
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,392
(orderlies shouting)

362
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,395
Get the straps! Need a restraint!

363
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,497
- Keys?
- Yes.

364
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:44,233
Keys. Did you take the guard's keys?

365
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,069
No. Am I in trouble?

366
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,537
No, Aaron,

367
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,706
unless you're lying to me.

368
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,175
DUNCAN: Aaron never lies,

369
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,443
Mr. Gordon.

370
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,045
He doesn't have the concept,

371
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,414
poor peaceful soul that he is.

372
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,385
He killed his family with an axe.

373
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,820
Isn't that what you did, Aaron?

374
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,758
Never harmed a fly before or since.

375
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,728
I said sorry.

376
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,397
Okay, Aaron.

377
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,898
You're free to go.

378
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,434
Thank you. Guard?

379
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,404
(horn honking in distance)

380
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,439
(siren chirping)

381
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,409
(helicopter blades whirring)

382
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,444
(horns honking)

383
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:35,951
You saw how that went.

384
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,620
Saviano's the problem.

385
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:40,423
Now, on his own, Janacek,
I can turn him around.

386
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,425
And the junior capos will follow him.

387
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,294
But that Saviano, we got to deal with him

388
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,129
before we make our move on Maroni.

389
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,964
Why not let me talk to Saviano

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,734
on my own? Me and Jimmy go way back.

391
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,437
That's true. You do go way back.

392
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,139
What would you tell him?

393
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:58,908
I'd say you're the best candidate.

394
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,242
He knows that.

395
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:02,178
He just can't admit it to your face.

396
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,913
Too proud.

397
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:06,248
Okay then.

398
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,150
Talk to him.

399
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:09,485
Will do.

400
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,053
Butch,

401
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,556
you're not turning on me, are you?

402
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:14,957
Ho!

403
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,426
What kind of question is that?

404
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:19,662
Why would you even joke
about something like that?

405
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,664
I'm just asking.

406
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,101
A girl gets insecure once in a while.

407
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,136
(chuckles)

408
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,048
(whimpering)

409
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,363
(zapping) (muffled shouting)

410
00:17:57,902 --> 00:18:01,337
(screaming)

411
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:05,341
(metallic rattling in distance)

412
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,149
(rattling continues)

413
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:19,855
Royston, what are you doing out of your cell?

414
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,824
Hey, cut it out!

415
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,160
Full fathom five thy father lies.

416
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:27,163
Of his bones are coral made.

417
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:29,665
Aw, hell.

418
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:44,045
Royston, is that your name?

419
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,882
Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell.

420
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,383
Fascinating.

421
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,652
The poor man can walk and talk,
but all he remembers are lines

422
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:51,953
from the play.

423
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,288
Same electroshock technique

424
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,291
as Frogman but with slightly
less drastic results.

425
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,894
It's like whoever's doing this
is improving their methods.

426
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,896
Or maybe their process is
so haphazard, they don't know

427
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,165
what kind of outcome they're gonna get.

428
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,333
One man ends up a vegetable,

429
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,336
while the other one recites
Shakespeare on a loop.

430
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,106
I don't understand what an inmate gains

431
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,408
from scrambling up another inmate.

432
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,780
You should stay on the
female wing for a while.

433
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,582
There's no reason to put yourself in danger.

434
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,584
I'm perfectly capable of protecting myself.

435
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,419
Besides, my patients need me.

436
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,921
There's gonna be some drama around here.

437
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,155
The missing keys

438
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,423
made me focus on the inmates,

439
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,691
but I think it's a misdirection.

440
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,961
I think I should be focusing on the staff.

441
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:36,131
Oh. I see.

442
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,000
There will be some drama.

443
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,802
But, wait, I'm staff.

444
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,204
What if it's me?

445
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,939
- It's not you.
- How can you tell?

446
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,874
- You're not the type.
- Cop skills, huh?

447
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,443
You can read people.

448
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,779
Some people.

449
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:56,351
A staff member? That's absurd.

450
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,820
- It was an inmate.
- I don't think so.

451
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:00,822
Your job is to oversee inmate security.

452
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:02,991
You're not authorized to
conduct an investigation

453
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,192
of the staff.

454
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:07,796
Whoa. You're trying to force my hand.

455
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,464
You want me to call the police.

456
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,466
No.

457
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,402
I already called 'em.

458
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,940
(boat whistle blows in distance)

459
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,378
(exhales)

460
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:32,554
Barbara, you need to wake up.

461
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:36,725
Morning.

462
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,261
I got you coffee.

463
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:42,597
Mmm, extra sweet.

464
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,699
You always remember.

465
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,301
Yeah.

466
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:48,503
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

467
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,438
Why would I?

468
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,773
Renee, you don't

469
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,775
have to be jealous of Jim.

470
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,111
I'm over him.

471
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:59,547
This was a mistake.

472
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,516
What was?

473
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,585
This. Us.

474
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,287
I should have never let
it go on for this long.

475
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,689
I'm s... I'm sorry.

476
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,427
Oh, I-I see.

477
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,595
Look, Barbara...

478
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,264
No. No. I mean, you're...

479
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,334
No, you are absolutely right.
This-this was a mistake.

480
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,636
This has been a really long process for me,

481
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,372
and I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

482
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,410
I-I wanted this to be good,
but I can't fall back now.

483
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,478
The drinking, the drugs.

484
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,380
We're toxic together, you and me.

485
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,748
Please, Renee, stop.

486
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,250
There's no need to say another word.

487
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,252
I am sorry that I
interfered with your process.

488
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,486
Barbara, you need help

489
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:40,255
I can't give you right now. Let me call Jim

490
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,956
- for you, please.
- No.

491
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:44,893
- Where's my purse?
- You don't need to go. Stay here.

492
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,928
Take time to get yourself together. I'll go.

493
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,764
I am perfectly together, thank you.

494
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,766
I am just toxic, that's all.

495
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:53,201
Now, where's my damn purse?!

496
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,402
Barbara, stop.

497
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,770
Calm down, please, all right?

498
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:58,640
I'll go.

499
00:21:58,675 --> 00:21:59,741
Please.

500
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,744
Fine.

501
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,412
Do what you want. Go.

502
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,115
I'm sorry...

503
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,050
Just go.

504
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:32,340
Hey, pal.

505
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,843
In a cow slip's bell I lie,

506
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:38,179
there I crouch when owls do cry.

507
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,347
All right.

508
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:40,515
I can dig that.

509
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,650
(door opens)

510
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,345
Detective...

511
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:45,520
Jim! (laughs)

512
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:47,522
Partner. Mwah!

513
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,190
Let me take a good look at you.

514
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:51,359
Lord have mercy, a screw.

515
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:52,794
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

516
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,828
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.

517
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:56,631
Freaky as advertised.

518
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,466
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.

519
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,968
This is not a police matter.

520
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,803
You must be Director Dr. Lang.

521
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,271
See, I beg to differ.

522
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:08,042
This is third degree
assault, at the very least.

523
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:11,212
A friend of yours, is it?

524
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:13,047
Egregious insubordination.

525
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,316
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

526
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,485
This is the end of your
career in law enforcement.

527
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,987
Count on it. Whoa!

528
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,555
Take it easy, hot shot.

529
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,689
Officer Gordon did the right thing.

530
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:22,791
Why wouldn't he call the police?

531
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,025
Anyone would think you'd want

532
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,294
to keep this business quiet.

533
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:27,996
Gerry... it is Gerry, isn't it?

534
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,698
Now, did you do this terrible thing, Gerry?

535
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,802
That doesn't even merit a reply.

536
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:37,472
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

537
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:39,174
But you have the skill, though, as a doctor.

538
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,508
I mean, you could do it, lickety-split.

539
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,810
Now, why would I do this?

540
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:42,877
Why would anyone?

541
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,579
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

542
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:46,147
Gerry, I think we're gonna have to take you

543
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,749
down to the precinct... you're
raising a lot of questions

544
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:50,718
that need clearing up
in a more formal setting.

545
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,520
- Well, you can't do this... 
- Sh-Sh-Sh-Shush.

546
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,424
As of this moment, this is an
official GCPD investigation.

547
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,760
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.

548
00:23:58,795 --> 00:23:59,994
Officer Gordon?

549
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,497
Would you mind going through
the, uh, staff records

550
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,599
while I take Gerry,
here, downtown for a chat?

551
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:05,834
Will do, Detective.

552
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,403
Sir?

553
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,740
Jimmy.

554
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:13,908
Butch.

555
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:15,276
(chuckling)

556
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,412
Good to see you.

557
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,380
Come on.

558
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,550
(sighs)

559
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,719
Like old times, huh?

560
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,387
All we need is a bottle of applejack.

561
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,522
(laughs)

562
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,525
What happened, man?

563
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,860
In my head, it's...

564
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,696
we're still kids, chasing
girls in Harlow Park.

565
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,697
Yeah. (chuckles)

566
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,398
We caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

567
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,566
Especially me.

568
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,435
(chuckles)

569
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:45,139
Thanks for meeting with me.

570
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:47,408
What did you tell your boss-lady?

571
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,512
I suggested I reach out to you. She agreed.

572
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:53,681
Talk some sense into me?

573
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:56,117
It's a new dawn.

574
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:57,485
Yeah, like that.

575
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:59,954
She's not wrong, you know?

576
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,290
City's changing.

577
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:04,993
You really want Falcone's job?

578
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,830
Since we were kids, I
love you like a brother.

579
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:10,365
I love you, too.

580
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,666
Always. You know that.

581
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,935
I do, I do.

582
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,270
That's why I trust you.

583
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,205
And that's why I say to you with love...

584
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,107
Fish is doomed.

585
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,776
There's no way she gets the
chair. It ain't gonna happen.

586
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,378
She's a smart cookie, but she's

587
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:25,680
overreaching. I mean, come on, Butch, without

588
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:27,749
you and your crew, what's she got?

589
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:29,217
Very little.

590
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:32,387
Everybody knows it. You know it.

591
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:35,456
Maybe.

592
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,160
What's it gonna take to make you make a move?

593
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:40,528
What are you offering?

594
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:41,729
Name it.

595
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:44,132
Drop Fish, come over to us.

596
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,802
The club... all the businesses
attached... they're yours.

597
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,838
That's day one. A welcome bonus.

598
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:53,541
What else you want?

599
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:58,379
That's a good question.

600
00:25:58,415 --> 00:25:59,914
Let me think it over.

601
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,883
Yeah.

602
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,520
Hey, brother.

603
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,657
Don't think too long, huh?

604
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,537
Detective Bullock.

605
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:25,039
Wait here.

606
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,408
(chuckles) Penguin.

607
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:28,676
It's good to see you.

608
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,944
What are you guys doing?

609
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,779
Old friend.

610
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:33,581
Thank goodness you're here.

611
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,083
There's been some silly mistake.

612
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,351
Looks like it.

613
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,152
Unless you irritated someone important...

614
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:39,520
you didn't do that, did you?

615
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,822
Me?

616
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,090
Of course not.

617
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,825
You sure?

618
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,060
Examine your soul, Penguin.

619
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:47,295
Wait!

620
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,965
Don't go. Please, sir, I-I beg of you.

621
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:54,168
My patron, Don Maroni, is obviously

622
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:55,703
unaware of my predicament.

623
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:58,740
A simple phone call would

624
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:01,242
resolve things, I'm sure.

625
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:04,212
But, see, I like having you here.

626
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,115
'Cause I can sit at my desk

627
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,750
and look at you.

628
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,284
It's soothing.

629
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,220
Like a bonsai tree.

630
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:20,361
What's a bonsai tree?

631
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,135
♪ ♪

632
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:34,976
So...

633
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:37,445
did you see our friend?

634
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,846
I saw him.

635
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:40,314
And?

636
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,683
Eh.

637
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:43,551
I'm working him.

638
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,119
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

639
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,756
Just give him a little time.

640
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:52,360
Time, hmm?

641
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,062
Okay.

642
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:55,363
He can have time.

643
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,598
(quietly): Yeah.

644
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,368
I'm optimistic.

645
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,502
Good.

646
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:11,309
<i>BULLOCK: All right, Doctor,</i>

647
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:12,711
pretend I'm an ignoramus.

648
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:14,713
Shouldn't be too hard, hmm?

649
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:16,882
Explain to me this whole
crazy electric needle business.

650
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:19,317
When a real doctor like you does it,

651
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,986
what's it supposed to do?

652
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:23,722
Electroshock therapy is a common procedure

653
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,924
for mood and behavior alteration.

654
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,126
Like mind control? Of a sort.

655
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:30,128
Blue sky experimentation on humans

656
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,830
is considered unethical,

657
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:34,165
so we know very little of the hard science.

658
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,433
Okay. But skilled

659
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:38,770
surgeons can elicit very specific responses.

660
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:40,505
- Uh-huh.
- But those inmates

661
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,407
weren't treated by a skilled surgeon.

662
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:44,242
- You sure about that?
- There are no

663
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:46,144
skilled surgeons amongst the inmates.

664
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:47,412
Or the staff.

665
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:48,813
You're a skilled surgeon.

666
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,616
What... (sighs) We've been over this.

667
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,752
I haven't opened a body since med school.

668
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:56,087
(chuckles) I'm just messing with you.

669
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,456
I don't think you're the man behind this.

670
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,592
No, you're not the type to break rules.

671
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:02,594
Too scared of authority.

672
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:04,496
But you're hiding something. What is it?

673
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,964
Well, everybody's hiding something.

674
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,799
Don't play tag.

675
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,268
You're right, Detective.

676
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:12,404
I am afraid of authority.

677
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,738
And the things I'm hiding?

678
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,040
I'll never tell you.

679
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,675
Sounds heavy. Heavy?

680
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,543
Yes. And if you know what's good for you,

681
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:19,811
you won't dig any deeper.

682
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,112
All right.

683
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:23,448
I don't want to hit any power lines.

684
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,450
Don't have to tell me twice.

685
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:26,651
No digging. Unless, of course,

686
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:28,887
it has something to do with the case at hand.

687
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,155
Nothing.

688
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:06,858
Oh. Great, thank you.

689
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:11,730
Oh, you poor thing. You look so pale.

690
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,231
Any joy?

691
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,667
Not so far.

692
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,369
The files seem to be incomplete.

693
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,405
I'm wondering if there's
more in the basement.

694
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:24,109
Blueprint says there's a
records office down there.

695
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,878
Oh, the basement's closed off.

696
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:29,014
Unsafe chemicals.

697
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:30,715
Nobody's been down there for ten years.

698
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:36,021
Do you know the way down there?

699
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:42,661
All right, suppose you had to pick out

700
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:45,063
one member of your staff as the culprit.

701
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:46,398
Who would it be?

702
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,699
It wasn't a staff member.

703
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:50,402
Whatever. Just the first
face that pops to your mind.

704
00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:51,603
Nobody.

705
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:53,538
They're good people. I know them well.

706
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:56,107
They've all been with me
for more than five years.

707
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:57,842
We all came to Arkham together.

708
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:00,111
- Th...
- Wait.

709
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:02,647
Hold that. You just saw someone. Who was it?

710
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,516
Oh. (exhales) No, she couldn't..

711
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:05,784
She?

712
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:07,819
Who?

713
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:14,459
(squeaking in distance)

714
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,429
(door closes in distance)

715
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:19,597
- (short gasp)
- What's that?

716
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,300
Everybody's in their cell.

717
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:24,669
Dorothy.

718
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,406
Jim, hi. What's up?

719
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:30,275
Hi, Leslie.

720
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:34,245
We're going on an adventure

721
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,448
to the basement.

722
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,982
Oh. Well, that sounds fun.

723
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,685
- Can I come?
- No.

724
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:45,623
- But...
- Dr. Thompkins, what did I tell you earlier?

725
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,991
You should go home.

726
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,493
Why? What's wrong?

727
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:49,794
Nothing's wrong.

728
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:52,697
Go home.

729
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,032
I don't understa...

730
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,667
- Oh.
- Whoa!

731
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:56,968
You okay?

732
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,103
I-I'm fine. Okay.

733
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:59,971
I need you to find the main entry guard,

734
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:01,239
tell him to hit lockdown,

735
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:03,007
then get out of the building, quick. Okay,

736
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:04,642
- Hit lockdown.
- Get out. Will do.

737
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:07,011
(phone rings)

738
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:08,480
- Yeah.
- BULLOCK: Jim, listen,

739
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,281
Dorothy Duncan isn't staff. She's an inmate.

740
00:32:10,317 --> 00:32:11,616
I know. Get over here now.

741
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,031
(alarm wailing)

742
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:34,239
(indistinct chattering)

743
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:45,583
Leslie!

744
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:47,852
(people shouting)

745
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:48,753
(gasps)

746
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:50,488
(screaming)

747
00:32:50,524 --> 00:32:52,757
(shouting continues)

748
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,527
(alarm blaring)

749
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:57,162
(panting)

750
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,964
(screaming in distance)

751
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:06,571
(screaming)

752
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:14,612
(shouting)

753
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,417
(man cackling maniacally)

754
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:21,452
(alarm continues blaring)

755
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,355
Guard!

756
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:26,191
Guard! Help!

757
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:28,593
Dr. Thompkins.

758
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:30,028
- (man growls)
- Jim, behind you.

759
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:31,763
(man growling)

760
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:35,600
Men!

761
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:37,569
Men! What the hell

762
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,437
do you think you're playing at?!

763
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:41,406
Go back in your cells

764
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,774
right now!

765
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:44,275
You hear me?

766
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:46,044
That's an order!

767
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,479
(man grunting maniacally)

768
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:50,281
(alarm continues blaring)

769
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:53,585
(yelling, clamoring)

770
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:06,799
(horns honking, siren wailing in distance)

771
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:11,436
Remember, I'm a vegan... no butter.

772
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:14,306
- (phone ringing)
- SELINA: Yeah, yeah.

773
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,878
Hi.

774
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:22,281
Hi. I-Is this...

775
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:24,449
Is Jim Gordon there?

776
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:27,019
Yes, he is.

777
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:30,289
But I'm sorry, Jim is kind of busy right now.

778
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:31,990
(quiet laugh)

779
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,159
Can I take a message?

780
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,395
No.

781
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,064
No, that's okay.

782
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,799
I...

783
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,367
Who is this?

784
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:44,469
I'm a friend of Jim's.

785
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:45,871
Who's that?

786
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,307
Go to hell!

787
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:52,144
(beeps)

788
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,346
M.E.'s got her in the morgue.

789
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:56,949
When Dorothy Duncan was a
16-year-old nursing student,

790
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:59,284
she killed five kids with poison candy...

791
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,886
for homework, she said.

792
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:03,255
She's spent over half her life at Arkham.

793
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,690
When the asylum closed, there was chaos.

794
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:06,558
She must have just hunkered
down in the basement

795
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:09,161
- until it reopened.
- Forensics is sweeping the basement level

796
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,395
looking for her lair.

797
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,597
Poor soul.

798
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,832
- What was she trying to do?
- GORDON: Who knows?

799
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:16,168
Maybe she was just trying to
find a cure for her own madness.

800
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,036
She was crazy. Enough said.

801
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,738
ESSEN: It's good to see you, Jim.

802
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:21,673
And you got a win, huh?

803
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,376
Still fightin'. Nice work.

804
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,445
Yeah, I don't think my boss
is gonna see it that way.

805
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,680
He's working for the king
of all cheese grinders.

806
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,850
It's a crying shame, Cap... we
need to get him back on the job.

807
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:36,221
You know I'd bring you back
here in a second... if I could.

808
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:37,422
I know.

809
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,591
It's all good, Captain.

810
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:41,693
You do look spiffy in the uniform.

811
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:44,096
Yeah, if spiffy means dorky.

812
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:45,697
Thank you. Thank you very much.

813
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,401
How about a drink for old times' sake?

814
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,136
Sounds good.

815
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:55,540
Penguin.

816
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:56,775
(gasps)

817
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,211
Hi. Sir.

818
00:35:59,246 --> 00:36:01,580
Uh, Don Maroni.

819
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:03,382
Thank heavens you're here.

820
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,450
You look kind of frowsty.

821
00:36:05,486 --> 00:36:07,653
Uh... forgive me.

822
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:09,688
I've had nothing but a moist towelette

823
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,423
since yesterday morning.

824
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:13,725
A very sad picture.

825
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:15,894
You know why you're in there?

826
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,231
- I have no idea.
- A rhetorical question.

827
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:22,067
You're in there because I put you in there.

828
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:25,203
But, Don Maroni, wh-why?

829
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,239
What did I do?

830
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:29,508
Do you know what hubris is?

831
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,411
Do you know?!

832
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:34,012
Sorry.

833
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:36,815
(nervous laugh) I-I
thought that was another...

834
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,016
rhetorical...

835
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:39,384
question. (clears throat)

836
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,853
Yes, I do. H-Hubris. It's when...

837
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,288
It's when limping little

838
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:46,425
chickenbutt second bananas
think they're hot stuff.

839
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,827
- Sir...
- When dumbass underlings

840
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:51,463
raise taxes without asking me first.

841
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,799
<i>- Yes, sir.
- On fishermen.</i>

842
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,468
You raised taxes on fishermen.

843
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,937
They're out there in the freakin' ocean

844
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,973
risking their lives for us,

845
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:04,209
and you raise their taxes without asking me?

846
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:08,547
That's hubris, my friend.

847
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:10,782
I'm sorry, Don Maroni.

848
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:13,585
Deeply... sorry.

849
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,455
I will never do it again.

850
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:21,860
All right, then.

Hey, you.

Holy Mother, you stink!

Let this be a lesson to you, yes?

859
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,825
Yes, sir.

860
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:56,194
You're a smart monkey...

861
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,463
but you're a monkey.

862

And I'm the zookeeper.

Yeah, you're all right.

Captain, you should see this.

Look here.

866
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:19,518
Dorothy Duncan. Electrode wounds,

867
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:20,786
both sides.

868
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,187
Same gauge as the other victims.

869
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:25,290
About a month old. They
were hidden by her hair.

870
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:27,288
This is crazy... how could
she have done this to herself?

871
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:29,861
She couldn't. Not humanly possible.

872
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:31,596
Which means she was just another victim.

873
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:32,798
She couldn't.
