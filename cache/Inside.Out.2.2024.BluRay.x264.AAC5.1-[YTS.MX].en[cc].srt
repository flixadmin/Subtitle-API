We'll see you tomorrow.

00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,047
You are such an all-star!

170
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,556
You are gonna knock
the coach's skates off!

171
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,963
Hockey scholarship,
here we come!

172
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:21,835
Dad, stop.

173
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,632
It's just hockey camp.

174
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:26,068
I mean,
who knows what'll happen?

175
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,548

- [Sadness whimpering]

177
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,590
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

178
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,655
What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

179
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,056
Hey, don't talk like that.

180
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,432
Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

181
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,709
Exactly. Mom gets it.

182
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,373
Yeah, I guess.

183
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,149
We're so proud of you.

184
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,980
Night, monkey.

186

Sleep tight, honey.

[sighs]

189
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,472
Oh, Riley's so hard on herself.

190
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,775
But we can make
everything easier.

191
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,246
[grunts]

192
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,518

Don't look, it's fine.

195
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:12,100
This is for all those memories

196
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:14,399
that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

197
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,002
like this penalty one.

198
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,880
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

A one-way expressway to,

"We're not gonna think
about that right now." Whoo!

201
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,793
- [Anger] Not bad.
- [Sadness] Oh, Joy.

202
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,891
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

203
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,266
You take such good care
of Riley.

204
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:32,797
Thanks, I try.

205
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,904
Okay, let's do a sweep.

206
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,678
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

207
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,879
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

208
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:41,050
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

209
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,822
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

210
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,129
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

211
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:46,234
What was her name?

212
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,602
I don't know,
Janet or something?

213
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,330
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh! [chuckles]

214
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:53,607
We keep the best
and toss the rest. [sighs]

215
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,083
Nice work, everyone.

216
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,211
All right, Anger,

217
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:57,951
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

218
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,798
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

219
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,510
Big day tomorrow.

220
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,185
Joy, are you taking that

221
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,826
where I think
you're taking that?

222
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,267
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

223
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,338
I mean no. I...

224
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:25,771
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

225
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:26,974
You know, you're the only one

226
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,810
who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

227
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:30,453
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

228
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,315
and I know how important it is.

229
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:35,594
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

230
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,963
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

231
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,638
Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

232
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,340
Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

233
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,308
Yeah, many times.

234
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,444
Come on.

00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:08,367
[sobbing]

325
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,201
[sniffing]

326
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,835
Let the professional
handle this.

327
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:20,053
I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

328
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:21,752
Oh, yeah,
this is totally broken.

329
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:24,759
Well, we all knew
this day would come.

330
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,466
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

331
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,066
- But she really does stink.
- [all agree]

332
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,307
Oh, it's bad.

333
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,175
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

334
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,719
You are not gross, honey.

335
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,880
You're just changing.

336
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,353
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

337
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,121
we saw in the park last week?

338
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,698
[echoing] <i>Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.</i>

339
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,027
[Joy] Easy...

340
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:44,898
[Mom] <i>And just like
that caterpillar...</i>

341
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,140
Easy...

342
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,473
<i>...you're about to
get your wings.</i>

343
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,107
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

344
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:52,009
Just go away! Ugh!

345
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,682
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

346
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,196
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

347
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,325
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- [Dad] All right.

348
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,635
Who's ready for hockey camp?

349
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,830
[girls] Oh, yeah!

350
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,340
[Joy] <i>Okay, until we can
figure this out,</i>

351
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,410
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

352
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:10,418
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

353
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:12,256
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

354
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,127
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

355
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,257
How great is next year gonna be?

356
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:20,007
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

357
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:23,379
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

358
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:26,486
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

359
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,218
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

360
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:31,086
That's really hard.

361
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,257
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

362
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:37,966
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

363
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:39,539
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

364
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,783
We got a look.
I don't like this.

365
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,048
What? You're paranoid.

366
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,518
I never miss a look.

367
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,226
[Disgust] Enhance 224... 176.

368
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,459
Track right. Zoom in.

369
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,433
Right there!

370
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,742
- So?
- She's hiding something.

371
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,280
But what?

372
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
What is she doing?

373
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,087
She's looking at our look!

374
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:04,987
No, it's much more than that.

375
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,692
She looks the same to me.

376
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:10,064
Overlay and compare.

377
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,707
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

378
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,673
- [all gasp, exclaim]
- Oh, It's so obvious!

379
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,349
But what does it mean?

380
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,719
She knows
we're hiding something.

381
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,754
What is happening right now?

382
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:23,824
I don't know! I don't know!

383
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,967
- I can't take this anymore!
- Ah!

384
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:27,703
You spilled the tea!

385
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,775
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

386
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,844
Grace!

387
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:32,007
[whimpers]

388
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:36,019
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

389
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,391
A-ha! Oh...

390
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,486
Oh, no.

391
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:40,665
Oh...

392
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,867
Okay. Um...

393
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,502
Yeah. No big deal.

394
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,798
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

395
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,010
Is she serious right now?

396
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,404
How long have they known this?

397
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,613
- [Fear] I can't breathe.
- We can't go to high school

398
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,514
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

399
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,022
We'll still get to hang out.

400
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:54,587
And we'll have this weekend,

401
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,391
which means
we'll get one last time

402
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:57,823
playing on the same team.

403
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,798
Friends are forever, right?

404
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:02,709
Yeah. Of course.

405
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:03,771
[both] Whoo!

406
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,211
I can't wait to get to the rink.

407
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,381
When do we get our schedules?

408
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:08,809
[Grace]
I heard our room has a view...

409
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,857
Oh, this is so sad.

410
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,384
No, wait, Sadness!

411
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,760
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

412
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,060
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

413
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,697
[Dad] Here we are.

414
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,807
This looks really cool.

415
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,706
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

416
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,810
'Cause I am available.

417
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,178
- [Mom] Bill.
- [Dad] No? All right.

418
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,721
- We'll see you in a few days.
- [Mom] Have fun!

419
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,081
- [Bree] Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

420
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,954
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley,

421
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,325
are you sure
you have everything?

422
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,558
- Stick?
- Yes.

423
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,731
- Gloves?
- Yes.

424
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:34,866
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

425
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,667
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

426
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:37,802
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

427
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,309
Okay, call us if you need us.

428
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:40,377
I love you. Go get 'em.

429
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:41,548
Okay. Love you guys.

430
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:44,153
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

431
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:45,492
Bye, monkey.

432
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:50,028
Okay, now.

433
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,704
[crying]

434
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:57,548
It's okay. We need this.

435
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:00,984
[sniffles]

436
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:02,956
[gasps]

437
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,022
[Disgust] <i>Guys,
these are high-schoolers.</i>

438
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:06,099
- Oh...
- We do not wanna be

439
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,163
red and puffy, do we?

440
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,327
No.

441
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,032
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

442
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,741
to think about this after camp.

443
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,414
<i>Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?</i>

444
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,011
- Oh! There they are.
- Wait.

445
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,081
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

446
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,988
Our best friends?
[scoffs] No.

447
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:23,534
[girl] Whoa! Hey!

448
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,870
Are you okay?

449
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,407
[gasps] Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

450
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,112
- Ah!
- We gotta say something.

451
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,282
- Uh...
- Hey.

452
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:33,582
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know.

453
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,719
You're the varsity captain,

454
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,449
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

455
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:37,918
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

456
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,030
What are we saying?

457
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,300
We are so uncool.

458
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,263
Why are we
still holding her hand?

459
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,067
Just like me.
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

460
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,068
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

461
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:48,009
Riley, from Michigan, right?

462
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,548
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

463
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:52,255
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

464
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:54,524
[laughs] Yeah, that's me.

465
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,765
Riley from good old Michigan.

466
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,835
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

467
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,638
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

468
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,775
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

469
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,245
- Hello, everybody.
- [all scream]

470
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,656
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

471
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,725
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

472
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,631
[squeals]
Okay. How can I help?

473
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:14,964
- Uh... [exclaims]
- I can take notes,

474
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,636
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

475
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,366
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

476
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,437
Wow! You have a lot of energy.
[chuckles]

477
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,083
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

478
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:24,279
Anything.

479
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,990
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

480
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,085
Okay, love that.

481
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:28,451
- And what was your name again?
- Oh.

482
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,097
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

483
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,159
I'm Anxiety.

484
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,535
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

485
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,965
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

486
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,202
Where can I put my stuff?

487
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,612
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

488
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,113
[female voice sighs
in exasperation]

489
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,346
[female voice] I wish I was as
tall as all of you. [grunts]

490
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,717
- Who the heck are you?
- [grunting, panting]

491
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:44,985
I'm Envy.

492
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,190
Oh! Look at your hair.

493
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:49,201
- Oh, yeah, not happening.
- [gasps]

494
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,533
Look at her hair!

495
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,675
We need hair like that.

496
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:55,280
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

497
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:56,479
- Oh...
- [Disgust gasps]

498
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,520
What are you doing?

499
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,390
Hey, maybe when I make the team,

500
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,094
I can join Team Redhead, too!

501
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:03,224
Yeah, yeah.

502
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,725
[whimpers]

503
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:06,863
[gasps]

504
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,262
Okay, who's this guy?

505
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,166
What's your name, big fella?

506
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,403
That's Embarrassment.

507
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,007
He's not really big
on eye contact,

508
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,682
or uh, like, good talking,

509
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,018
but he's a really sweet guy.

510
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:19,557
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

511
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:21,396
Oh, we're doing a... No.

512
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,099
No, going high. Oh.

513
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:25,372
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy. [chuckles]

514
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,608
[Embarrassment whimpering]

515
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:28,405
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

516
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,715
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

517
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,915
[Anxiety] <i>Ooh, this is exciting.</i>

518
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,514
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

519
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,392
Yeah, sounds good.

520
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,887
What emotion was that?

521
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,157
That's Ennui.

522
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,035
- An-what?
- [female voice 2 sighs]

523
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,328
Ennui.

524
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,036
It's what you would call
the boredom.

525
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,512
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

526
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,975
Am I saying it right?

527
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,380
An-wah. No.

528
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,683
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

529
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:52,892
No.

530
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:54,628
How are you driving?

531
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,467
- Console app.
- [beeps]

532
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,363
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

533
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:00,467
Now, now, I know new emotions

534
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:03,373
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

535
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,378
and you just wanna...
[grunting]

536
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,880
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

537
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,722
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

538
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,764
- Even this turkey.
- [Sadness chuckles]

539
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,338
Okay, fine.

540
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,605
[Ennui sighs]

541
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:18,811
Cool. Lead the way.

542
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,904
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

543
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,947
[Sadness] <i>Oh, but what about
our friends?</i>

544
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,619
[Envy] <i>Val is our future.</i>

545
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,185
Yes, I agree completely.

546
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,388
We need new friends or else

547
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:29,499
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

548
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:30,624
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

549
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,103
- I mean, maybe, um...
- Here we go!

550
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,363
Wait up.

551
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,102
Thanks for showing me around.

552
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,368
Wait, why did you do that?

553
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,747
Sorry. What did I do?

554
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,613
We just left
our best friends behind.

555
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,718
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

556
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:43,158
No. Okay.

557
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,620
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

558
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,900
Joy, the next three days
could determine

559
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,830
the next four years
of our lives.

560
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,810
[chuckles] Now, I think that's
overstating things a bit.

561
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,381
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

562
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:56,475
What?

563
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:58,081
Look, we all have a job to do.

564
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,281
You make Riley happy,

565
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,653
Sadness makes her sad,

566
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,520
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

567
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,327
and my job is to protect her

568
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:06,229
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

569
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,072
I plan for the future.

570
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:10,242
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

571
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:13,212
[console beeps]

572
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:14,711
I was using that
as a cup holder.

573
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:17,155
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

574
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,428
and we're looking
at the following

575
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:19,623
likely scenarios.

576
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,494
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

577
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:22,728
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

578
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:25,336
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

579
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:26,468
She fails to impress the coach,

580
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:27,770
does not become a Fire Hawk,

581
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,640
and finally arrives
at high school.

582
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:30,985
- She has no one.
- [bell ringing]

583
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:33,182
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

584
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,453
- know her name.
- Ew.

585
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,056
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

586
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,423
Oh, this is a sad story.

587
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,204
It's a ridiculous story.

588
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,975
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

589
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,743
None of this
will actually happen.

590
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:46,139
Right. Whatever you say.

591
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:47,614
- You're the boss. [chuckles]
- [female voice 3] Oh...

592
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,455
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

593
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,291
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

594
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:56,234
Yeah, those were the days.

595
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,932
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

596
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,542
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

597
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:03,048
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

598
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:04,844
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

599
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,055
- [Valentina] <i>All right...</i>
- Hey, hey...

600
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,388
- <i>you ready, Riley?</i>
- everybody focus!

601
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,523
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

602
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,230
- And here we are!
- [indistinct chatter]

603
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:17,005
[Envy] <i>These girls are so cool!</i>

604
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,177
[Disgust] <i>And older.</i>

605
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,415
We are not changing
in front of them.

606
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,644
It's fine!

607
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,176
<i>Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.</i>

608
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,715
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

609
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,017
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

610
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:27,288
Hey.

611
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:28,799
Riley is from Michigan.

612
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,829
Okay, we're stuck with that.

613
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:32,808
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

614
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,671
- Uh...
- Oh, no. What now?

615
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,681
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

616
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:37,916
Cities in Michigan...

617
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,279
We need to make something up.

618
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:41,547
I'm from all over.

619
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:43,454
Nice. See you out there.

620
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,724
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

621
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,593
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, she wants to sit with us.</i>

622
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:48,797
[gasps]
Everything is beautiful!

623
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:50,908
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

624
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,707
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

625
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:54,683
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

626
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:56,214
But thanks anyway.

627
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,282
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

628
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,352
No worries.

629
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,257
See? Was that so hard?

630
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:02,361
No. You're totally right.

631
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:03,660
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

632
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,564
for the rest
of our lives at all.

633
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,874
- [Bree] No way!
- Bree and Grace!

634
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,437
- There you are.
- Riley.

635
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,347
Time to celebrate!

636
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,649
- Say, "awooga"!
- [both] Awooga!

637
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,294
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

638
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,594
[babbling, chuckling]

639
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,564
- Uh, Joy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

640
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,731
- [coach] Ladies!

Settle in means settle down.

642
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:27,811
I need your focus.

643
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:30,048
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

644
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:31,154
All of 'em.

645
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,149
[girl] Wait, what?
Are you serious?

646
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:37,657
[tuts] You're here
to work, not goof around.

647
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,028
Got that, Andersen?

648
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,671
Yes, Coach.

649
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,806
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

650
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,943
You get them back
at the end of camp.

651
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:51,020
Wow. Coach is so serious.

652
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,490
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

653
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:54,558
Thank you. Not now.

654
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,033
I know, right? [laughs]

[all chuckling]

656
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:59,905
Oh. [chuckles]
You think this is funny?

657
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,979
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

658
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:03,208
Skating lines.

659
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,748
- Now hit the ice, ladies.
- [all groaning]

660
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:06,782
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

661
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:08,659
[girl 1] Just make her do it.

662
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:11,968
[sighs] Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

663
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:14,167
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

[all panting]

665
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,647
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

666
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,644
- Skate harder!
- [player] This is the worst.

667

[whistle blows]

668
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,917
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

669
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:27,090
Then we'll divide into teams.

670
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,898
[breathing heavily]

671

[Fire Hawk player]
Oh, that Michigan girl

672
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,510
- is off to a rough start.
- [Anxiety] <i>Oh, no.</i>

673
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:37,880
Are they talking about us?

674
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,618
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

675
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:41,084
on the team if she can't
get it together.

676
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,458
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

677
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:44,591
when you were a freshman?

678
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,130
I wasn't that immature.

679
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:50,702
[Sofia] Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

- [sobbing]
- [Envy] Oh.

684
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,562
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

685
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,903
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

686
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:05,764
Um...

687
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,205
We can just, um...

688
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:08,471
I have an idea.

689
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:09,945
Okay.

690
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:13,489
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

691
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:18,725
Uh, Val?

692
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,528
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

693
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,967
Uh, I-I...

00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:24,941
I'm so sorry.

695
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:27,179
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

696
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:28,348
I feel terrible.

697
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,619
I respect you so much.

698
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,052
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

699
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,625
Uh, that's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

- [shushes] Joy.
- <i>You're a great hockey player,</i>

701
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,221
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

702
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:36,563
and I really
look up to you and...

703
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,395
Okay, okay. Thanks. [chuckles]

704
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:41,308
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

705
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:42,806
but that's not a bad thing.

706
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:44,375
It means you're on her radar.

707
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:45,618
Really?

708
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:47,215
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

709
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:49,486
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

710
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:50,953
Oh, yeah. Cool.

711
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:52,158
- [sighs wearily]
- Wow.

712
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,864
- [Ennui] Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

713
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,303
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

714
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,006
I'm just trying to help.

715
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,441
I agree.

716
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,646
Great job, Anxiety.

717
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:03,546
I stepped back, you stepped in,

718
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:06,592
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

719
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:08,392
But that was just
part one of my plan.

720
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,696
There's a part two?

721
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:12,197
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

722
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:14,273
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

723
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:15,433
for the rest of camp.

724
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:16,711
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

725
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,843
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

726
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:20,916
Let's do this!

727
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,484
One more time
on the same team, right?

728
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,626
Right.

729
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:26,794
Val wants us.

730
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:28,569
But we promised Bree and Grace.

731
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:30,541
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

732
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,945
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

733
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:36,413
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

734
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:37,520
Let's go.

735
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,289
She made a promise
to her friends.

736
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,952
She's not gonna break it.

737
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:42,924

00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:49,138
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

741
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:52,945
Joy, I don't mean to overstep...

742
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:54,009
- No!
- ...but it has to be done.

743
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:55,953
What are you... No!

744
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:05,937
[gasps] No...

but watch.

- I'm so excited.
- [gasps]

747
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:16,422
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

748
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,478
That is not Riley.

749
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:25,945
I know. It's a better Riley.

750
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,245
A Riley who won't be alone
next year.

751
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:30,586
We build her
a new Sense of Self.

752
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,586
A brand-new her.

753
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,157
No, no, no!

754
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,465
You can't go down there
with that.

756

I am truly sorry.

I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

Get off me!

760
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:47,716
Riley's life
is more complex now.

761
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,257
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

762
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,825
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

It's just
until Riley makes varsity,

or until she turns 18,
or maybe forever.

I don't know.
We'll have to see.

Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,877
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

783
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:35,248
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

784
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,614
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

785
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:39,856
I wanna plant one.

[Anger] <i>And then I punt her
into the dump.</i>

962
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,471
- [Anxiety screaming]
- What? No, Anger.

963
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,713
Okay, fine. No punting.

964
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:06,884
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

965
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,523
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

966
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:11,528
[Disgust]
Joy, this is a dead end.

967
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:14,161
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

968
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,799
Everything's changing so fast!
[crying]

969
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,072
So, we're lost.

970
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,512
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

971
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:22,944
No one is having fun, Joy.

972
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,584
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

973
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,154
She's having a great time.

974
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,550
[crying]

975
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,195
I thought you knew
where you were going.

976
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,391
I do. I did.

977
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,103
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

978
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:33,672
We're stuck here!

979
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,075
Oh, Riley's awake.

980
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,547
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

981
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:40,686
Come on, we'll find another way.

982
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,584
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

983
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,925
[memories clinking]

984
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,197
[breathing heavily]

985
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,338
[Ennui sighs]

986
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,570
Why are we up so early?

987
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:56,111
Because, <i>mon ami,</i>
we need to speed things up,

988
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,578
and that means
we hit the ice early,

989
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,285
<i>and practice like
we've never practiced before.</i>

990
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,020
[Ennui] <i>Aren't we already good
at hockey?</i>

991
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:03,291
[Envy] <i>We're good.</i>

992
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:05,801
- But the Fire Hawks are great.
- That's right!

993
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,334
[grunts, groans]

994
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,502
[Anxiety]
<i>Every time we miss,</i>

995
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:11,680
<i>we skate a lap around the rink.</i>

996
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,909
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

997
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,788
[Riley grunts]

998
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,198
[grunts]

999
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,035
- Yes!
- [Envy] <i>Wow.</i>

1000
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,304
That was amazing.

1001
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,382
We need to be that good
every time.

1002
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:31,877
Let's run it again.

1003
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,655
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

1004
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,985
[Anxiety] <i>You guys, it's Val!</i>

1005
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,254
We had the same idea.

1006
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,629
We're basically the same person.

1007
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:39,160
We're gonna be best friends.

1008
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:40,602
How long have you been here?

1009
00:37:40,737 --> 00:37:42,565
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

1010
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,136
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

1011
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,275
I'm the same way.

1012
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,885
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, my gosh. She gets us.</i>

1013
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,283
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

1014
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:52,685
You get what it takes
to be the best.

1015
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,059
Look at us.

1016
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:57,771
This is going great!

1017
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,436
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

1018
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,571
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

1019
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:04,280
People love
talking about themselves.

1020
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,580
So, what was your freshman
year on the Fire Hawks like?

1021
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:10,385
I mean, it was a lot of work,

1022
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,898
like, a lot... [chuckles]

1023
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,294
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

1024
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,435
Val is sharing things with us!

1025
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,579
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

1026
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,673
order some food.
You should come.

1027
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,144
Oh! An exclusive invitation.
[chuckles]

1028
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,490
We're going!

1029
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,919
- Really?
- Definitely.

1030
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,126
It'll be fun.

1031
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,064
[coach] All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

1032
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:31,664
Hey, Riley.

1033
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,739
Hi.

1034
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,699
We are not sharing Val
with them.

1035
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:36,907
[grunts] Early mornings
make me so hungry.

1036
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:38,281
I know, right?

1037
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,649
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

1038
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,557
Yes!

1039
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,528
See? I told you I'd find it.

1040
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:44,953
The Stream of Consciousness.

1041
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,998
- [Sadness] But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

1042
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,230
Hop on something delicious!

1043
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,565
- Joy...
- Ooh, deep dish.

1044
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,444
[chuckles]
And it's still warm.

1045
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,041
Extra cheese, baby!

1046
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,113
Sadness, come on.

1047
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,544
But I've been trying
to tell you.

1048
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,848
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

1049
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,596
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

1050
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,658
She's right. We'd be stranded.

1051
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:05,261
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

1052
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:06,900
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

1053
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:08,505
Okay. Uh...

1054
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,439
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

1055
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:12,785
and go back to Headquarters,

1056
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,579
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

1057
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,381
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

1058
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:17,754
I don't think so, punty.

1059
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,397
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

1060
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,659
Thank you.

1061
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,933
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

1062
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,304
Yeah, not happening.

1063
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,816
[gasps] Oh, no, not me.

1064
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,714
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

1065
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,958
You know the console
better than anybody.

1066
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:36,223
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

1067
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:37,662
I mean, you say that,

1068
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:41,236
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

1069
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:43,038
"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

1070
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,673
than most folks realize.

1071
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,407
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

1072
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:47,579
That sounds like a yes.

1073
00:39:47,715 --> 00:39:48,621
[man on radio]
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

1074
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:49,882
<i>You on break again?</i>

1075
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:51,928
Ooh! Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

1076
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,263
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

1077
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:55,759
<i>Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.</i>
Oh, I love 'em!

1078
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,235
We'll signal you
when we get there,

1079
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:59,100
- and then you bring us back.
- Oh...

1080
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:01,371
[Joy] Sadness, it's the fastest
way back to Headquarters.

1081
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:02,507
Joy, I can't do it.

1082
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:05,048
I'm not strong like you are.

1083
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:06,490
I know you, Sadness.

1084
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,049
You are strong.

1085
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:11,126
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

1086
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,762
but you got this.

1087
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:14,864
- [Joy grunts]
- [Sadness whimpers]

1088
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,843
Just don't look down
and keep moving.

1089
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:18,570
[Sadness] Yeah, I can do it.

1090
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,381
[crying hysterically]

1091
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,314
She'll be okay. Right?

1092
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:25,187
Uh, fifty-fifty.

1093
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,230
Mmm! You want one?

1094
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,394
But we hate those things.

1095
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,095
They taste like cardboard.

1096
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,534
- [Embarrassment groaning]
- We can't say no to Val.

1097
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,505
Okay, no, you're so right.

1098
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,883
We eat whatever Val eats.

1099
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,482
- That's the spirit!
- Whoo!

1100
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,849
Envy, I think you're really
in the zone.

1101
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,283
Take the wheel,
I'll be right back.

1102
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:44,223
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

1103
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,296
She picked me.

1104
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:47,262
You care too much about things.

1105
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:49,668
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1106
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,471
It's got
a very interesting texture.

1107
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:54,875
It tastes like... Mmm...

1108
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,046
What does it remind me of?
Um...

1109
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,527
Cardboard? Asparagus?
Broccoli?

1110
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,331
What are they doing to her
up there?

1111
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:04,803
I don't know, but we have to go.

1112
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:06,030
No! No way am I step...

1113
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,975
- We have to. Riley needs us.
- [groans]

1114
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,142
Okay, fine!

1115
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,975
Ugh. Ew! Ew!

1116

always trying to
hang out with us?

1272
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:34,581
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1273
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:35,721
Well, yeah.

1274
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,422
- I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1275
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,718
We had a great time.

1276
00:46:38,853 --> 00:46:40,385
- Grace, you are not helping.
- [console buzzes]

1277
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:41,656
[sarcastically] Oh, yeah,

1278
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:43,536
- we had a great time.
- [Fire Hawks exclaim]

[Riley echoing] <i>Great time.</i>

1280
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,106
[worker clamoring]

1281
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:48,908
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1282
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:50,410
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1283
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:52,986
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1284
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:55,552
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1285
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,192
Best night of my life.

1286
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:00,401
Well, this has been really fun.

1287
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:01,635
Extremely.

1288
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:02,735
But we're gonna go now.

1289
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,372
Okay, bye.

1290
00:47:04,508 --> 00:47:05,676
- [♪ upbeat pop music playing]
- Oh, this is

1291
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:06,882
the best band ever!

1292
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:09,117
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1293
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:12,120
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1294
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:13,488
we have all the friends we need.

1295
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,896
- [Riley laughing]
- [Sofia] Night, guys.

1296
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,932
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1297
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:19,071
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1298
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:20,168
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1299
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:21,442
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1300
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,938
What scrimmage?

1301
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,115
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1302
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,948
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1303
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,083
Don't tell her that.

1304
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:29,793
Val scored two goals.

1305
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,461
No freshman has ever done that.

1306
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:32,858
Dani, stop.

1307
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:34,865
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1308
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:37,038
but it basically is.

1309
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:39,107
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1310
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:40,376
[Anxiety] <i>Did you hear that?</i>

1311
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:42,449
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1312
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:45,788
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1313
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,257
[grunts] Excellent point.

1314
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:49,422
Let's get
these memories downstairs.

1315
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:50,528
[memories clattering]

1316
00:47:50,963 --> 00:47:52,168
Oh...

1317
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:56,672
[memories clattering]

1318
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,992
Is that broccoli?

1319
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,496
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1320
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,631
Great observation.

1321
00:48:06,768 --> 00:48:07,825
The long way did turn out

1322
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:08,936
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1323
00:48:09,072 --> 00:48:10,435
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1324
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,776
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1325
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:14,680
Or let's play the quiet game!

1326
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:16,478
One, two, three, hush.

1327
00:48:16,614 --> 00:48:17,911
[Anger] I'll tell you
what we do,

1328
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:19,352
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1329
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:20,958
[Joy] Anger,
now is not the time.

1330
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:22,257
[Disgust] Joy, this is useless.

1331
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:23,965
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1332
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,166
and we're never
going to find her.

1333
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:26,367
[worker] You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1334
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,433
- Forget 'em!
- No, no, no, I can find her.

1335
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,307
I just need to get
a better view.

1336
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:32,643
[gasps]

1337
00:48:34,854 --> 00:48:36,750
[machine whirring]

1338
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:46,075
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1339
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:47,506
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1340
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:49,850
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1341
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:51,687
This whole trip is just a series

1342
00:48:51,823 --> 00:48:53,155
of deader and deader ends.

1343
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,294
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1344
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:58,056
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1345
00:48:58,191 --> 00:49:00,202
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1346
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,405
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1347
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,046
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1348
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,846
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1349
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:12,491
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1350
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:16,835
Delusional?

1351
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:19,166
Of course I'm delusional!

1352
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:21,709
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1353
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,449
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1354
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:27,557
Jiminy mother-loving
toaster strudel!

[all gasp]

1356
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:30,520
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1357
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:32,299
Of course I don't!

1358
00:49:33,032 --> 00:49:34,501
[sighs]

1359
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,804
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1360
00:49:41,787 --> 00:49:43,553
Anxiety is right!

1361
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:47,593
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1362
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:51,766
And that hurts.

1363
00:49:52,665 --> 00:49:53,869
It really hurts.

1364
00:49:58,715 --> 00:50:00,819
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1365
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:02,425
A lot.

1366
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,529
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1367
00:50:06,366 --> 00:50:07,896
But if you let that stop you,

1368
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,473
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1369
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:12,435
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1370
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:13,578
Ow!

1371
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:15,417
Come on.

1372
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,563
- [Anger] Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1373
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,965
- Riley emergency.
- [Fear] Thank you!

1374
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:27,704
Hop on!

1375
00:50:30,816 --> 00:50:31,811

[all grunt]

1379
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:43,800
Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1380
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:45,367
You don't have to ask me twice.

1381

- [Joy sighs]
- [Disgust groans]

[gasps] Look.

1384
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:53,524
[Fear gasps]

1385
00:50:54,491 --> 00:50:56,431
We're right behind you.

1386
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:05,312
[sighs]

1387
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:06,878
- Whoa!
- This is great.

1388
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:08,389
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

1389
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,024
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1390
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:11,157
none of that matters.

1391
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:12,694
Tomorrow is everything.

1392
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,993
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1393
00:51:15,129 --> 00:51:16,269
Ennui, are you paying attention?

1394
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:18,166
- No.
- Ugh. Embarrassment?

1395
00:51:18,302 --> 00:51:19,276
[Grace] <i>Well,
this has been really fun.</i>

1396
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:20,544
[Anxiety distantly]
Embarrassment?

1397
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,978
- [Bree] <i>Extremely.</i>
- [Anxiety] Never mind.

1398
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:24,083
- [Grace] <i>But we're gonna go.</i>
- [Riley] <i>Okay, bye.</i>

Ah!

1401
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:35,976
- [gasps]
- [Anxiety] Now, let's see.

1402
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:38,173
What am I looking for?

1403
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:39,546
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1404
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,648
and then you get there to do it,

1405
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:41,883
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1406
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,591
[Envy] We'll need all the help
we can get.

1407
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,351
[Anxiety] That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1408
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:47,058
[whimpers]

1409

Oh...

[Anxiety] Most important game
of our lives.

[Embarrassment whimpers]

1412
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:11,611
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1413
00:52:11,746 --> 00:52:14,151
- [cans popping open]
- [gulps, sighs]

1414
00:52:14,286 --> 00:52:16,049
So let's get the team ready.

1415
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,787
[Joy] Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1416
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:22,092
[gasps] Imagination Land!

1417
00:52:22,227 --> 00:52:23,603
Oh, you guys are gonna love it.

1418
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:27,037
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1419
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,079
Whoa!

1420
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:31,111
This place has changed.

1421
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,556
Mount Crushmore?

1422
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,153
- Those are her top four?
- [Disgust sighs]

1423
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:38,497
The only one that matters
is Lance.

1424
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:40,295
Well, at least
they got his good side.

1425
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:42,966
- Every side is his good side.

00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:46,213
Where all of our good gossip
comes from.

1428
00:52:46,348 --> 00:52:47,373
[Vendor] Extra, extra!

1429
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:49,487
Pipin' hot rumors
right off the mill!

1430
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:51,723
"The teacher's lounge
has a hot tub"?

1431
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:54,495
"Lucy from math class
is legit psychic"?

1432
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,897
"Abbie R's been texting Mike T,

1433
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:58,437
"but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M"? [gasps]

1434
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:00,199
Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1435
00:53:00,336 --> 00:53:02,078
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1436
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:03,780
And it even got bigger.

1437
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,281
Hmm.

1438
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,556
And orange?

1439
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:13,233
[Anxiety] <i>All right, 22, Riley
breaks her leg in practice,</i>

1440
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:14,299

1441
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:15,471
<i>Nice job.</i>

1442
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:17,132
<i>Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering</i>

1443

<i>after Riley misses a goal.</i>

1444
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:21,349
<i>Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.</i>

1445
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:22,675
<i>Now's the time to send up</i>

1446

<i>every possible thing
that could go wrong.</i>

1447

<i>We are looking to the future.</i>

1448
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:29,197
<i>Every possible mistake
she could make.</i>

<i>Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.</i>

[Anxiety]
<i>Riley misses an open goal,</i>

1452
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:39,248
<i>Coach writes about it
in her notebook.</i>

1453
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,318
<i>Yes!</i>

1454
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:41,948
<i>More like that.</i>

1455
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,120
[Disgust] Oh, no!

1456
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,092
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1457
00:53:45,227 --> 00:53:46,522
<i>Val and her friends like us now,</i>

1458
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:47,599
<i>but if we don't make the team,</i>

1459
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:49,168

[sighs]

1461
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:53,944
Okay, let's go to number three.

1462
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,341
- [both cheering]
- Bree and Grace's team win,

1463
00:53:55,476 --> 00:53:57,051
- and we look stupid.
- [groans]

1464
00:53:57,186 --> 00:54:00,518
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it. [gasps]

1465
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:03,298
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1466
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:05,668
We have to shut this down.

1467
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:07,532
- [worker groans]
- [Anxiety] <i>Love it, 37.</i>

1468
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:10,879
<i>Riley hits the puck
into her own net.</i>

1469
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,442
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1470
00:54:13,577 --> 00:54:14,684
I... [stammers]
I'm drawing Riley!

1471
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,248
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1472
00:54:16,384 --> 00:54:17,883
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1473
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:20,562
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1474
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:22,263
81, that is not helping.

1475
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,234
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1476
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,938
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1477
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:29,077
Riley wears knee pads.

1478
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:32,314
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1479
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:35,085
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1480
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,527
No, no. I liked it.

1481
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:38,126
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1482
00:54:38,262 --> 00:54:39,360
I'm starting to think you guys

1483
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:41,263
don't understand the assignment.

1484
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:42,473
- [can clatters]
- What...

1485
00:54:42,608 --> 00:54:44,444
[muffled cheering]

1486
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:45,639
[sighs in relief]

1487
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:48,577
What? Who sent that
projection to Riley?

1488
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:50,221
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1489
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:51,319
[groans]

1490
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,021
- [keys clacking]
- [console beeping]

1491
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,291
What is going on?

1492
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:56,595
Who is sending
all this positive...

1493
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,402
<i>Joy.</i>

1494
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:01,179
- <i>I know you're in there.</i>
- [workers gasping]

1495
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:02,847
- [worker 1] Is that really her?
- [worker 2] Is she really here?

1496
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:04,443
[worker 3]
Joy from Headquarters?

1497
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,079
The mind police
are on their way.

1498
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:07,449
[shuts down]

1499
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:08,920
Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

1500
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,723
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1501
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,297
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1502
00:55:14,432 --> 00:55:16,268
<i>Joy, I'm doing this for you!</i>

1503
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:18,277
This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1504
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:22,914
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1505
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,716
Who's with me?

1506
00:55:24,851 --> 00:55:27,021
- [worker 4] Uh-uh.
- [workers whimpering]

1507
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,961
Really? Nothing?

1508
00:55:29,097 --> 00:55:30,429
[Anxiety] <i>Sorry, Joy.</i>

1509
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:33,373
- [screen chimes]
- Yeah! I see you, 87.

1510
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:34,536
A cat.

1511
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:36,579
A little off-topic,
but I'll take it.

1512
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:38,347
Who else? Come on!

1513
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:39,619
<i>What if Riley is better than Val</i>

1514
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:41,079
<i>and then Val hates her?</i>

1515
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:44,623
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1516
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,400
- [screens chiming]
- [Joy] Yeah! There we go!

1517
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:47,895
[sighs softly]

1518
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:51,109
What if Riley is so bad she
has to give up hockey forever?

1519
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:54,175
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1520
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,512
and the Olympics call,

1521
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:58,548
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1522
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,858
Uh, Joy,
reality is also a thing.

1523
00:56:00,993 --> 00:56:02,627
[screens chiming]

1524
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:03,724
No!

1525
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,968
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1526
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,306
drawing nightmares!

1527
00:56:08,442 --> 00:56:11,044
But you don't have to
take it anymore!

1528
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,220
Pencils down! Projections off!

1529
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:14,351
Yeah!

1530
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:15,926
- Enough is enough!
- [worker cheering]

1531
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:20,026
[gasps] My projections!

1532
00:56:20,162 --> 00:56:21,369
Pillow fight!

1533
00:56:21,505 --> 00:56:22,933
[all laughing]

[all cheering]

1535
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:25,902
For Riley!

1536
00:56:26,037 --> 00:56:28,148
- <i>We need to be prepared.</i>
- [screen shatters]

1537
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:32,915
Oh! No!

1538
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:35,388
[sighs in relief]

1539
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:37,501
Okay, it's time to go!

1540
00:56:37,636 --> 00:56:38,762
Yeah, I think so.

1541
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:41,107
- Bring it on, coppers!
- [Joy] Oh, no, no, no.

1542
00:56:42,372 --> 00:56:43,372
[cop blows whistle]

1543
00:56:43,508 --> 00:56:45,077
- [worker cheers]
- [cop groans]

1544
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:46,248
[cop] Hey, get back here!

1545
00:56:46,384 --> 00:56:48,556
Quick! To the Parade
of Future Careers!

1546
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:49,883
[workers chattering]

1547
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:52,857
Grab a balloon!

1548
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,066
- [Disgust] Oh, a pastry chef!
- [Joy] Underpaid!

1549
00:56:54,201 --> 00:56:55,728
- [Fear] Art teacher!
- [Joy] Underappreciated.

1550
00:56:55,864 --> 00:56:58,339
- Oh, ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand

1551
00:56:58,474 --> 00:57:00,408
what that is. Oh!
Supreme Court justice!

1552
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:01,481
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1553
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:03,448
Get back here!

1554
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:05,254
- [Disgust] Move!
- [cop] They're getting away!

1555
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:10,623
[chuckles] Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1556
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:13,362
[Fear sobbing]
I miss the jar!

1557
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:14,799
Joy doesn't get it.

1558
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:17,273
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1559
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:18,906
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1560
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:20,577
Coach will either
make us a Fire Hawk

1561
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:23,750
or doom us
to a friendless future.

1562
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:26,924
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1563
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,635
- [gasps] Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1564
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,835
[Dani] <i>Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.</i>

1565
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:35,709
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1566
00:57:35,844 --> 00:57:37,283
- and read it.
- [Embarrassment whimpers]

1567
00:57:40,855 --> 00:57:42,392
[Anxiety] <i>Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.</i>

1568
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:44,361
She doesn't want to?

1569
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:46,035
Uh, are we pushing her too hard?

1570
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,032
We got to see
what's in the notebook!

1571
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,276
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1572
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:00,763
Oh, Riley, no.

1573
00:58:00,899 --> 00:58:02,630
[whimpers] Oh. Hmm.

1574
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,534
[whispering]
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1575
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,636
[Joy loudly, over radio]
<i>Sadness?</i>

1576
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:07,778
[muffled]
<i>Sadness, what's wrong?</i>

1577
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:09,079
Why is Riley awake again?

1578
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:10,516
- Over.
- [Fear screaming]

1579
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:13,319
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1580
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:15,049
- What?

01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,286
Newsflash, you did!

2063
01:24:32,421 --> 01:24:34,180
Wait, you're right, I did.
[chuckles]

2064
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:36,721
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

[male voice] You're welcome!

2066
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:40,331
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

2067
01:24:40,467 --> 01:24:42,303
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

2068
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:44,101
Confetti if we make the team!

2069
01:24:44,236 --> 01:24:45,776
- Good idea. Ah!
- [party horn blows]

2070
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:48,347
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

2071
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:49,880
Confetti if we don't!

Oh, is it Coach's email?

2075
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,868
No. It's Bree and Grace.
[chuckles]

2076
01:24:57,004 --> 01:24:59,305
Aw. I miss those girls.

2077
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,971
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

2078
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:03,379
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

2079
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,009
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

2080
01:25:05,145 --> 01:25:07,750
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

[Joy] <i>It's 3 minutes to 2:00.</i>

2082
01:25:09,385 --> 01:25:11,696
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

2083
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:17,371
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... [nervously] Maybe?

2084
01:25:17,507 --> 01:25:19,102
All right, Embarrassment.

2085
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,307
Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

[whimpers]

2087
01:25:23,246 --> 01:25:25,221
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

2088
01:25:25,357 --> 01:25:26,627
there's always next year.

2089
01:25:26,763 --> 01:25:28,055
I know.

2090
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:30,628
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

2091

[Sadness] <i>And great at hockey.</i>

2093

[Disgust]
<i>She's really creative.</i>

2094
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,538
She can be bored,
but never boring.

2095
01:25:37,673 --> 01:25:40,377
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

2096

[Fear] <i>She can have

do the wrong thing.</i>

2098
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:49,703
[Joy] <i>And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.</i>

So, Riley, how was camp?

2106
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:35,929
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

2107
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:37,230
Uh...

2108
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:38,558
But what about sneaking

2109
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:39,667
- into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

2110
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:40,568
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna

2111
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:41,738
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

2112
01:26:41,874 --> 01:26:43,276
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

It was good.

She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

01:26:52,256 --> 01:26:53,360
And what about
the red in her hair?

2118
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:54,694
Did she join a gang?

2119
01:26:54,829 --> 01:26:56,394
Welcome back, Anxiety.

She goes away for three days

Yeah. Sounds right.
