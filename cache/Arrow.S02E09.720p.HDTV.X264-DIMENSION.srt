1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:03,256
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:07,049
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,451
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:12,320
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:16,941
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:22,113
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:25,300
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,354
Previously on "Arrow"...
I'm Barry Allen,

9
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:31,122
from the Central City
police department.

10
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,957
I'm with the crime scene
investigation unit.

11
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,226
I have friends
that can help.

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,979
This miracle could kill you.
Do it.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,684
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

14
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,603
You think someone
found the recipe?

15
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:46,405
A centrifuge
and a large supply of blood.

16
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,807
I think someone wants
to make more of it.

17
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:53,028
- Oliver!
- Is he alive?

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,913
Felicity, we can't save him!
I know. We can't.

19
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:56,898
Ow!

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,334
Please save my friend.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,654
Hold him!

22
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,372
He's not going
to make it.

23
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:06,591
He will. We just have
to find out what's in his system.

24
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,787
I--I--I usually only
work on dead people.

25
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:09,528
Barry!

26
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,631
All right, I can
think of four possible diagnosis

27
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:14,516
for what's causing his body
to react this way.

28
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:20,272
Make that three
possible diagnosis.

29
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:22,307
Two.

30
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,760
Start chest
compressions.

31
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,351
Got it.

32
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:35,570
He's suffering from
intravenous coagulation.

33
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:38,523
His blood is unnaturally clotting.
It's like maple syrup.

34
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,041
You can save him, right?

35
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,749
Lucky you guys
have a rat problem.

36
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,668
Are you kidding?
That'll kill him!

37
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,136
He dies if I don't.

38
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:54,055
Felicity...
Do it!

39
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,811
Just the right amount of this stuff
will thin his blood enough

40
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,897
to get it
circulating again.

41
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,539
Let go, Oliver.

42
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,358
He's crashing.

43
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,945
Don't fight anymore.

44
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,497
Oliver, stay with me!

45
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,231
Stay with me.

46
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,780

Oliver, let him go.
Oliver!

49
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:44,589
What the...

50
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,191
What the hell
is going on?

51
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,092
You were injected with
a strong-acting blood coagulant.

52
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:51,813
You would have
stroked out, ahem,

53
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:54,866
but fortunately you had
a very effective blood thinner handy.

54
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,301
Warfarin.

55
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:57,819
Better known as rat poison.

56
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:59,404
Kid saved your life,
Oliver.

57
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,540
This is the point
in a lifesaving emergency

58
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,742
where you thank
the person that did the lifesaving.

59
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:06,378
You told him who I am.
Yeah, I did.

60
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,915
That's not your secret
to tell, Felicity.

61
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:14,002
I decide who finds out
my identity.

62
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,454
Well, we didn't
have time to get your vote,

63
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,590
what with you
unconscious and dying.

64
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:20,258
What happens if he leaves here
and goes right to the police?

65
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,293
He wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.

66
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,678
I trust him.
I don't!

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,063
What are you going to do,
put an arrow in him?

68
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,398
I am considering it.
Don't worry,

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,934
he's kidding! How is
this any different

70
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,735
from when your mother shot you
and you came to me for help?

71
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,437
Your mother shot you?
Or when you brought Dig

72
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,439
down here when he was
poisoned with curare.

73
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:38,142
The difference is that
I did my homework on both of you!

74
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:41,145
I don't just
tell people easily.

75
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:42,864
I'm not going
to tell anyone.

76
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,200
And you don't have to thank me,
but you should thank her

77
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:47,335
instead of being
kind of a jerk.

78
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,906
Mr. Queen.

79
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,383
I have to go home.

80
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,218
That man that I fought
in the bunker,

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,352
he has what he needs
to mass produce

82
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,139
the serum from the island.

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,442
And we have to stop him.

84
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,116
He touched your skin
when he grabbed your neck.

85
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:20,518
I was able to absorb
the residual oils from his skin,

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,821
which, when added
to a gel-based polymer,

87
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,356
might be able
to recreate his fingerprint.

88
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:34,566
Never meet
your heroes, right?

89
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:39,921
Mom?

90
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,841
Oliver, thank you
for coming home, sweetheart.

91
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:45,276
Is everything all right?

92
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:45,885
Well, I don't know.

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,313
Your sister has locked
herself in her room

94
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,147
and she won't
talk to me.

95
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,850
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.
Ok.

96
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,321
It's Christmas.

97
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:58,857
Yes.

98
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:01,993
But given the last
gala that we threw,

99
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:04,896
I think we're going to skip
this year's Christmas party.

100
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,558
Thea, it's Ollie.
Open the door.

101
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,242
Not--not now, Ollie.

102
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:20,178
Speedy,
open the door!

103
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,048
Is mom with you?
No!

104
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,535
What's going on?

105
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,271
I didn't want mom to see.
See what?

106
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,146
What happened to him?

107
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,532
Vigilante decided to use him
as target practice.

108
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,600
You're right--

109
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,537
the guy's a psycho.

110
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,039
Why didn't you go
to the hospital?

111
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,965
In this city, an arrow's
the same as a bullet

112
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:50,822
if you want the cops involved.

113
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,712
And mom actually
likes Roy,

114
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,997
but something tells me she'd revoke
his tree trimming invitation

115
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,633
if she found out he was
messing around with the Hood.

116
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:01,419
Uh-huh.

117
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:04,556
Hi.

118
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,941
Roy.

119
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,710
This is going
to hurt.

120
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,795
My anger's dulling the pain.

121
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,630
This will
dull it better.

122
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:27,612
Going to put
pressure on it.

123
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,831
Right there.

124
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:39,758
Diggle, I need you to come
to the Queen mansion.

125
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,261
Roy's been shot.

126
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,197
With an arrow.

127
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,932
It's a long story.

128
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:51,269
Look, just bring the first aid kit
to Thea's room.

129
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:54,139
Thank you.

130
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,837
Roy, my driver, Mr. Diggle,

131
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,227
he has medical training
from his time in the army.

132
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:00,812
He's going to patch you up.
Thank you.

133
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:02,347
It's the least I can do.

134
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,315
Look, I don't know what
the three of you are up to,

135
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:07,502
but maybe the vigilante
was just trying to keep you safe.

136
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,520
By shooting Roy?

137
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:13,024
I...I'm just saying.

138
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:15,160
Maybe you should
let this go.

139
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:22,317
So...

140
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,035
Are you going
to let this go?

141
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,470
No.

142
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:28,039
But now we're going
to do things my way.

143
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,352
Mom!

144
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,021
Hello!

145
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,725
Shado?

146
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:05,593
You can't be here.

147
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:09,330
I had to see you.

148
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:12,083
Had to warn you.
Warn me?

149
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:14,352
You can't fight what's coming.

150
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:17,088
Put down your bow.

151
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,857
Take off my father's hood.

152
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:21,743
I wear that hood
to honor your father.

153
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:24,262
And to honor you.

154
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:29,767
If you want to honor me,
stop fighting...and live.

155
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:33,238
Or everyone you love will die.

156
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,257
Ollie?

157
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,577
Who were you
talking to?

158
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:04,102
Get over there!

159
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,098
Mirakuru.

160
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,336
Take them.

161
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:42,273
Anthony...

162
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,842
You got what
you wanted.

163
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:47,562
You can let them go.

164
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,297
If you ever
cared about me.

165
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,066
But I do care about you, Sara.

166
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,653
Which is why
I won't choose to kill you.

167
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,538
But he might.

168
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,626
What are you
talking about?

169
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:04,078
Time to choose, Oliver.

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,298
Who lives, and who dies.

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,467
But pick quickly,
because in 30 seconds,

172
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,469
I will shoot them both.

173
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,145
The incubation
process has begun.

174
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:24,766
Serum will be ready
for distribution in 48 hours.

175
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:27,435
Two days.

176
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:32,440
And we will be able to create
a hundred more like you.

177
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,194
And the people
who run this city

178
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:39,881
will see what
real power looks like.

179
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:50,224
I knew the Vigilante
had partners.

180
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,893
He likes to be called
the Arrow now.

181
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:54,395
You three have messed
with some really nasty people.

182
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,615
The Doll Maker,
Count Vertigo,

183
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,650
Dodger, The Huntress.

184
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,519
We weren't
keeping score.

185
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,304
I was.

186
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:05,156
Barry.

187
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:09,243
The rat poison that you gave
me...are there any side effects?

188
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:14,082
Um, yeah, I think
hallucinations, maybe.

189
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,833
And excessive sweating.

190
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,952
Are you sweating
excessively?

191
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:19,337
You're
hallucinating?

192
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,372
What are you
seeing?

193
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:25,493
A girl named Shado
that was with me on the island.

194
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,628
Shado.

195
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,380
Sara.

196
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:31,048
How many women were
you marooned with?

197
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,017
Are you sure
this wasn't fantasy island?

198
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,470
You did train in a jungle
or forest environment,

199
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:38,005
hence the green.

200
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:42,693
Hey, let me draw some
blood, see what's up.

201
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,480
Hey, can I ask you
something?

202
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,865
Why no mask?

203
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:52,487
Not to tell you how to
do your vigilante...ing,

204
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:55,740
but the grease paint
thing?

205
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:58,075
It's a poor
identity concealer.

206
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,961
So find me a mask that conforms
perfectly to my face

207
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:02,914
and doesn't affect my ability
to aim while I'm on the run.

208
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,799
You should look into
a compressible micro fabric.

209
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,834
It could be great.
Found Cyrus Gold.

210
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,753
Who's Cyrus Gold?

211
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:11,389
The human weapon that left you
nearly dead the other night.

212
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,342
The kid did manage
to pull his print off your neck.

213
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,144
I've had facial
recognition software

214
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,895
scanning closed circuit
cameras all over town.

215
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:20,848
He's at the corner
of Delgado and 25th right now,

216
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,316
but we're just about
to lose him.

217
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,901
What else is at
that intersection?

218
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,770
A parking lot,
a market, a motel.

219
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,772
Could be where he's holed up.

220
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,775
I got this.
Oliver...

221
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:34,228
Why don't let me
handle this one?

222
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,847
It's just recon.

223
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,114
Fine.

224
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,500
But I'm going
as your back-up.

225
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,540
Don't worry.

226
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,958
I'll figure out what's
wrong with Oliver.

227
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,626
You'd be the first.

228
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,519
Secret admirer?

229
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:01,472
No, actually,
they're from my father.

230
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:03,591
What brings you by?

231
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:06,444
We need your help.
Cindy's friend was murdered,

232
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,446
but the police aren't
going to investigate.

233
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,565
They said that he ODed,
end of story.

234
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,201
Check this out.

235
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,236
He earned extra money
donating blood.

236
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,038
We found it in Max's apartment.
They wouldn't have accepted

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,939
his blood if he was
using, right?

238
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:22,076
Max went missing
the same day as the blood drive.

239
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,128
If he did
donate blood there,

240
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,864
maybe they at least know
something that happened to him.

241
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,082
I'll ask around.

242
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:29,584
Thank you, Laurel.

243
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,596
If you get bored, I keep a book
of crossword puzzles in the glove box.

244
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,347
That's not funny.

245
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:49,537
Ok, what do you see?

246
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,522
It's clean.

247
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:52,940
Really clean.

248
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,413
"Solomon Grundy,
born on a Monday."

249
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:00,998
Christened on Tuesday.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,751
I know the poem.
It symbolizes the seven stages of life--

251
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,819
from birth to death.

252
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:08,539
What stage is this guy in?

253
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:36,784
Go, go, go, go, go!

254
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,407
He picked me up
like I was nothing.

255
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,459
- Felicity, call for back-up.
- On it.

256
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:58,673
This about Sara?

257
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,675
You heard from her?

258
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,844
No.

259
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,313
I'm sorry,
this is...

260
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,099
This is
something else.

261
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,567
Cyrus Gold.

262
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,152
He robbed
the Applied Sciences Division

263
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:13,887
of Queen Consolidated
last week.

264
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,990
Detective...

265
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,858
He's extremely
dangerous.

266
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,927
The CSI kid from Central City,

267
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:22,059
he said this guy was like
some kind of monster.

268
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,448
He is.

269
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:24,732
Well, what is it, steroids?

270
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,701
Worse. It's--

271
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,521
it's...

272
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:33,341
Well, assuming I believe
you, why come to me?

273
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:35,242
I've been
compromised.

274
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:36,293
What does that mean?

275
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:38,179
It means I'd be
a liability.

276
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,630
You have to take my word
on this, Detective.

277
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,316
Gather as many men
as you can,

278
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:44,118
and do not hesitate
to kill Cyrus Gold.

279
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
Because if given
the opportunity,

280
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,055
he'll do the same
to you.

281
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,874
You don't have
to do this!

282
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,493
You got what
you came for!

283
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,045
Just take it and go!

284
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,330
10 seconds.

285
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,915
You freaking
psychopath!

286
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,385
History will make that judgment.

287
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,720
Five seconds.

288
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:26,093
Time's up.

289
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,512
No, no!

290
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,732
I guess you made
your choice.

291
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,685
No!

292
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:53,213
Hi.
Hi.

293
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,247
What are you
doing here?

294
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,549
I came by to see Thea.

295
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,302
Oh. Go on in.

296
00:16:58,304 --> 00:17:01,305
She's upstairs
in her room.

297
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:03,557
I noticed on the drive up
that your house

298
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,726
wasn't festooned
with Christmas decorations.

299
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:07,477
Well, we didn't feel
very much like

300
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,429
festooning
this year.

301
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,181
I know what you mean.

302
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,700
I remember last Christmas,

303
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:17,137
Tommy and I came here
for your party.

304
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:21,408
It was one of the best holidays
I'd had in a really long time.

305
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,029
Anyway, I should probably
go talk to Thea.

306
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:29,166
I checked into
the blood drive,

307
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,467
and it's all legitimate.

308
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:32,252
In fact, what
Sebastian's done

309
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,388
has helped save
a lot of lives.

310
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,223
So if the blood drive
is on the up and up,

311
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,325
then how are we supposed
to find Max's killer?

312
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,677
There's one
other thing.

313
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,096
All of the blood
donors at the drive

314
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:44,765
were subjected
to a psych evaluation

315
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,850
by the Langford
Institute.

316
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,104
Is that, like, legal?

317
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,323
It's not entirely
out of the norm.

318
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,336
And while someone
at the institute might know

319
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:56,744
if Max was on drugs,

320
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:59,780
there's no way of finding out
without a warrant.

321
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,832
Which we're certainly
not going to get.

322
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,284
I'm sorry
I couldn't be more help.

323
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,119
What are you doing?

324
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,339
Uh, just messing around
with something.

325
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:11,008
Shouldn't you be
trying to figure out

326
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,093
what's causing Oliver's
hallucinations?

327
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:16,947
Sample's still being scanned.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

328
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:20,166
You're really worried
about him, huh?

329
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,769
He takes crazy chances.

330
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,972
Even when he's not
hallucinating

331
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,890
about beautiful
island girls.

332
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,393
Hmm.

333
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:33,146
The other night,
I asked you if you liked Oliver.

334
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:35,399
I told you.
I don't.

335
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,517
I remember.

336
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,954
But if you did...

337
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:43,323
I could see why.

338
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,792
I mean, Oliver Queen.

339
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,778
He is a billionaire by day

340
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,464
and saves the city by night.

341
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,366
Sounds like
you want to date him.

342
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:58,588
I just have a little experience
with liking someone

343
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,875
who doesn't see you
the same way.

344
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,151
Protests continue
into the final countdown

345
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:12,993
for tonight's ignition of
S.T.A.R. Lab's

346
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,869
controversial
particle accelerator.

347
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,924
S.T.A.R. Lab's founder Harrison Wells
promises a new era

348
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,660
of scientific
advancement is at hand.

349
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,997
I guess I won't be back in time
to see them turn it on.

350
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,832
I know, it sounds crazy.

351
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,784
Human weapons?

352
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:29,586
Look, his name is Cyrus Gold.

353
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:31,538
He's the one that broke into
Queen Consolidated last week.

354
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,123
He's the one that
robbed the blood bank.

355
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,959
And he killed
all those people.

356
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,845
Where are you
getting all this intel?

357
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,799
Oh, man, what's
a matter with you?

358
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,968
Talking to the Vigilante's what
got you demoted in the first place.

359
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,054
Look, we take a small squad.

360
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,923
McCarthy and Evans
from SWAT, Jones.

361
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,641
We can bring this guy down.

362
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,677
I promised Jeannie
I'd take her Christmas shopping.

363
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,062
Lucas.

364
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:57,064
Please.

365
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,732
Fine.

366
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,367
But you get to call
Jeanie and tell her

367
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,651
I'm not taking her
shopping.

368
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:04,037
Hey, sir. I don't
mean to overstep,

369
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,822
but could you guys
use an extra man?

370
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,279
Grab a vest, Officer Daily.

371
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:19,119
The police are onto Gold.

372
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,921
They're looking for him.

373
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,389
I made sure
I'm in the loop.

374
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:25,458
We are too close
to let the police interfere.

375
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,595
Brother Cyrus.

376
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:31,231
The police
are eager to meet you.

377
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,733
Introduce yourself.

378
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,238
So, any plans for Christmas?

379
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,607
Lighting my menorah.

380
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,275
Hey.

381
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:44,911
Hi. How are you feeling?

382
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,997
Fine. Just...

383
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,665
It's a little bit
crowded at my house,

384
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,751
and I wanted to come
down here to get a little privacy.

385
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,420
Yeah.

386
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,838
Come on, Barry.

387
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,007
We can watch the countdown
at Big Belly Burger.

388
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,492
Your blood analysis
is almost done.

389
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:01,711
Thank you.

390
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:25,652
What's the matter, kid?

391
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:29,689
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

392
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:31,491
Are you sure he's in?

393
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,793
Yes, sir. Sector car
spotted Cyrus Gold entering.

394
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,195
He hasn't left.

395
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:37,330
Safeties off.

396
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:54,541
This is a nice place.

397
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:55,909
It's a bit more
comfortable

398
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:58,211
than the fuselage
on the island.

399
00:22:58,213 --> 00:22:59,579
You're not real.

400
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,548
Neither are you.

401
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,417
You told everyone
when you started this crusade

402
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,186
that it was about

403
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:10,257
making up
for your father's sins.

404
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,426
That was a lie.

405
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:17,430
This charade is to atone
for your sins.

406
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,099
You're dead.

407
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:20,967
You are not a hero.

408
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,736
Or a friend.

409
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:25,905
Or a brother.
You are nothing.

410
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,241
Do not turn your back on me,

411
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,476
not again.

412
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:35,231
You're gone.

413
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,617
Wherever I am...

414
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,486
It's time you joined me.

415
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,378
They say a coward
dies a thousand deaths.

416
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,797
But even that wouldn't
be enough for you.

417
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,932
I tried to save you!

418
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,634
And her.

419
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:56,436
But you couldn't.

420
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,888
Just like you couldn't
save this city.

421
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:18,024
The island didn't
make you strong, kid.

422
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,526
It revealed you to be weak.

423
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,771
Thank you for being
my shopping guide.

424
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:43,133
Are you ok?

425
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:45,352
Uh, yeah, it's just, um,

426
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:47,187
can I ask you a question?

427
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,640
It's about the blood drive
you sponsored.

428
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:51,475
Of course.
It's a wonderful cause.

429
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:54,027
Especially with the underfunded
hospitals we're dealing with.

430
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,595
What about it?

431
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,734
Hello?

432
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:04,855
What?!

433
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:07,424
Ok, I'll be right over.

434
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,910
What happened?

435
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:11,829
My father. Um...

436
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:14,832
He's in the ICU.
I'm so sorry.

437
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,583
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

438
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:19,203
I'm sorry.

439
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,228
What happened
in here?

440
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,447
Did someone break in?
No.

441
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,401
Your blood analysis
is done. Good news.

442
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:36,687
So you know
what's in my system?

443
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,773
That's the thing--
your blood's clean.

444
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:41,074
There's nothing
wrong with you.

445
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:42,359
Then why am I hallucinating?!

446
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:43,660
I don't know.

447
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,245
But whatever
your problem is,

448
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,864
it's not pharmacological.
It's psychological.

449
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:49,199
It's in your head.
It's in my head.

450
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,651
Oh, my God.

451
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,921
Oliver.

452
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,628
Dad!

453
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,614
Honey.

454
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,332
Honey.

455
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:10,387
Well, I can wiggle my toes,
it must be a good sign.

456
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:14,975
I'm all right,
honey, I'm fine.

457
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,977
How's Lucas, is he all right?

458
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:20,731
I--I'm sorry.

459
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,067
What do you mean?

460
00:26:33,444 --> 00:26:35,796
I got to call Jeannie.
I got to call his wife.

461
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:39,466
No, Dad, I'll do it.
You just...stay here.

462
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,419
Get some rest.

463
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,818
What are you
doing here?

464
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,604
Wanted to make sure
your father was ok.

465
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:03,023
He is.

466
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:05,993
I wanted to make sure
you were, too.

467
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,626
How are you, Detective?

468
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:26,229
I'm alive.

469
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:28,765
Unlike most everyone else
in my unit.

470
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:31,468
I'm sorry
about your partner.

471
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,870
I took him in there.

472
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,523
Because of me.

473
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:37,607
I hate to disappoint you,

474
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:40,366
but not every death
in this city is on you.

475
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,399
I got this off Gold.

476
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:47,317
Hopefully you can
do something with it.

477
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,236
I didn't believe it
at first, but this guy,

478
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:51,705
I mean, it's like
he's not human.

479
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,376
He's human.

480
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:59,162
Well, then you can kill him.

481
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:01,999
For Hilton. And me.

482
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,508
I think those
are sharp enough.

483
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:18,265
Apparently I'm not.

484
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:20,734
Diggle, do you think
I'm losing my mind?

485
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:25,772
No more than
the rest of us.

486
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:27,607
I saw...

487
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,445
Slade Wilson.

488
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:34,915
Slade was my friend
on the island,

489
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,833
and...

490
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:41,788
like Shado,
he is dead because of me.

491
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,656
Mr. Lance
just told me

492
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,793
that not every
death in this city is my fault.

493
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:49,596
Fine.

494
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:51,882
There are plenty
that are.

495
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:54,167
When I got home
from Afghanistan, I...

496
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,970
saw a ghost, too.

497
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:59,005
Survivor's guilt.

498
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:00,840
Why us, not them.

499
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,526
I know why.

500
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:05,112
Then the "why's"
not your problem.

501
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:08,065
How'd you make
your ghost go away?

502
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:11,684
I figured out what they were
trying to tell me.

503
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,186
Which was?

504
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:15,655
That's for me to hear, Oliver.

505
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:18,375
You have to figure out what
yours is trying to tell you.

506
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:19,910
Guys, we got
something here.

507
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:21,912
I scanned the key
Lance gave you,

508
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:24,164
and traced its serial code
back to the manufacturer.

509
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,133
This particular key
fits a locked gate

510
00:29:26,135 --> 00:29:28,335
somewhere on Crescent Circle
in the Glades.

511
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,556
Where are you going?

512
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,841
You can't go out there
in your condition.

513
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,726
I have to stop this.

514
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:38,545
Oliver, Gold
left you half dead,

515
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:40,597
which is 50 percent better than
how he left Detective Hilton.

516
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,399
Felicity...

517
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:44,151
I don't have
a choice.

518
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:46,603
I'll come back.

519
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,721
Promise me.

520
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,702
It's ready.

521
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,565
Is this where you killed
Max Stanton, hmm?

522
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,398
What are you doing?

523
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:21,943
If you stick that
in me, I'll kill you.

524
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,433
No, brother Roy.

525
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:27,168
You'll kill for me.

526
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,146
Brother Cyrus
told me he killed you.

527
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,382
Guess he's not as strong
as you'd hoped.

528
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:44,369
Where'd you get the Mirakiru?
Who gave you the formula?!

529
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:48,886
It was a gift. A gift I would use
to save this city from itself.

530
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,651
Another failure.

531
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,272
Get up, Oliver.

532
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,598
Tommy?

533
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,717
You're not going
to die down here.

534
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:34,669
Tommy, I'm sorry.

535
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,255
I let you die.

536
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,808
You didn't
let me die, Ollie.

537
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,928
You fought
to save me.

538
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,629
Because that's
what you do.

539
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,048
What you have
always done.

540
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,300
You fight to survive.

541
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,986
I know I called you
a murderer,

542
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,471
but you are not.

543
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:54,973
You are a hero.

544
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,325
You beat the island.

545
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,728
You beat my father.

546
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,563
So fight, Oliver.

547
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,682
Get up

548
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:07,152
and fight back.

549
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,020
Kill him.

550
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:54,983
Hey. I am not leaving
anyone else to die!

551
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,151
You're strong, kid.

552
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:58,453
Come on! Come on!

553
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,988
Come on, Roy!

554
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,991
Fight. Come on, fight!

555
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,830
Roy?!

556
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:24,733
Hey, Roy!

557
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:28,036
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you!

558
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,521
I was...

559
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,009
I was running down
another lead.

560
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:36,261
It didn't pan out.

561
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,680
I thought you were
chasing after the Vigilante again.

562
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:41,583
I got so scared. I thought
something happened to you.

563
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:42,985
Hey, hey, don't worry.

564
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:46,254
I'm alive.

565
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:52,127
I want to serve
the people of Starling,

566
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,481
not the men and women
who think they own it.

567
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:58,150
Together, we can help
rebuild our city

568
00:34:58,152 --> 00:35:02,154
into a place where there are
no elites and no oppressed.

569
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:05,674
Where we are all
brothers and sisters.

570
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:09,978
So your campaign begins.

571
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,314
The city
needs a leader.

572
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:14,016
And putting
the copycat hoods

573
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:16,885
up to assassinating
the mayor was just the first step.

574
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:22,758
The Vigilante...

575
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,343
He destroyed
the centrifuge

576
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:26,061
and the serum
along with it.

577
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:28,931
I will arrange for you to receive
another sample of my blood,

578
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:33,235
and then you can begin
to mass produce the serum again.

579
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:36,705
When I ask you not
to confront the Vigilante,

580
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:38,390
you will listen.

581
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:43,028
Remember, your mask
can be worn by another.

582
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,115
You know who he is
under that hood, don't you?

583
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:51,587
I know exactly who he is.

584
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:54,723
He's my friend.

585
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,175
That's why you don't
want him dead.

586
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:59,344
Death would be
a release from this life,

587
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:02,931
and his sentence is yet
to be carried out.

588
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,507
I am going to tear everything
he cares about away from him.

589
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:16,678
Destroy those who choose
to follow him.

590
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:22,067
Corrupt those he loves.

591
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:24,486
Once he has lost everyone

592
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:27,623
and everything he values...

593
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:32,360
I will drive an arrow
through his eye.

594
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,433
Shado...

595
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:59,554
Shado!

596
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:16,705
Ahhh!

597
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:35,190
No!

598
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:52,741
Why?

599
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:54,593
I...

600
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:56,578
Ivo just shot her.

601
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
He didn't say why.

602
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:01,667
Whoever did this to her...

603
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:03,752
is going to suffer.

604
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:09,457
Still have a ghost problem?

605
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,426
No.

606
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:13,895
I got the message.

607
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:16,539
But we...

608
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,423
We have other problems.

609
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,425
Wouldn't be us
if we didn't.

610
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,744
Roy was injected
with the serum.

611
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:24,546
Oh, my God, is he ok?

612
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:28,099
He's alive.

613
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,218
But we are going
to have to keep an eye on him.

614
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,503
And Cyrus Gold?

615
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:34,189
Died on Saturday,
buried on Sunday.

616
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,441
But he was working
with someone.

617
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:37,726
I saw him,
he wore a mask

618
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:41,780
with the image
of a...of a skull.

619
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:44,599
He's trying to mass produce
the serum to build an army.

620
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:46,100
For what?

621
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:48,403
You're a soldier.

622
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,872
What's the primary
purpose of an army?

623
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:53,775
War.

624
00:38:58,948 --> 00:38:59,875
Where's Barry?

625
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,755
He went back to Central City.
Oh.

626
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,938
Wanted to get home in time to see
them turn on the particle accelerator.

627
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:10,559
I should take this.

628
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,029
Hi.

629
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,280
Hey

630
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,949
Did you make it?

631
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:19,535
I made it back
to Central City in time,

632
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:22,621
but I missed the cut off
in line at S.T.A.R. Labs.

633
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:25,374
I was late, as usual.

634
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:29,711
But in spirit
of not being late again,

635
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:32,848
uh, if you ever decide that

636
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,800
Oliver Queen
isn't the guy for you;

637
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,685
if you decide that

638
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,971
you want to go
on a date with

639
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:41,773
someone else, um...

640
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:45,927
You should know that
that guy, he'll be on time.

641
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:47,479
Good to know.

642
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,982
Oh, hey, and I left
something for Oliver.

643
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:51,400
I hope he likes it.

644
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:52,651
Bye, Barry.

645
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:54,820
Bye, Felicity.

646
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:02,597
I'm Linda Park and we're live
outside  S.T.A.R. Labs

647
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,594
despite the inclement weather,
which is only going to get worse.

648
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:08,796
The torrential downpour has
driven away almost all the protesters

649
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:11,029
though S.T.A.R. Labs
CEO Harrison Wells has assured us

650
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:15,117
that the storm tonight will in
no way affect the particle accelerator,

651
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,653
which is up
and running smoothly.

652
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:27,429
Wait, we are now
being told to evacuate the facility.

653
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,348
The storm may have
caused a malfunction

654
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,166
to the primary
cooling system.

655
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,668
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator,

656
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,638
but so far have been unable
to regain control of the system.

657
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:38,349
Even the Arrow deserves
a Christmas present.

658
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:42,686
Here.

659
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:53,530
How do I look?

660
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:56,367
Like a hero.
