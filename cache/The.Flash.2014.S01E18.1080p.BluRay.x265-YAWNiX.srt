1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:07,090
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,909
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,246
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,873
Same. Well, as fast as I can run.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,210
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism, A.T.O.M.

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,921
- What are you gonna use that for?
- To protect people.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,090
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,093
I don't know yet,
but I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,512
The way that he described running...

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,265
feeling the wind and the power...

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,684
it's like he was
talking from experience.

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,271
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,692
Eddie, we need your help.

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,033
Pedal to the metal.

22
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,834
We got a 10-31
in progress. Shiny Diamond, 18th and Olive.

23
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,462
- That's a few blocks from here.
- Has every crook in Central City gone crazy?

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,383
This is the third attempted robbery
tonight. Barry, we got another one.

25
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,055
- Hello.
- Ah.

26
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,808
- Eighteenth and Olive.
- Got it.

27
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,644
- Who's this?
- Oh.

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,564
Indecent exposure. Powell Park.

29
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,151
That ain't something
you should be showing people.

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,156
They're getting away, guys.

31
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,159
- They're not getting away.
- Get these bozos up ahead first.

32
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,870
Then we'll worry about the idiots
at the Shiny Diamond.

33
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,164
- All right.
- Gonna run out of room, though.

34
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,957
I'll take care of that.

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,336
What do you think he meant by that?

36
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,508
Oh, that's what he meant.

37
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,141
- I think we lost them.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

38
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,519
And by the way, you're under arrest.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,401
We need to go. Now. Come on.

40
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,612
Uh-uh. Freeze.

41
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,114
You guys missing these?

42
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,283
On the ground. On the ground.

43
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,037
So, uh, I'm just curious...

44
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,748
but, um, have you guys have not
heard of me, or what?

45
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,712
Nice work, detective.

46
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,301
- Good night, Dr. Kang.
- Good night.

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,865
No. What...? Aah!

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,034
No!

49
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,334
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang.

50
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,254
Engineering professor at
Hudson University.

51
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,672
Just got tenure.

52
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,758
Hey, so her whole body is covered
in these puncture wounds...

53
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,051
you see on her face.

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,261
Bites marks, maybe.

55
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,847
Whatever it was,
she must have gone into anaphylaxis.

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,432
- Damn.
- Yeah.

57
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,227
The blood sample should tell us everything.
I'll run tests back at my lab.

58
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,438
They can do it faster at S.T.A.R. Labs.

59
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,524
Well, yeah, but I mean, it's just...

60
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,776
It's just what?

61
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,904
It's kind of weird being there right now.

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,657
Barry, you know we have to play it cool
with Wells.

63
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,243
- If he finds out we suspect him...
- I know. I get it.

64
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,746
I just think that we should tell Cisco
and Caitlin.

65
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,955
They could help us.

66
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,917
The more people who know, the more chance
Wells is gonna find out we're onto him.

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,128
What if one of them slips up or panics?

68
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,630
- Or what if...?
- What?

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,716
What if they're not on our side?

70
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,470
No, absolutely not. They're
not involved in whatever he's planning.

71
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,432
I mean, Wells is their boss, their mentor.
They've been with him for a long time.

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,478
I've seen plenty of people
make the wrong choice for loyalty.

73
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,607
Please, do not include them
until we can be sure.

74
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,942
All right.

75
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,662
- Death by apitoxin.
- Honeybee venom.

76
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,999
Bees. Why did it have to be bees?

77
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,628
Y'all, I don't do bees.
Ain't nobody got time for bees.

78
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,962
When a honeybee stings...

79
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,840
the stingers are torn from their abdomen
and they die.

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,968
There were no stingers in the body
and no dead bees in the car.

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,640
A honeybee can only deposit 0.1 milligrams
of apitoxin when it releases its stinger.

82
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,019
Yet Ms. Kang was found with enough venom
in her system to kill a herd of elephants.

83
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,980
It appears not only is a metahuman
controlling these bees...

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,943
- but also increasing their toxicity.
- Bees communicate by releasing pheromones.

85
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,612
Maybe this meta is controlling them
through secretion?

86
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,031
Anyone wanna join me
in getting a beekeeper suit?

87
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,743
- I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bee.
- Just don't run into a lake.

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,163
The bees will wait for you to come up
for air. Then they'll sting you.

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,875
Discovery Channel.
Turns out there's a lot to discover.

90
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,545
Felicity, what are you doing here?

91
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,506
Can you guys come outside for a sec?

92
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,017
What exactly are we waiting for,
Ms. Smoak?

93
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,727
Up there.

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,189
Is that a bird?

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,191
It's a plane.

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,989
It's my boyfriend.

97
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,912
Hi. I'm Ray.

98
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,341
So he seems a little tall for you.

99
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,594
Barry Allen, are you jealous?

100
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,804
No, no. I'm not jealous.

101
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,683
I just... I really wish you would
have called before flying in.

102
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,436
- Oh, no. He flew. I drove.
- I'm serious.

103
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,980
All right? Now is not the best time.

104
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,316
Why? What's going on?

105
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,989
- Ah. My ears popped, so that's something.
- You're lucky you didn't break your neck.

106
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,742
What is it with billionaires
being superheroes?

107
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,536
So have you picked a name yet?

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,582
I'm kind of partial to the Atom. Shhew.

109
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,834
Are you married to that, or...?

110
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,754
Your A.T.O.M. suit.

111
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,715
Quite the technological achievement,
Mr. Palmer.

112
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,010
- I'm impressed.
- And he is never impressed.

113
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,805
Well, thank you.
But I can't quite seem to keep it up.

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,141
He means the suit.

115
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,851
Yeah, I mean the suit.

116
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,730
I can attest that everything else works fine.
There's nothing we need to fix in that area.

117
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,441
- The sex is great.
- God, there's two of them.

118
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,528
I know from Felicity that you have been
very helpful with Barry and the Flash suit.

119
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,823
And I was hoping
to get another set of eyes on my...

120
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,116
- Problem?
- Problem.

121
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,662
- Any friend of the Arrow's is the friend of...
- Hell, yes.

122
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,999
Uh, guys, we kind of have a lot
going on already.

123
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,380
There's a metahuman killer
that can control a whole swarm of bees.

124
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,756
Cool.

125
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,758
I mean awful.

126
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,552
I'm sure Caitlin and I
will provide ample support, Barry.

127
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,555
And I will be happy to sit this one out.

128
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,516
You...?

129
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,394
Ray, why don't you stay here
and work on your suit...

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,854
while Barry and I run to Jitters
for some java?

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,648
Sounds like a plan.

132
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,193
- Coffee?
- Sure.

133
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,998
- Hey, detective.
- Iris.

134
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,291
What are you doing here?

135
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,420
I am following up on my story
about crime in Central City.

136
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,296
Or lack thereof.

137
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,882
Could someone be working
with the Flash?

138
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,427
No, of course not.

139
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,138
You caught a flasher,
armed robbers in a getaway car...

140
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,682
and two jewelry thieves last night.

141
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm just that good.

142
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,395
What is going on with you lately?

143
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,523
You've been acting really weird
and withdrawn.

144
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,860
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were hiding something.

145
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,405
Iris, I'm not hiding anything from you.

146
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,582
- Do you ever go to work?
- Oh, you're funny.

147
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,880
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris
about the Flash.

148
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,426
- You have to.
- It's really starting to affect our relationship.

149
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,680
We haven't had sex in two weeks.

150
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:20,977
- Which you didn't wanna know about.
- Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

151
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,228
I don't agree.

152
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,481
- Well, I'm her father.
- And I'm her boyfriend.

153
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,941
When does my vote outweigh yours?

154
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,152
When you become her husband.

155
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,622
You know I left Starling City
to get away from the mood and brood.

156
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,918
- But it looks like it followed me here.
- I know. I'm sorry.

157
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,214
It's like I said before,
now is not the best time.

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,841
Barry, I have been through
enough with you...

159
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,885
to know when you're
holding something back.

160
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,430
Is this because I told Ray your secret?
Because he is trustworthy, Barry.

161
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,891
- He wants to help people, like you.
- Yeah, I know.

162
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,519
That's not what I'm worried about.
It's just...

163
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,397
I really don't wanna put anyone else
in danger.

164
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,484
In danger of what?

165
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,863
- Barry, hey.
- Eddie, hey. Uh, you remember Felicity.

166
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,073
- Of course.
- Hey.

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,200
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,538
What is wrong with you?
Is everyone in Central City in a bad mood?

169
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,415
I thought Central City
was supposed to be the fun one.

170
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,334
It's just, um...

171
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,963
- It's not...
- Felicity knows.

172
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,172
- Wow.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,715
So everyone but Iris.

174
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,425
It feels that way.

175
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,972
- How do you lie to everyone you care about?
- For starters, don't think of it as lying.

176
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,100
Think of it as protecting her
from getting hurt.

177
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,854
- With a fib.
- But Iris can tell I'm hiding something.

178
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,481
And it's putting this distance between us.

179
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,068
I have an idea.
Why don't we all go to dinner tonight?

180
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,405
A little wine and dine
is sure to bridge the gap.

181
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,409
- Come on, we all had fun last time.
- Sure. Why not?

182
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,662
Barry Allen, fifth wheel.

183
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,333
I can't make my 3:00 meeting.
Also, confirm my reservation for tonight.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,546
Last time, they couldn't find it,
and that was unacceptable. Thanks.

185
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,134
You see that bad man over there?

186
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,971
Tell your sisters it's time.

187
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,766
So you put
solid oxide fuel cells into the belt?

188
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,060
Yeah, that's the only place
to hide the hardware.

189
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,815
Hmm. Well, they should be generating
enough energy to power the suit.

190
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,444
It could be the operating temperature.
I mean, you're essentially...

191
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,279
Overheating the system. I figured.

192
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:41,910
But if we insulate them
with a ceramic compound...

193
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,246
We may improve the operating efficiency.

194
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,916
You really are quite clever, Cisco.

195
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,754
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

196
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,882
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

197
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,970
How do you turn this thing on?

198
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,393
- Cisco? You okay?
- Yeah.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,813
I haven't been getting enough sleep, so...

200
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,441
Cisco, we need you up here.

201
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,743
- Killer bees are at it again.
- Get a hold of Barry.

202
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,872
- Another bee attack. Folston Tech.
- I'll see where Joe is.

203
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,207
"Bee" careful.

204
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,252
- For real?
- Bad pun, sorry. Just don't die.

205
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,980
- I'm too late.
- Where are the bees?

206
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,607
I don't know. There's no sign of them.

207
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,037
I found them.

208
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,500
Uh, how do I get out of here?

209
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,878
Take the northeast crossways.
The quickest way out of the building.

210
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,842
Guys, they're everywhere.
I'm surrounded.

211
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,273
Barry!

212
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,486
Barry.

213
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,032
He's going into cardiac arrest.

214
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,660
Barry, stay with me.

215
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,213
Cisco, Barry doesn't have a pulse.

216
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,049
- Step away from him.
- What? Why?

217
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,844
We need to jump-start his heart.
There's a defibrillator in the suit.

218
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:12,643
- Charge it to 360 joules.
- Charging in three, two, one.

219
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,690
Hit him again, 400 joules.

220
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,194
Charging in three, two, one.

221
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,075
Barry.

222
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,123
Joe.

223
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,126
Oh, thank God.

224
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,548
That is it for the defibrillator.
It is completely fried.

225
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,261
- You're lucky to be alive, Mr. Allen.
- I was very specific that you not die.

226
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,432
- Yeah, it's a pretty big thing for her.
- Cisco, what happened out there?

227
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,393
I followed your directions exactly.

228
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm sorry. I led you the wrong way.

229
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,524
The schematics that we had,
they, um, weren't up to date.

230
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,027
They weren't up to date? What do
you mean? That's never happened before.

231
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,738
And what? You think
Cisco was trying to get you killed?

232
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,783
No. Why would he do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

233
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,577
I know. That's why I was joking.

234
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,372
Barry, it's our job to protect you,
and today we failed.

235
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,584
But that will just serve as a warning for
all of us to be more vigilant in the future.

236
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,296
Good news. The apitoxin is out of
your body. Your levels are back to normal.

237
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,589
Terrific.

238
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,135
Ray, Felicity,
we're gonna be late for dinner.

239
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,430
- Are you sure that's wise, Barry?
- You just died.

240
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,766
- Maybe you should order in tonight.
- Yeah. We could totally cancel.

241
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,812
I'm fine. Alive. Hungry. All right?

242
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,021
Let's go.

243
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,695
- That was weird.
- Yeah, why didn't we get invited to dinner?

244
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,581
Oh. Thank you.

245
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,332
Hey, guys.

246
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,335
- Wow, Iris, check you out.
- Hi, Felicity.

247
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,004
- Hello.
- Hi.

248
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,506
- Oh, hey.
- Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

249
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,675
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

250
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,719
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,181
Mr. Palmer, your table is ready.

252
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,100
- Great. Shall we?
- Yes.

253
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,355
Hey, how did he get a reservation here?
We've been trying for months.

254
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,357
I don't know.

255
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,195
Here's your table, sir.

256
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:34,160
I thought it'd be nice if it was quiet,
so I bought out the entire restaurant.

257
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,040
- Too much?
- Just a tad, sweetie.

258
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,130
Joe.

259
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
Oh, Cisco. Hey.

260
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,055
You just saved me a trip to S.T.A.R Labs.
I got some info on our second victim.

261
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,389
Name is Bill Carlisle.

262
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,018
He was recently hired at Folston Tech
to beef up their robotics division.

263
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,062
Robotics?

264
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,564
That's just like the first victim.

265
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,984
Wow. That is weird.

266
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,239
That's not why you stopped by.

267
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,909
No, I wanted to talk to you about Barry.

268
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,577
Okay.

269
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,169
Is there something going on with him?

270
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,172
- Something he's not telling us?
- What do you mean?

271
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,092
He hasn't really been himself lately.

272
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,428
Not that I'm aware of.

273
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,724
It's like something
is just really bothering him.

274
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,022
I think he's got his mind trained
on catching the bad guys, Cisco.

275
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,360
And he's probably worried
about when the Reverse-Flash...

276
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,070
Is gonna show his face again.

277
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,532
Oh, I'm not like the Flash at all.

278
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,121
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

279
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,918
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,631
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
It's just I got this crazy headache.

281
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,426
Thank you for the file and the talk.

282
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,228
- So how did you two meet?
- Work.

283
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,897
I bought the company
where Felicity was employed...

284
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,233
So she was forced to join me
at Palmer Tech.

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,110
It's not as creepy as it sounds.

286
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,655
So you two work closely together.

287
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,157
Interesting.

288
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:40,995
I guess you guys share all your thoughts
and feelings and...

289
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,873
Yeah, I share everything with Felicity.

290
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,419
It's nice that you guys have that level
of communication.

291
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,506
Oh, well, no, not "every" everything.

292
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:57,178
I mean,
sometimes it's good to just shut up, heh.

293
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,681
I get that.
Some things are better left unspoken.

294
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,974
Really?

295
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,436
I don't find that to be true.

296
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,440
Oh, thank God. It's the food. Food's here.

297
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,943
Our first course on the tasting menu...

298
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,238
ils a quail-egg frittata. Bon appétit.

299
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,451
Barry, I gotta admit, I envy you
spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

300
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,037
Harrison Wells is like a personal hero
of mine.

301
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,165
It's amazing just actually being
in the same room with him.

302
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,543
Yeah.

303
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,883
- I'll be right back. Just excuse me.
- Okay.

304
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,223
Well, I...

305
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,518
um, heh...

306
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,728
have to pee.

307
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,570
You've been acting strange
ever since Ray and I got to Central City.

308
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,780
What is going on?

309
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,033
Don't say it's a bad time. Oliver
might join the League of Assassins...

310
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,287
Laurel is Black Canary, and Thea is training
with Malcolm, so I know about bad times.

311
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,664
Okay.

312
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,503
Joe and I found out...

313
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,424
that Wells isn't who he says he is.

314
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,510
He...

315
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,098
He is the man that killed my mother.

316
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,769
- Oh, my God. But he's been helping you.
- Get faster, stronger. I know.

317
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,187
- Why?
- I don't know.

318
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,066
I don't know anything anymore,
especially who I can and can't trust.

319
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,402
So you think Cisco and Caitlin
are helping him?

320
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,237
That's impossible.

321
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,448
- Is it?
- They were trying to save you today.

322
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,743
- They did save you.
- Wells has also saved me many times.

323
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,787
I thought that Wells was a great man.

324
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,124
And I was so wrong about him.

325
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,043
What if I'm wrong
about everything else too?

326
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,628
Hey, guys.

327
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,923
Uh, things are getting a little
intense in here.

328
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,970
Please, can't we just have
a nice evening?

329
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,474
Okay, so it's my fault
that we're not having a nice evening?

330
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,809
I am your girlfriend.

331
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,146
Who you live with.
I shouldn't have to beg you to talk to me.

332
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,399
If I could talk to you about this,
I would, believe me.

333
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,568
But I can't.

334
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,490
- You know what? I am not hungry anymore.
- Iris.

335
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,494
When you are ready to act like we are
two people who love each other, call me.

336
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,953
I'll be at my dad's.

337
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,754
Thank you for dinner. I gotta go.

338
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,967
Uh, emergency at S.T.A.R. Labs.

339
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,428
- Go.
- Sorry.

340
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,643
Well, only 17 more courses to go.

341
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,855
Containment breach,
foreign object detected.

342
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,027
Did I get it?

343
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,695
I think I got it.

344
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,489
Where is he?

345
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,416
Thank you.

346
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,045
Let's see what makes this bee
so poisonous. Ugh.

347
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,547
You saved my life.

348
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,513
That is one odd-looking bee.

349
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,182
That's because it isn't a bee at all.

350
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,894
It's a robot.

351
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,855
No way.

352
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,879
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

353
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,594
Unbelievable.

354
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,347
This bot's got a 360-degree
vision system.

355
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,183
I mean,
we're talking multiple microcameras...

356
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,395
all coming from various angles
at the same time.

357
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,356
- Which means...
- It can see all around the room at once.

358
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,567
- That is amazing.
- Amazing.

359
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,776
Disturbing.

360
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,571
It's next-gen hardware
that's nowhere near the market.

361
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,949
- So we're not dealing with a metahuman.
- It's just a mad scientist.

362
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,286
Cisco, you said Bill Carlisle
was a robotics engineer.

363
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,080
Let's cross-reference his
previous employers with Kang's.

364
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,459
Allow me. Mama's been away
from the keyboard for far too long.

365
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,711
Okay.

366
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,883
They both worked at Mercury Labs.

367
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,386
Let's call Joe. I think
it's time we paid a visit to an old friend.

368
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,142
Twice in one year, Harrison.

369
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,437
You really are vying
for comeback scientist of the year.

370
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,815
- Always a pleasure, Christina.
- To what do I owe this visit?

371
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,903
Did you find my tachyon prototype, or are
you here to blackmail me for another one?

372
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,781
- Do you have another one?
- We came here for information.

373
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,076
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

374
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,120
Former employees
who were recently murdered.

375
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,124
My God. I wasn't aware.

376
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,753
Stung to death by robotic bees.

377
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,590
- You're looking for Brie Larvan.
- Brie Larvan?

378
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,342
A quite brilliant roboticist...

379
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,971
who once developed miniature
mechanical bees for agricultural use.

380
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,933
Kang and Carlisle warned me that Brie was
weaponizing the bees for military use...

381
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,351
Sso I terminated her.

382
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,105
Well, it seems that you would be
on her hit list too, doctor.

383
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,107
You've got to let us keep you safe.

384
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,696
I'm all too familiar with your inability
to protect things, Harrison.

385
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,198
I can take care of myself.

386
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,992
Good day, gentlemen.

387
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,954
Thank you.

388
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,547
Hey.

389
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,884
Okay, so we found our queen bee.
Brie Larvan. She's a roboticist.

390
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,721
Joe is running a trace on her location.
So far, nothing.

391
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,515
- Good.
- Where is Ray?

392
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,392
He's working on his suit with Cisco.

393
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,854
I like Ray.
He seems like he's a really good guy.

394
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,148
He is a good guy.

395
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:28,402
Just like Cisco and Caitlin. Girl.

396
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,032
Is that why you called me here?

397
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,704
You're in a tricky situation, but that's
when you need your friends to have your back.

398
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,374
- And how can they if you won't let them?
- It's not that simple.

399
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,919
What if Joe is right
and I tell them and it backfires?

400
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:51,091
Wells isn't just their boss, Felicity.
He is their mentor, their hero.

401
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,178
My hero.

402
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,305
Look, it...

403
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,725
I don't know what to do.

404
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,898
When I first met Oliver...

405
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,192
before I knew he was the Arrow,
he would...

406
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,444
He would ask me
to do weird things for him.

407
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:15,074
Like decrypt a bullet-ridden computer
or hack some company.

408
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,700
And when I would ask him why...

409
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,787
he would come up
with these ridiculous excuses.

410
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,082
And I always knew he was lying,
but I would help him anyway.

411
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,792
- You know why?
- Mm.

412
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,296
Because I knew Oliver was a good person
with a good heart.

413
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,423
Cisco and Caitlin...

414
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,718
they're no different.

415
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,649
Hey.

416
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,609
Hey.

417
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,279
So you're really staying here tonight?

418
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,992
Tonight, tomorrow night,
the night after that.

419
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,123
Do you think that Eddie's
cheating on me?

420
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,087
No. Eddie's not that kind of guy.

421
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,465
Well, I don't know what else
he could be hiding from me.

422
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,886
Iris...

423
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:23,183
Remember when we were kids...

424
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,686
and Joe would come home from work...

425
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,314
with that blank expression on his face?

426
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,986
Hmm. Yeah. The Earth-to-Joe look.
How could I forget?

427
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:39,533
I never understood that look
until I started working for the C.C.P.D.

428
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,872
Showing up at crime scenes
and seeing someone murdered...

429
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,333
it can be ugly work.

430
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,710
And I'm lucky.

431
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,463
I get to hide behind the science of it
and just stay in my lab.

432
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,217
But Eddie, he's out there...

433
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,012
every day, in the darkness.

434
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,809
And I just... I think that maybe
if he doesn't wanna talk to you...

435
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:10,647
about his work, it's probably because
he wants to keep you in the light.

436
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,152
What?

437
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,742
Just surprised.

438
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,746
You going out of your way like this
to help me see Eddie's point of view.

439
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,831
I mean...

440
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,336
Eddie makes you happy.

441
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,340
And all I ever want
is for you to be happy, Iris.

442
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,054
Welcome home.

443
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,523
Ha, ha. It's so fun to watch grown men play
with their toys.

444
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,278
You're so lucky.
Ray is so nice and smart and hot.

445
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:02,991
Yeah, it's kind of like I'm dating Barry
but in Oliver's body.

446
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:08,080
- A sentence you will never repeat to anyone.
- Your secret's safe with me.

447
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,792
It must have reactivated.
If it's controlled wirelessly...

448
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,878
I can trace its signal
and figure out where it's trying to go.

449
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,425
- Oh, no.
- Oh, boy.

450
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,137
- What?
- The swarm is headed for Mercury Labs.

451
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,391
Brie Larvan's going after Tina.

452
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,488
Hello, Dr. McGee.

453
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,950
You gonna open the window,
or should I buzz myself in?

454
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,335
How do we stop them?

455
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,213
She's gotta be remotely piloting those bees
from somewhere.

456
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,716
We need to stop
this bug-eyed glasses woman.

457
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,884
And her mini bandits.

458
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,469
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

459
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,388
She's in an abandoned greenhouse.

460
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,099
Barry, take out Brie.
It's the only way to stop these.

461
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,311
- What about Dr. McGee?
- The defibrillator in your suit is broken.

462
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,522
You cannot risk going near Mercury Labs.

463
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,525
The bees can't penetrate my suit.

464
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,068
I'll go.

465
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,071
Whoa. We haven't tested out
the new power system yet.

466
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,532
We'll do it now.

467
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,909
- I'm following you.
- I'm driving.

468
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,995
And I'm kissing you.

469
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,750
- Dr. Wells...
- Mr. Palmer will protect Tina.

470
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
Go.

471
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,269
You fired me,
destroyed years of my research.

472
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,563
You took everything from me.

473
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,648
What you were doing was wrong.

474
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,902
You wanted to harm people,
not help them.

475
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,779
I did what I had to do.

476
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,032
You mean ruin my life? Sure.

477
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,368
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

478
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,961
- Found her.
- Felicity, can you jam their frequency?

479
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,465
I already tried, but I might be able
to redirect them onto a new target.

480
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,927
- Ray, get ready for incoming.
- We have the technology.

481
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,207
It's over, Brie.

482
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:03,296
I know you're trying to kill Dr. McGee.
You think that she betrayed you.

483
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,174
I can imagine how that feels.

484
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,469
You think you understand
the sting of betrayal?

485
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,597
I'll show you what it means to be stung.

486
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,820
Barry.

487
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,460
Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency.
I'm controlling them.

488
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,754
I'm the queen of this hive.

489
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,674
Oh, she's good. She's like my nemesis.

490
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,510
I've never had a nemesis before.
I kind of like it.

491
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,641
- Okay, Cisco. Now what?
- Ray, get to the ocean.

492
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,769
If the bots follow you into water,
their electronics will fry.

493
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,188
Got it.

494
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,023
Wait, but so will my suit.

495
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,415
Cisco, I'm fried.
I'm losing propulsion control.

496
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,170
Can you see the van?

497
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,590
- Yeah.
- We'll catch you.

498
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,092
- You will?
- We will?

499
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,761
We will.

500
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,888
All right.

501
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,226
Keep it steady.

502
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,900
Unh. Whew.

503
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,276
The Atom lives.

504
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,364
- Argh.
- Oh.

505
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,659
Let's work on some softer gloves
for next time, okay?

506
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,410
Sorry.

507
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,871
Oh, you wanna bring it?

508
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,207
It's been brought.

509
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,752
Rude.

510
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,090
Felicity, right now would be a good time
to do something.

511
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,093
Stay away from Barry Allen.

512
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,765
- Felicity!
- Got it.

513
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,272
Boom. Drop the mike.

514
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,693
It's metaphorical, of course,
because I don't have a real mike.

515
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,700
Brie's restrained. Call C.C.P.D.

516
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,791
- Some kind of team you have here.
- It helps to have friends in your corner.

517
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,462
- That was like...
- This guy's a stunt driver.

518
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,143
Are you okay?

519
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,688
Cisco!

520
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,734
Come on, please.

521
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,944
Wake up.

522
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
Cisco has been stung.
He's going into shock.

523
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,448
I'm on my way.

524
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,199
Come on, stay with me.

525
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,164
Hold on, back up.

526
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,667
I'm gonna try something.

527
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,844
Cisco.

528
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,520
Either my fear of bees is over,
or it just got a lot worse.

529
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,565
Thank God you're okay.

530
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,942
I've never had anybody take a bee for me.

531
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,654
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, bro.

532
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,489
Cisco...

533
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,074
you're a hero, man.

534
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,838
- Dr. McGee.
- May I come in?

535
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,549
Yeah, of course. What can I do for you?

536
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,385
I wanted to apologize.

537
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,596
I should have listened to you
when you warned me about Brie.

538
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,058
Perhaps next time I will take
the C.C.P.D.'s offer of protection.

539
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,560
After we lost your tachyon prototype...

540
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,022
I can understand why you were hesitant
to trust us.

541
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,025
Thank you.

542
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,568
Can I ask you something?

543
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,408
I couldn't help but notice some tension...

544
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,868
between you and Dr. Wells.

545
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,204
That's all in the past.

546
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,582
Do you mind if I ask what happened
between you two?

547
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,088
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

548
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,591
Fifteen years ago,
Harrison and I were thick as thieves.

549
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,845
We were promising young scientists
in Starling City.

550
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,348
He was such a kind man.

551
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,684
Then everything changed after Tess died.

552
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,436
They were gonna get married.

553
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,939
I understand how grief can affect someone,
but this was more than that.

554
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,109
It was like after that day...

555
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,863
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

556
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,614
Good day.

557
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,075
Bye.

558
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,536
Doctor.

559
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,122
How's Cisco?

560
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,083
Happy to be alive.

561
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,129
And sad that Ray is leaving.

562
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:40,717
It was a really brave thing he did,
risking his life.

563
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,804
- Selfless.
- Yeah, definitely was.

564
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,398
And another end to another exciting
adventure in Central City.

565
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:59,652
- Ah. Yes. Thank you.
- Ray, thank you for all your help.

566
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,614
And I hope you figure out the problem
with your suit.

567
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,240
- I have.
- Oh.

568
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,160
All this time, I've been looking
at the power source the wrong way.

569
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,953
I kept thinking we needed to go bigger.

570
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,541
But the solution, as always,
is simply to go smaller.

571
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,294
Oh. Great.

572
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,923
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

573
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,009
I'm gonna be. Thank you for your advice.

574
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,136
Oh, I won't even charge you the 5 cents.

575
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,224
Bye, Felicity.

576
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,184
Bye, Barry.

577
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,656
Hey.

578
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,616
What's up?

579
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,328
um...

580
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,539
I spoke to Barry last night.

581
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,290
Oh, yeah?

582
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,211
He was trying to help me understand
why you've been so off lately.

583
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,006
Why you might be having trouble
connecting with me.

584
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,008
Really?

585
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,885
What did he say?

586
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,388
It was a good explanation.

587
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,223
Valid.

588
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,977
But the truth is, it doesn't matter.

589
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,480
Because when you love someone,
you tell them everything.

590
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:22,569
So if you love me, Eddie,
you'll tell me what is going on with you.

591
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,904
- Or...
- Or what?

592
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,574
You know what.

593
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,609
All right, all right.
Who's ready for some...

594
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,278
karaoke?

595
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,951
We are not going to karaoke, are we?

596
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,496
No. Um...

597
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,626
This is everything we know
about my mother's murder...

598
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,628
and the Reverse-Flash.

599
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,132
I've been gathering information on him
for a long time.

600
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,180
And this is everything we know
about Dr. Wells.

601
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,979
I don't understand.

602
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:44,567
What do Dr. Wells and the Reverse-Flash
have to do with each other?

603
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,486
Um...

604
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,406
They're the same person.

605
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,784
That's impossible.

606
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:58,581
Look, Caitlin,
it took me a long time to believe it too...

607
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,000
but it's him.

608
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,836
Dr. Wells is a speedster?

609
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,965
- He's paralyzed.
- Is he, though?

610
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,427
And why would he kill Barry's mother?

611
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,013
It doesn't make any sense.

612
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,268
Cisco? Say something.

613
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,607
I've been having these dreams.

614
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,278
Mostly at night
but sometimes during the day.

615
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,533
But they don't really feel
like dreams. They...

616
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,452
They feel real.

617
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,541
What happens in the dream?

618
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,461
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

619
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,968
And he kills me.

620
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:59,992
