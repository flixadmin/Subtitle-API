1
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:01,777
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,262
You and I dating would be totally weird.

3
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:04,264
Totally weird.

4
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:06,412
Hank is running some secret project.

5
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:08,970
A man came to me, Neron.
He offered me a deal.

6
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:11,051
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

7
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,494
I have a new partner now. My son.

8
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,760
I don't need you anymore.

9
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,547
I don't need you anymore, either.

10
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,041
- Dad?
- I'm sorry.

11
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,425
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

12
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:22,920
Sara, you're asking
me to risk everything

13
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,256
for some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters?

14
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,984
- Ava, don't do this.
- I'm done.

15
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,052
Ava and I didn't just
get into an argument.

16
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,821
She asked me to leave.

17
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,603
Come on, Ava, open up.

18
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:45,252
Look, I... I miss you.

19
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,904
And I'm sorry things went
down the way they did,

20
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:50,573
but please just open the door.

21
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,180
Well, technically this
is still our apartment.

22
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,131
Ava.

23
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:13,947
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

24
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,640
So I was saying...

25
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,068
Nora, what are you doing here?

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,788
- Uh, I can explain.
- I can explain.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,765
I didn't kill Hank, it was a demon.

28
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:24,866
Yeah, I know. His name is Neron

29
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:26,985
and he's wearing Desmond
as a bleeding suit.

30
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,204
- Ray!
- Sara! Great news.

31
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,489
Hank was killed by a demon.

32
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:32,664
"Great" was not the
word he was looking for.

33
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,876
- Poor Nate.
- Look, Ava is missing.

34
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,386
- Missing?
- I... I should have

35
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,888
- checked on her sooner.
- It's Neron.

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,455
He has his sights set on the Time Bureau

37
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:40,966
and the creatures,
and if he got to Hank,

38
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,708
then dingdongs to donuts, Ava was next.

39
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,004
- Hey, she is not dead.
- Listen, when Neron

40
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,890
was out the Bureau, he
and I shared a connection.

41
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:50,196
If you can take me to Ava's place,

42
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:51,634
I might be able to
know where he took her.

43
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:52,950
Demons communicate,

44
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:55,299
he'll know your past,
how susceptible you are.

45
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:56,472
You're a liability.

46
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:59,350
She's not a liability. She's a survivor.

47
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,994
Unlike you, she's turned
her dark experiences

48
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,571
into a source of strength,

49
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,657
not an excuse for
alcoholism or chain smoking.

50
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,150
She also saved your life.

51
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,538
Sorry. Would you like to add anything?

52
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,036
No, that about covers it.

53
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,339
I don't care if she's a liability.

54
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,199
If Neron has Ava, then I need

55
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,492
all the magical
firepower that we've got.

56
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:19,204
You two with me. Woman the ship.

57
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,478
This is from two weeks ago.

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,338
Oh...

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,217
She's been gone a tick. That's not good.

60
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,385
Yeah, thanks.

61
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:45,021
- There.
- What? What do you see?

62
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,617
He had her. Here.

63
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:55,031
- Ava...
- That doesn't mean she's dead.

64
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,033
It doesn't mean she's alive, either.

65
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,216
I know where she is.

66
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,430
Conspiracies, embezzling,
paper trails...

67
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,527
I feel like Julia Roberts
in "Erin Brockovich."

68
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,726
We're more Pacific
Gas and Electric, Gary.

69
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:26,229
- Wait, we're the bad guys?
- I don't know who we are,

70
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,825
Gary, all right? We're
the guys trying to keep

71
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:31,109
my dad's cracked out
idea of Jur-magic Park

72
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,944
from tanking the Time Bureau. All right?

73
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,313
So anything that has to do
with Heyworld, get rid of it!

74
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,425
How am I gonna explain all
this to Director Sharpe?

75
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,618
Actually, Ava's missing.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,600
I knew it. I knew it, you
know, I had a dream about her

77
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,607
where she was driving and I
was in a car seat in the back.

78
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,330
- We were headed to Schul.
- Gary.

79
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,886
She needs me.

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,505
I got... I got...

81
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:55,016
Sara, Constantine, and
Nora are... looking for her.

82
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,361
- Nora?
- Look, she didn't kill Hank.

83
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,470
- Come on, man.
- Just listen, okay?

84
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,433
Your dad made a deal
with a demon named Neron.

85
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:07,312
I guess something went wrong
and the demon killed him.

86
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,814
I'm sorry, buddy.

87
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,585
My dad made a deal with a demon

88
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,593
to open a theme park?

89
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,712
Oh, Ray,

90
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,139
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, man.

91
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:33,171
- Is that you?
- No.

92
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,060
If this is my dad's mistress,

93
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm gonna jump out a window.

94
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:45,033
- Hello?
- Yo, Mr. H., it's Mikey T.

95
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,736
Listen, got a question for
you about the dragon lair.

96
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,946
Could sure use your eyes down here.

97
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:52,023
Uh, do-down where?

98
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:56,077
- What? Here, at the site.
- Uh, Buckwood Downs?

99
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,672
- Uh, yeah, where else?
- Talk to you later.

100
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,248
Who was it?

101
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,116
I don't know, he sounded like a Soprano,

102
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,720
but apparently my dad started
building this theme park.

103
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,849
The guys who were working with him,

104
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,879
maybe they know
something about this Neron

105
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,927
a-and why he killed my dad.

106
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,264
Come on! I'm Steel, you're The Atom.

107
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,191
There is nothing we cannot handle!

108
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,267
This one.

109
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,189
Ava?

110
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,616
Hey.

111
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,877
Ava.

112
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,453
She's alive.

113
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,125
- What did he do to her?
- He's preparing her.

114
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,369
Neron must be looking for a new vessel.

115
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,932
It only makes sense going after Ava,

116
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,248
especially if he wants
control over the Time Bureau.

117
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,916
But when a demon possesses someone,

118
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,085
the body has to be
willing, and if it's not,

119
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,804
the demon has to force his way in

120
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:58,065
by sending the soul to purgatory.

121
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,141
That's where the real fight begins.

122
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,592
How do we save her?

123
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,429
Some souls go up and some go down.

124
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,240
But if she's been there
as long as she has,

125
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,725
then she's not coming back, Sara.

126
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm not giving up on her, John.

127
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,764
You're going to send me
to purgatory to get her.

128
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:14,887
If I send you down there with her,

129
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,482
there's nothing that I
can do to protect you.

130
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,234
- I'll take my chances.
- This isn't something

131
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,944
you can just fight
your way through, love.

132
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,589
John, please!

133
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,501
Fine.

134
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,916
Lay down.

135
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,773
Our purgatory is designed

136
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,942
to drive the soul to breaking point.

137
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,883
It's tailored to drive the captive mad.

138
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,762
Now where you're going,

139
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,116
that's Ava's personal nightmare.

140
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,285
I've died, lost my soul,
and escaped a demon realm.

141
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,372
I'm pretty sure I can
handle Ava's purgatory.

142
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,151
Well, prepare for the worst, Sara Lance.

143
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,512
Welcome.

144
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,122
Do you need a bag?

145
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,400
I gotta get out of here.

146
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:33,568
I can't do this anymore.

147
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,529
I just gotta get out of here.

148
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,907
Ava!

149
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,910
Hey. Hey.

150
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:45,630
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, my God.

151
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,824
- Sara, is that really you?
- It's me. I got you.

152
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,419
What the hell happened? Am I dead?

153
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,496
You were kidnapped by a demon

154
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,373
and he's trying to take over your body

155
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,709
so he trapped your soul here
in your own personal purgatory.

156
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,430
But Ava, if you check out, you die.

157
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,174
Well, that's kind of
on the nose, isn't it?

158
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,953
Wait, does that mean
that he got you too?

159
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,862
No.

160
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,698
I'm taking you home.

161
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:20,121
I got it! Natari!

162
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,499
I'm gonna regret asking
this, but what's that?

163
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,502
It's your couple's name. Nat for Nate

164
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,521
and of course Ari is for you.

165
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,023
You know I'm a superhero, right?

166
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,983
With a flick of my
wrist I could blast you

167
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,133
with my wind powers.

168
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,527
Being honest, wind powers,

169
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,719
just not that scary.

170
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,898
Yeah,

171
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,348
you're like a magical hair dryer.

172
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,534
What is this? "Legends
Eye for the Straight Guy"?

173
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,412
- You're straight?
- Where's Sara?

174
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:46,064
Uh, she's with Constantine
and Nora, trying to find Ava.

175
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,316
Actually, they've just
returned, and Mr. Constantine

176
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,957
has called a team meeting in the lab.

177
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,745
- He can do that?
- No.

178
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:52,880
Let's go, dummies.

179
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:03,331
- Ava's in hell?
- She's not in hell.

180
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,185
Her soul is trapped in limbo.

181
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,062
And I am right there with her.

182
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,838
- Oh, Gary.
- Emotionally.

183
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,293
Poor Director Sharpe.

184
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:13,567
I've sent Sara down there
to try and pull her out.

185
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:16,645
- I thought that they broke up.
- She still loves her.

186
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,389
- What can we do?
- Sara chose to go in after her

187
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,391
so unless praying is your thing,

188
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,059
then the best thing you can do is wait.

189
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,562
You don't have to worry.

190
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,623
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Uh...

191
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,359
- Oh, he's all right.
- I'll take good care of her.

192
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,111
Them.

193
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,405
All right, Charlie, you're with me

194
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,532
- This should be interesting.
- Let's go find out what

195
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,584
this demon wants, shall we?

196
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,076
- You up for it?
- Mm.

197
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,954
All right then, let's raise some hell.

198
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,295
Oh, how you doing? Can I help you guys?

199
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:55,183
Yeah, we're looking
for Mr.... Uh, Mr. T.

200
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,302
Who's asking? 'Cause no one's allowed

201
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,596
on this site unle...

202
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:03,052
Hey, I know you. I'd recognize
that Heywood jaw line anywhere.

203
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,786
You must be "And Son."

204
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,772
You kidding me? Hank is
always going on about you.

205
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,650
Where... where is he?

206
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,703
- Hank passed.
- What?

207
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:16,946
Jeez, I... sorry to hear that.

208
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,782
You mind if we take a look around?

209
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,135
Hey, it's all yours now, kid.

210
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,879
Question: did my dad ever mention

211
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,498
a man by the name of Neron?

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,667
Neron? What is that, Greek?

213
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,461
No, it's Demonic... Danish, actually.

214
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,647
No, never heard of the guy.

215
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,073
A-actually, to be honest with you,

216
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:36,438
Hank didn't really tell me a lot.

217
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:38,908
All he gave me was... was this.

218
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,097
We're building that right
now. A unicorn rodeo.

219
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,763
Can you imagine? Two unicorns jousting?

220
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:47,018
I'd rather not.

221
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,905
Hey, come here, come here.

222
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:52,482
This. This is what I was
calling you guys about.

223
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,910
- About the, uh...
- Dragon lair.

224
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:58,154
Yeah, I know. I drew it.

225
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,132
- I drew all of this.
- Great, tell me something.

226
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,700
Look at this. See this
here? What is this?

227
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,992
Is this supposed to be real flame,

228
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,703
or were you thinking, like, plexi?

229
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,330
'Cause I got a guy that can
do fire. Like forget about it.

230
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,012
I can't believe he did it.

231
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,889
I know you and your dad struggled

232
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,858
and even if you got your wires crossed,

233
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,628
you never stopped trying to connect.

234
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:31,020
I just hope my dad knew I loved him.

235
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:34,016
Oh, he knew. Look at this place.

236
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,151
You know, I just wish
he would have found

237
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,379
a better way to, you
know, tell me he loved me.

238
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,518
One that didn't involve
teaming up with a demon

239
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,216
and embezzling money
from the government.

240
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:45,794
It's a bit much.

241
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,372
Mikey T! Mikey T!

242
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,134
Change of plans.

243
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:54,419
Tear it down.

244
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:58,047
The dragon lair?

245
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,092
The whole thing.

246
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:05,054
Waiting sucks.

247
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:07,816
Ooh, sexting Nate?

248
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:11,987
- Boundaries, Mona.
- I need vicarious feels.

249
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,897
There are more important things

250
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,775
to focus on right now and
Nate's got a lot going on.

251
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,028
- It's not the right time.
- What are you typing?

252
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,748
- Hey, what's up?
- Ugh...

253
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,383
Okay, I don't even know why I'm talking

254
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,785
to you two about it. You
don't even date humans.

255
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,547
Love's love.

256
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:37,754
Whatever you need, I'm here.

257
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,134
Whatever you need, I'm here.

258
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,612
Why is Gary in your subconscious?

259
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,839
I may have some Gary issues
that need working out.

260
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:50,734
Okay, we just... we need to
find the door that you came in.

261
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,278
Does any of this look familiar?

262
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,145
No, it all looks exactly the same.

263
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,439
Why don't we just try to
follow the arrows back?

264
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,762
Maybe they'll take us to the entrance.

265
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,251
Reminder, shoppers,

266
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:01,504
the store will be closing in one hour.

267
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:03,534
Constantine didn't say
anything about that.

268
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:04,739
What does it mean?

269
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,468
It means we take shortcuts. Come on.

270
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,833
- Hello, again, ladies.
- Damn it.

271
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,168
- Okay, this way.
- No!

272
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,505
Or we could just ask Gary.
How do we get to the entrance?

273
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,632
Oh...

274
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,301
We're not really allowed
to give that kind of advice.

275
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:30,732
- Come on...
- But, the Ergrik wardrobe

276
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,184
might be just the thing
you're looking for.

277
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,085
Looks like the wardrobe section.

278
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,029
Oh.

279
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:47,198
Now what?

280
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,705
I think we're supposed
to put it together.

281
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,016
No sweat.

282
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,352
Here.

283
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:02,189
Wait, wait, wait. Step
one, insert the dowel.

284
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:06,193
- Here, babe.
- I got this.

285
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:13,390
Shut up, man! What
you gonna do about it?

286
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,992
You kidding me? Why, you brain-damaged?

287
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,889
Papa's home.

288
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:38,392
Miss me?

289
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,751
I missed you.

290
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:46,424
We'll be together soon, my pet.

291
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:49,236
Not bloody likely.

292
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,360
Oh, Nora.

293
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,913
Ah!

294
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:32,285
There's nowhere for you to
run now, you bile bladder.

295
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:35,289
Me, run? You're the one who ran.

296
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,200
All I had to do was say,
"I'm coming for you, Johnny."

297
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,537
And you left 2018 to me.

298
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,207
It's delicious how easily
humans are corrupted,

299
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,701
- especially here in D.C.
- So that's your game?

300
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:49,980
You inflict fear and anger on humanity?

301
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,997
I merely fan the flames.

302
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:54,475
People are primed to give
in to what they fear most.

303
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,653
You know what, mate? I
am going to send your ass

304
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,387
straight back to hell.

305
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,983
- John, this isn't the plan.
- Nora, we finally get to talk.

306
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:05,302
Hope you've enjoyed your little
dalliances inside my mind.

307
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:09,064
But it's not a one way street. Is it, Nora?

308
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,807
- Ugh...
- I knew you were a liability.

309
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,160
We should be off with him.

310
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:13,903
You're playing right
into his hands, John.

311
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,354
You're the one who can't handle this.

312
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,689
Oh, yes, says Miss-Lock-Herself-Up

313
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,483
because she can't handle her own demons.

314
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,837
Well, this is me
handling mine, all right?

315
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,990
Out!

316
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,851
- He's getting to you.
- Oh, he's getting to me?

317
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:35,499
- Yeah.
- He's inside your head.

318
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,311
What, you don't think I
haven't seen you struggling?

319
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,230
Humanity hasn't exactly been
kind to you, has it, Nora?

320
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,423
You're addicted to this kind of power,

321
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,563
and believe me, it doesn't go away.

322
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,220
No it doesn't and it hasn't
been easy, but if I can trust

323
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:51,056
myself, I don't think it's too
much to ask for you to try too.

324
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:54,076
Oh, it's killing you
to look at his face.

325
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:55,444
I know how hard it is to watch

326
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,038
someone you love become a demon.

327
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,064
Yeah, well too bad there
aren't any Beebos around

328
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,732
to hug it to death.

329
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:10,218
We can't just keep him locked
up in there, driving us all mad.

330
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,910
Yeah, well, I think
between the two of us,

331
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:15,080
we can figure something out.

332
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,894
Ta-dah!

333
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,898
- Damn it.
- What a surprise.

334
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,633
You followed none of the
instructions and it didn't work.

335
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:29,101
I'm sensing that this
isn't about the dresser.

336
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,762
No, this is what you always do.

337
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:33,010
- Just bulldoze your way though.
- I do not always do this.

338
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,516
Like lying to me about the Kaupe?

339
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,078
You were defending torturing creatures.

340
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,398
Defen... I wasn't defending
it. I was defending myself.

341
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,825
Of course I don't believe that we should

342
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,888
be intentionally hurting
anything or anyone

343
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:46,328
but when we fight, Sara,

344
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,740
I get really scared, and
I just go to my corner.

345
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,119
Look, it's just fight or flight.

346
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,455
It couldn't be any more human.

347
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,124
I just really need to know
that you're on my team.

348
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,680
I am always on your team,

349
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,715
even when we disagree.

350
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:12,280
Now, should we give it another go?

351
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,028
Thank you.

352
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:29,297
- Ah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

353
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,491
See? Following instructions
is not that bad.

354
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,968
Oh, don't gloat.

355
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,303
Let's get out of here.

356
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,498
Something's wrong.

357
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,550
Did we miss a screw or something?

358
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:42,834
No...

359
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:46,672
- We missed this.
- It's...

360
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:49,317
How the hell did we
possibly miss this? Damn it.

361
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,054
Hey, look. It's not
perfect, but it's ours.

362
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:56,306
Can you live with that?

363
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,974
Hey?

364
00:18:57,976 --> 00:18:59,476
Don't go in your corner.

365
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,275
Yeah, I can live with it.

366
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,155
Hell yeah. Let's go to Narnia.

367
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:15,918
Are we out?

368
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,462
We're out of the closet
but not the store.

369
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:19,505
Touché.

370
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,422
Welcome to our mattress showroom.

371
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:22,874
If you'll follow me?

372
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:25,043
The mattress you choose will be the most

373
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,096
important decision of your life.

374
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:30,716
Wait, you're showing
them the mattresses?

375
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:33,694
We need everyone out
before Tabitha gets here.

376
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,011
Who the hell is Tabitha?

377
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,939
You don't want to know Tabitha.

378
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,736
Best of luck in your mattress choice.

379
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,902
- Wait, we need to...
- Gary, wait...

380
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:43,204
This is starting to feel
like that escape room we did.

381
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:45,897
Okay, so, subconscious Gary
said this would be the most

382
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:48,066
important choice of our life.
What do you think that means?

383
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,544
That even subconscious
Gary needs to get a life?

384
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,612
No, it's a puzzle. Do
you... what does it mean?

385
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,030
Do you think we need to...

386
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,575
It means we need to pick a mattress.

387
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,795
- How about this one?
- What?

388
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,747
Oh.

389
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,257
Whoa, 600 bucks? That is ridiculously...

390
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,030
- Three-year warranty?
- Expensive, right?

391
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,796
I was thinking, like, $250.

392
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:10,973
Wha... Are you kidding?

393
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:12,591
It would be saggy in like a year.

394
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,476
So you just flip it over.

395
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,645
You just flip it over?
Is that what you do

396
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,739
when things get saggy,
you just flip 'em over

397
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:21,775
so you don't have to
look at their saggy faces?

398
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,057
Okay.

399
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:34,422
How about this one? Fifteen years.

400
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,259
Oh, that's better.

401
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,753
Oh, when did you start going grey?

402
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:43,764
Whoa. This place has
been really stressful.

403
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,333
Yeah.

404
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,085
Ugh!

405
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:51,797
I think it's the mattress.

406
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,225
Apparently your purgatory
is your anxieties.

407
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:58,804
One of which must be getting old.

408
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:02,265
I'm not worried about getting old, Sara.

409
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:04,702
I'm worried about getting old with you.

410
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,371
So we're...

411
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:20,301
talking about marriage.

412
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:22,386
Um...

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,583
Wow.

414
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:33,255
You look, um, still really hot but...

415
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,983
You too.

416
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:39,224
Oh, well, 50 years is a long time

417
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:42,639
sleeping on one mattress.

418
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,233
It sure is.

419
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,977
Look, I know it's a lot.

420
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:50,072
50 years with just one person.

421
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:52,315
Well, it's... it's not
the one person thing.

422
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:55,077
I just... Look, I've
never really thought

423
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,413
that much past tomorrow.

424
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:01,083
Ava, with my past,

425
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,702
planning anything for
the future is just...

426
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,871
Feels like tempting fate.

427
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:09,708
And I convinced myself
that I like it that way.

428
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,352
Until you came along.

429
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,024
You just freaking came
to purgatory for me.

430
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,801
How's that for giving
the middle finger to fate?

431
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:24,398
Look, you're allowed to
want things sometimes, Sara.

432
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,103
But what if I can't be
the person that you need?

433
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,898
Let's be honest, neither
of us needs anybody.

434
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,333
Right?

435
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:37,903
But you are who I want.

436
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,370
I bet you there's some
good liquor in Ava's office.

437
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:50,373
I mean, my dad's old office.

438
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,543
Oh, man. Things are bleak.

439
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:57,773
Hey, Ray, thanks for
sticking around here.

440
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:00,901
Yeah, buddy, of course.
That's what friends are for.

441
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:03,887
I just wish I wasn't such
an idiot at my dad's funeral.

442
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,407
I had a chance to talk
to him, but I blew it.

443
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,976
Now I'll never know what happened.

444
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,201
Well, maybe Constantine
can get you some answers.

445
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:14,790
- Looks like they caught Neron.
- Son of a bitch.

446
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:19,494
Is that the demon who killed my dad?

447
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:20,746
Whoa, there, Squire.

448
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,026
You take it easy, all right?

449
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:23,257
Nate, you don't want to go in there.

450
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:24,783
- Just walk away.
- No.

451
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:27,428
- Not a chance.
- Wait! Wait!

452
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,267
Hello, Nathaniel.

453
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:35,844
I've heard so much about you.

454
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:40,707
So predictable. The son, who,

455
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,871
in life, could never
connect with the father.

456
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:45,009
Here now, seeking the truth.

457
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:46,803
Well, here it is.

458
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:51,706
Hank was an unfortunate snag in my plans

459
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,310
so I...

460
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:58,272
- You evil bastard.
- Yeah. Demon.

461
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,577
Nate's already angry,

462
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,861
makes him prime pickings for Neron.

463
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,005
No, he'll be all right.

464
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:06,239
As long as he doesn't cross

465
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,991
that bloody barrier. Ahh!

466
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:12,153
Why? He built your theme
park just like you wanted.

467
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:14,497
You think I wanted a theme park?

468
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,183
I gave Hank power

469
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:18,501
and in return, he was to supply me

470
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:20,929
with fear mongering magical creatures

471
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:24,358
to terrorize people into
giving up their souls.

472
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,511
Instead, he went behind my back
and built some deranged zoo.

473
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,888
He betrayed me

474
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,765
- because of you.
- No.

475
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,685
If you'd had just stayed out of our way,

476
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:39,772
maybe your old man would still be alive.

477
00:24:39,774 --> 00:24:41,909
Nate, no wait!

478
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:50,792
Ray, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

479
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:53,333
It's okay, buddy, I know it wasn't you.

480
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:05,047
Ohh.

481
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:11,238
It's locked.

482
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:16,576
Uhh, there's nothing to build.

483
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:19,821
No furniture to choose.

484
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:23,825
Dishes. Piece of cake. Go, go, go.

485
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:27,403
Yeah, this seems more
like one of your fantasies

486
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:29,256
than your fears, watching me do dishes.

487
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:30,999
Please, if it were up to you,

488
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:32,450
we would only have paper plates. Here.

489
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,120
You on that?

490
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:37,889
- Got it.
- Hm.

491
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,896
I'm on it.

492
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:55,973
It never ends.

493
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,286
- Did you send it?
- Honestly, mate,

494
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,362
whatever happened to
just talking to someone?

495
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:04,982
Emoji's are way more fun
and if he's not that into it,

496
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:07,485
you can pretend like you were
talking about something else.

497
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:10,112
Right. Nate's gonna think
I was dying to tell him

498
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:14,408
about a dancing lady
carrying a burning eggplant.

499
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,953
Here, use words.

500
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:20,331
It's erotic but vulnerable.

501
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,999
Okay, let me see it.

502
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:28,598
I'm not saying "bulge."

503
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,010
Sula the Wolf Witch talked
about smothering a demon.

504
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:35,489
Does that make sense to you?

505
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:39,567
When Mallus was a part of
me I could feel his fear.

506
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,737
He was vulnerable here on Earth.

507
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,998
- It made him nervous.
- So if we can separate

508
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,398
the demon from his earthly vessel,

509
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,169
it will suffocate him.

510
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,153
Just like a fish out of water.

511
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:54,323
Why are you even working
with that arrogant dick?

512
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:57,344
He'll never value your true power.

513
00:26:57,346 --> 00:26:59,328
Not like I will.

514
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,547
You all right there, love?

515
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,978
Yeah. I just need some coffee.

516
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,585
I'm fine.

517
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:09,338
- And I'm sober.
- Hey. Are you okay?

518
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,691
I'm all right.

519
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:14,635
Thanks.

520
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:17,889
You best let her alone, Squire.

521
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:27,565
This is all your mail! You deal with it.

522
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,528
It's not like you have an
address to even get mail, so.

523
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,698
We both talked about it and agreed

524
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,534
that now wasn't the right time
for me to move in with you.

525
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:40,325
- But we're making it work.
- Are we?

526
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:41,681
Because how I see it,

527
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:44,373
we're living completely
separate lives, so.

528
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,227
Ava, I want this, just,
when the time is right.

529
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,062
Timing doesn't just happen, Sara.

530
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:50,605
Okay, you have to make a choice.

531
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:53,257
So what? This? This is what you want?

532
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,478
No, of course. Nobody just
wants dirty dishes but, yes.

533
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,222
Ava, we are time-traveling superheroes.

534
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:02,409
Okay, fine, but I'm not just my job.

535
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:05,987
I want some hobbies. I
want... I want a life with you.

536
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:09,732
And sometimes life is... Is just this.

537
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,233
Okay? It's boring.

538
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,218
What then? You off
to the next adventure?

539
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:16,317
No! But I can't just
decide every single moment

540
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,258
of forever right this instant.

541
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,079
So please just tell me what you
want me to say and I'll say it

542
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,623
and we can get out of here.

543
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,100
I can't tell you what to say, Sara,

544
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:30,303
because then it wouldn't mean anything.

545
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:33,106
Okay, well.

546
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:35,299
Let's just... let's move

547
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:39,779
to the suburbs and we'll
just recycle until we die.

548
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,013
Can we go now?

549
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,653
Oh, no.

550
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,305
It's just me.

551
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:24,866
Let's talk.

552
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,977
I've admired your power

553
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,312
for a long time, Nora.

554
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,647
I don't take compliments

555
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,273
from people who frame me for murder.

556
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,626
All in the interest
of self-preservation.

557
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,736
You understand.

558
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:44,173
Do they even know
what you're capable of?

559
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:46,584
- They have no idea.
- Then why waste your time

560
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:49,953
with that arrogant bastard
and his pathetic delusion

561
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,830
that the world needs him to save it?

562
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,517
When I met John, I was just a kid.

563
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,644
He was kind.

564
00:29:57,647 --> 00:30:00,148
Mallus wanted me, but I wasn't ready.

565
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,508
But I'll tell you this.

566
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,394
John did everything he could to save me.

567
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:15,404
But when he failed, he abandoned me.

568
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,150
John knew what the
Order were doing to me

569
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,860
and he just let them.

570
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,415
And he's the one who
decides who to send to hell.

571
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,703
Cocky cowboy wearing his
hangover like a ten-gallon hat.

572
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,347
He might have won that last battle,

573
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,164
but the war is mine.

574
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,594
My Tabitha will be free
soon and when she is,

575
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:41,171
we're gonna put John away for good.

576
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:46,027
Tabitha? That's why you
needed Ava as a vessel.

577
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,872
There's a model for everyone.

578
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:00,357
Are you looking for one to clean?

579
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,212
One to keep you safe?
One to... please you?

580
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:06,572
No, you creep.

581
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,907
I'm looking for Ava.

582
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,126
They're all Ava.

583
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:13,796
No, they're not.

584
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,873
Just remember, pick quickly.

585
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,299
Tabitha will be here soon

586
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:19,084
and once she's here...

587
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,339
Oh, no.

588
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,759
Once she's here, what?

589
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:33,557
Attention, the store will
be closing in five minutes.

590
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:41,323
I can't believe I got my dad killed.

591
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:44,160
No, it was Hank's choice
to make a deal with a demon.

592
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:45,753
That is not your fault.

593
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:50,166
You spending time with him inspired him.

594
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:54,077
Made him happy. I don't
think you doomed him.

595
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,746
I think you saved him.

596
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:05,672
Here's to the man you
helped your dad become.

597
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,984
You know what, Ray? You're right.

598
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:10,594
I shouldn't be embarrassed,
I should be proud.

599
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,115
Yeah, my dad was a little wacky,
but most of the good ones are.

600
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:17,785
He was a Legend and he
should be remembered that way.

601
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,957
Ah!

602
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,201
Mikey T!

603
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:26,794
I got to stop him.

604
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,299
Sara will never let you take Ava.

605
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:33,801
If not her, I'll find someone else.

606
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,624
You know, I can bring back other people.

607
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,144
Damien misses you so much.

608
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:50,801
- You can bring my father...
- Of course.

609
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,488
Now be a lamb and let me out,

610
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,056
Nora, doll.

611
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,994
You know, you can't
just walk out of here.

612
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:03,239
Constantine will never let you do that.

613
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:05,983
Maybe as Desmond.

614
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,527
But if you let me in,

615
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,671
you, with my power?

616
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:13,341
Nobody could stop us.

617
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:16,460
The monitors were
wonky. Are you all right?

618
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:19,496
Of course. You shut them down.

619
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,182
I should have never trusted you.

620
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:27,263
Shut up, John.

621
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,349
Attention: the store will
be closing in two minutes.

622
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:44,613
Where is she?

623
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,398
None of these are Ava.

624
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,334
I'm not leaving without her!

625
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,256
Ava.

626
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:17,016
But you could have chosen
any one of those other women.

627
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,890
I don't want other women.

628
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,076
But I'm...

629
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:40,535
- Hey.
- Oh.

630
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,691
Hey.

631
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,998
You did it.

632
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,458
No.

633
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,970
We did it.

634
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,681
- We did it!
- Jeez.

635
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,596
Let's do this.

636
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,570
Nora.

637
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,080
Now!

638
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:32,963
Vessel... what a pretty word for victim.

639
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,942
Oh, I don't need your power, Neron.

640
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,342
I have my own.

641
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,802
We've got him.

642
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,304
Oh, just a few minutes more.

643
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,931
Nora!

644
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,659
Ray, no!

645
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,340
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

646
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:09,878
It's okay. It's okay, mate.

647
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,501
It's all right.

648
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,794
Where am I?

649
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,212
You're safe.

650
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,564
Nora?

651
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,862
Nora?

652
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,419
Eggplant's a little obvious.

653
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:30,275
I say you go with mushroom. Mushroom...

654
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:31,736
Ava!

655
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,345
You're back from the dead.

656
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:35,138
- I knew you'd do it, Captain.
- Uh, gently.

657
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,992
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, nice job, boss.

658
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,243
Okay, serious, which emojis like...

659
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,954
All right, enough with the emoji.

660
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,332
Hey!

661
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,406
Just leave while you
can. You should just...

662
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,794
Okay...

663
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:48,026
You know, we should probably talk about

664
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:49,486
whether or not we want kids.

665
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:51,080
Eh, let's wait until the other eight

666
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:53,082
are old enough to handle the news.

667
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:55,176
I don't even know what
this text means anymore.

668
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:57,661
"You up? Hot dog, donut, thumbs up."

669
00:36:57,663 --> 00:36:59,713
Well, you wanna snog him, yeah?

670
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:02,183
Or do you want him to get diabetes?

671
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:06,220
Okay, this doesn't sound like me at all.

672
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:07,855
You like him and he likes you,

673
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:09,023
just tell him that.

674
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:15,196
Okay, uh...

675
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:19,725
"Want to go out sometime...

676
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:24,855
... On a date"?

677
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,618
Oh, yeah. See? That wasn't so bad.

678
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,420
Now, it's all on Nate.

679
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,716
Oh, God.

680
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,626
Oh, God, what did I do?

681
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:49,087
Mikey, pick up. Mikey, pick up.

682
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,233
You can just drop that down.
You're not gonna need it.

683
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,150
No. Mikey, no!

684
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:02,410
Mikey!

685
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:04,436
Mikey, stop!

686
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,857
Zari?

687
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,951
Ha!

688
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:22,662
Is that you, And Son?

689
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:24,932
I changed my mind.

690
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,977
What are you doing? You
should have just called.

691
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:29,437
Jeez.

692
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,538
I knew I should have
synced to the stupid cloud.

693
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:39,613
Nate.

694
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:42,399
- Hey.
- Hi, uh...

695
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,976
So, um, uh, about...

696
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:46,051
About that text...

697
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:47,377
Oh, yeah, um...

698
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,480
My phone had an unfortunate run-in with

699
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,774
a wrecking-ball, so, uh...

700
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:52,067
Oh, my God.

701
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,318
That sucks.

702
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,529
What'd you wanna talk about?

703
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:57,489
I... I... I just wanted
to let you know that

704
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:00,417
Sara and Ava... they're good.

705
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,179
- That's great!
- Yeah.

706
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,699
Anything else you wanna talk about?

707
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:09,551
No, no, not that I can think of.

708
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:11,670
Okay. Cool, cool, cool.

709
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:13,147
Glah... yeah, bye.

710
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,431
Bye.

711
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,609
- Zari...
- Bye.

712
00:39:20,782 --> 00:39:22,305
Hello?

713
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:24,825
Is there anyone here
who can call me a cab?

714
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:26,235
Anything you need, mate.

715
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:27,903
I can get you a flight to New Orleans,

716
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:29,663
anywhere in the world, you name it.

717
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,832
No.

718
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:34,609
I don't want anything from you.

719
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:37,737
I'm not asking for forgiveness, Des.

720
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,081
Good.

721
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,383
Just wait... wait, Des.

722
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:45,495
You saved me, Johnny.

723
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:49,040
I'm grateful for that.

724
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,751
But it doesn't change anything.

725
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:53,762
I know.

726
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:56,732
You know I can make it all go away, Des.

727
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,859
This will make you forget.

728
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,904
No.

729
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:06,158
You sent me to hell.

730
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:12,731
That's something we're both
gonna have to live with.

731
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,888
How's she holding up, old son?

732
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,458
She's stable, but unresponsive.

733
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,710
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

734
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:35,229
I couldn't let her get hurt again.

735
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:38,048
Oh, yeah, well, you just
rolled straight in there

736
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,902
like a knight in shining armor
and nearly got her killed.

737
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:43,195
I didn't mean to.

738
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,574
Yeah, I know.

739
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:52,395
She's a brave lass,
nearly cost her her life.

740
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:54,623
But she killed that bloody demon.

741
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,442
She's amazing.

742
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:16,169
We'll get you out of this one, Nora.

743
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,647
I'm not gonna abandon you again.

744
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,488
Whoa.

745
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,723
It's okay, boy.

746
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:30,359
Dogs usually love me.

747
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:46,463
