1
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:13,296
Barry, please!

2
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:15,932
That's not me!

3
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:23,714
This can't be happening.

4
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,566
Are you real?

5
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,260
No, of course you're not.

6
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,267
That's it. That's it.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,315
I've finally lost it.

8
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,659
It's okay. I-I'm real.

9
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:43,251
Oh, my...

10
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,163
I...

11
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:50,425
Oh, I-I...

12
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,835
I can't believe I'm
talking to another person.

13
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:55,036
It's been so long.

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,370
Wait, I know you...

15
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,016
you and your husband, Joseph Carver,

16
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:59,675
you founded McCulloch Technologies.

17
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:02,211
You're Eva McCulloch.

18
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,680
But you're supposed to be dead.

19
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,590
No.

20
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,351
Not dead.

21
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,094
Just trapped.

22
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,765
Now so are you.

23
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:34,376
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

24
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,638
You see, until now, this
place was a whole world

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,250
with one inhabitant...

26
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,311
- Me.
- This must be another Earth.

27
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,046
Same Earth. Another dimension.

28
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,483
You see, a mirror-version
of Central City.

29
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:52,362
Same city, same buildings, just empty.

30
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,767
Who are you anyway?

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,219
I'm Iris West-Allen.

32
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm a reporter for "The CC Citizen."

33
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:02,909
Never heard of it.

34
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,728
Not that it matters.

35
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,741
God, it feels so good
to have a conversation

36
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,986
that's not one-sided.

37
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,048
Everything is backwards.

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,490
Eva, you said that this place

39
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,837
was a mirror-version of our own.

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,995
How is that possible?

41
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:20,848
Think of it like this:

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,333
our reality is observed
by three dimensions:

43
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,927
width, depth, and length.

44
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,521
The superstring theory posits

45
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,029
that there are other realities,

46
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:32,080
fractal dimensions humans can't see.

47
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,175
So...

48
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:36,345
Two sides.

49
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,348
One, our world.

50
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,120
The other is just some empty reflection.

51
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:45,822
I'm a quantum engineer.

52
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,734
It's... it's my wheelhouse.

53
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,835
Yeah, that is a side-effect
of this dimension.

54
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:01,556
I... I barely notice them anymore.

55
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,917
How did you end up here, Eva?

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,543
Six years ago,

57
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,764
I was developing the technology

58
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,308
to open doors to other
planes of existence.

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,301
I was in my office

60
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:17,897
the night Harrison Wells'
dream went up in smoke.

61
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,776
I've been here ever since.

62
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,903
Dark matter must have
washed over that mirror

63
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,922
and created a doorway.

64
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,758
I was in this office
when I got pulled in too.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,692
But that's not all.

66
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,054
There is someone else on the
other side of that mirror,

67
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,073
another me.

68
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,932
How is that possible, Eva?

69
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,293
A fractal variable caused by the mirror.

70
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,513
A duplicate of you.

71
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,265
You mean the mirror
left a fake clone of me

72
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,603
in the real world?

73
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,888
We're getting out of here.

74
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,093
I've tried. For six years,

75
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,596
I've been in my own personal hell.

76
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,857
Eva, I have to go home.

77
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,527
I'm sorry you're stuck here, but...

78
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:10,482
I thought I was gonna die here alone.

79
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,960
At least now there's two of us.

80
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,780
Investigation into the disappearance

81
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,800
of socialite Sue Dearbon.

82
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:22,995
Day 274

83
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,290
since her parents first
hired me to find her.

84
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,794
Status update.

85
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,296
Nothing.

86
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,056
Sue's trail went cold in Midway City

87
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:36,967
after Remington Meister
provided a dead end.

88
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,562
However, she was there.

89
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,847
Meister confirmed that much.

90
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,601
Hey, what are you still
doing here... oh, seriously?

91
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,138
Ralph. When I left last night,

92
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:49,488
you were standing here staring
at the exact same board,

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,870
same as the night before.

94
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,108
Honey, don't you think maybe

95
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,402
it's time you got a little help?

96
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:56,652
- And a shower?
- Cecile, this is my process.

97
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,673
I work things out with the only person

98
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:01,158
that can keep up with my
beautiful detective mind.

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,868
- Me.
- You could work with me.

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,037
We took down the FEMA guy
together, that was so great.

101
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,847
You're not loving that, all right.

102
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,257
- Um...
- Cecile, you know me.

103
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,542
I-I like doing things my own way.

104
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,177
Ralph...

105
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,212
every Holmes needs a Watson.

106
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,316
- Hang on.
- Mm-mm.

107
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:20,942
What is it?

108
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,055
So a couple months ago,
I put up these alerts

109
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,833
on Sue's bank accounts,
trusts, and credit cards.

110
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:29,353
Apparently, she just
made a small deposit on..

111
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:32,064
an apartment in Central City.

112
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,616
See? Told you.

113
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,193
- Only partner I need is...
- This guy.

114
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,695
- Mm-hmm.
- See you.

115
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,901
Oh, wow, something
definitely just died in here.

116
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,210
Kara and Lex Luthor?

117
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,391
Man, this post-Crisis world

118
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:56,972
gets harder to understand every day.

119
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,757
Right?

120
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,529
- Man.
- What's wrong?

121
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,302
I'm still sore

122
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,222
from our little double date
with Amunet and Goldface.

123
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:06,556
So, so weird.

124
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,891
Maybe you should stay home today.

125
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,027
No, no.

126
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,246
Are you working on
more Black Hole stuff?

127
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,040
Yeah, I think I am getting

128
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,109
really close to taking
this son of a bitch down.

129
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,211
Yeah.

130
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,534
That's the mirror gun?

131
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,446
Yeah, it contains bleeding-edge

132
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,907
reflective micro-chip technology.

133
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,575
If I can examine the gun up close,

134
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,503
then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

135
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,788
that connects the gun to Black Hole

136
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,624
since McCulloch created it.

137
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,085
It's still in the Starchives, right?

138
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,012
Yeah, yeah, it is.

139
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:40,270
Could you, um, get it for me?

140
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,774
Uh...

141
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,593
I-I mean, unlocking a weapon like that

142
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,346
sounds like a bad idea.

143
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:48,616
Barry, it's me.

144
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,101
I-I know, but I mean,
after what just happened

145
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,811
with you and Carver...
w-what if the gun

146
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:53,937
fell into the wrong hands?

147
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,364
Just like the cold
gun fell into Snart's.

148
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,291
It won't, trust me.

149
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,609
Iris, I... look, you I trust,

150
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,278
but, um, the guy who just tried to

151
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,155
to have you assassinated,

152
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,361
not so much.

153
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,116
I mean, and if Black Hole had a weapon

154
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,636
as powerful as the mirror gun,

155
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,996
I mean, there's no
telling what could happen.

156
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,054
Yeah, you're right. I will... um,

157
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,332
I'll try a different angle.

158
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,220
I'm just being cautious.

159
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,648
Yeah, I know, I get it.

160
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,507
Have fun.

161
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,801
Okay.

162
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,544
Not exactly the Ritz.

163
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,968
Get down!

164
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,542
What the hell, lady?

165
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,377
Hey, I just saved your life.

166
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,096
You're welcome, by the way.

167
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,694
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,012
It's you.

169
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,031
You're Sue Dearbon.

170
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,558
In the flesh.

171
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,269
And you are?

172
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,248
No one followed us. We're clear.

173
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,828
Sue, I... I have been looking for you

174
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,009
- for nine months.
- Ouch.

175
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,516
I hope you don't bill by the hour.

176
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,624
Where have you been?

177
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,093
A-and why did your
apartment explode in my face?

178
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,521
Yeah, hate it when that happens.

179
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,339
Look, I'm serious.
Now who set that bomb?

180
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,840
Why are they trying to kill you?

181
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:37,884
And how long has this been going on for?

182
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:40,437
Uh, my ex. Because I know too much.

183
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,698
About nine months. You done?

184
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,441
No, I'm most certainly not done.

185
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:47,560
Why is your ex sending
you explosive candy grams?

186
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:50,688
Ooh, the cheap stuff.

187
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:56,235
Look. Drinks later.

188
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,571
Spilling your guts to
tell a tragic story?

189
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,382
- That'd be now.
- Fine.

190
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,784
I fell in love with a murderer.

191
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,053
Happy?

192
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,226
John Loring.

193
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:14,896
Turns out Mr. Dreamy Muscles
and charisma-for-miles

194
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:17,775
was also a major arms
dealer on the black market.

195
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,384
So why does Loring want you dead?

196
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:22,646
Because I stumbled
across his client lists,

197
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:24,430
weapons inventory, and everything else

198
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,933
that exposes him for the
bag of crap that he is.

199
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:29,102
The first time he tried to kill me,

200
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,954
I was asleep.

201
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,605
All right, well...

202
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,090
- Who are you calling, Slick?
- Your parents.

203
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,662
To let 'em know you're safe.

204
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:40,279
Hmm.

205
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:43,500
What... come on, I just switched plans.

206
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,368
John can track your phone.

207
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,620
You call my parents, they're dead.

208
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,348
All right, then, uh,
we'll go to the police.

209
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,249
I know a Precinct
Captain who can help us.

210
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,127
The last time I tried that,
they tried to kill me too.

211
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,586
John's got cops on the payroll

212
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,681
in every city he does business.

213
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:02,519
Then what's your plan
to get out of this?

214
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:06,606
Sue, you can't run forever.

215
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,974
Who says I'm running?

216
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:12,120
You and Loring are hunting each other.

217
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,851
That's why you're in Central City.

218
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,957
John's in town for a massive sale.

219
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,035
If I can get damning
evidence on what he's doing,

220
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:20,796
he goes to jail.

221
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,155
And I go home.

222
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,966
I smell a mystery.

223
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:27,043
I smell...

224
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,470
Expired milk.

225
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:30,046
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

226
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:31,715
Your parents hired me
to do whatever it takes

227
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:32,975
to bring you home safely.

228
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:35,126
And that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,378
- How?
- Easy.

230
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,672
I'm gonna find Loring, I'm
gonna get your evidence,

231
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:41,174
then I'm gonna take it to CCPD.

232
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,476
And after I do that,
I'm gonna take you home.

233
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:47,322
John's a killer. You'd
be risking your life.

234
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,282
For me.

235
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:54,353
If you get killed...

236
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,998
my parents are out good money.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,950
I'm coming with you.

238
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:05,198
1,322. 1,322.

239
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,420
- 1,322. 1,322.
- Okay.

240
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:12,756
Eva, there has got to
be a way out of here

241
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:13,923
that we haven't thought of yet.

242
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,833
There isn't.

243
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:18,377
There's only two options in this place:

244
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,270
survival or madness.

245
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,590
1,322...

246
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:25,360
Eva, my husband will be
looking for me, please.

247
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:29,030
This is how it all starts!
Don't you understand?

248
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:31,524
You sit here and you think
everything's gonna work out.

249
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,777
You can't possibly stay here forever,

250
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:38,422
and then 1,322.

251
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:40,992
That's how many times I've
tried to escape this place.

252
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:44,240
That's how many times I've failed.

253
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:47,031
1,322 reminders

254
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,676
that I'm never leaving this place.

255
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:55,557
So please don't...

256
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,726
give me another one.

257
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,803
I'm having a really bad hair day.

258
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:14,651
I'm sorry. I...

259
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:18,104
I've been alone for a very long time.

260
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,540
Well, you're not anymore.

261
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,025
We just need one way out of here, Eva.

262
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:24,661
That's it.

263
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:31,584
Sam Scudder.

264
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,286
Who?

265
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,172
He was one of the bad
guys. He trapped...

266
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:39,223
someone in a mirror a few years ago.

267
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,818
And my friends got him out by
bringing it to absolute zero.

268
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,170
We...

269
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,506
Eva, we just need to
find some liquid nitrogen.

270
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,411
Well, I-I have a lab down the hall.

271
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,777
There should be some in there.

272
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,304
The nitrogen should slow
down the mirror's molecules

273
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,980
to the lowest enthalpy state possible.

274
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,909
Oh, my God.

275
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:57,953
This could work.

276
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:06,369
Hey, Barr. Morning.

277
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,945
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

278
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,174
Yeah, what's up, Captain?

279
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:10,631
- Eh.
- Yeah, that never gets old.

280
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,709
Yeah, it kinda does. Um, listen.

281
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:16,222
There was a house fire on
Batton Street last month.

282
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,600
- Okay.
- The occupant died

283
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,215
of smoke inhalation.

284
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,885
I'm wondering if you
could take a second look.

285
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,942
Joe, this case was already
declared an accident.

286
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,981
Yeah.

287
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:29,526
I need, uh, fresh pair of eyes on it.

288
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,798
Okay, I mean, what am I looking for?

289
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,347
Whatever you find.

290
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,209
Joe, I mean, I've got
a mountain of cases

291
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,475
I need to go through.

292
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:39,185
Ones that haven't been solved already.

293
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:42,188
Okay, all I can say

294
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,482
is that you'd be doing me a favor.

295
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,242
And whatever you find, Barr,

296
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,953
bring it directly to me.

297
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,072
Okay.

298
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,957
Thank you.

299
00:13:58,498 --> 00:13:59,872
John owns that warehouse.

300
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,163
That's where the deal will go down.

301
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,258
Where are you going?

302
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,504
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

303
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,282
Oh, look, I get it.

304
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:09,715
Chivalry's your brand.

305
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,587
You're an MIT grad, speak six languages,

306
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,606
and you play polo.

307
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,417
You belong in a country
club, not in the field.

308
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,681
You belong in the 19th
Century with your Victorian,

309
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,517
save-the-damsel-in-distress crap.

310
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,611
Loring doesn't know that I'm coming,

311
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,872
so I have the element of surprise.

312
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,278
You, on the other hand,

313
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,708
he might kinda know that you're coming.

314
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,285
Translation: stay in the car, please.

315
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,376
I hope Loring looks good in orange.

316
00:14:56,723 --> 00:15:00,558
Uh, I don't suppose you're
a fellow bird watcher?

317
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,620
Huh.

318
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:17,954
Hey, Vin Diesel!

319
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,316
You still want me to wait in the car?

320
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:37,803
So you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

321
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,811
My parents sent me
to Kyoto for a summer.

322
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,525
Trained with a blind sensei.

323
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,694
- Taught me everything I know.
- Really?

324
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,880
No.

325
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,956
I trained with a guy
named Frank at a YMCA.

326
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,608
Will you relax?

327
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,818
We're safe here. John's not stupid.

328
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,315
Killing me in a public place?

329
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,613
Uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

330
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:57,133
I'm sorry, I believe
he blew up an apartment

331
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,843
- to get to you.
- That building was scheduled

332
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,419
for demolition next month.

333
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:03,313
But he does know that
someone's after him now.

334
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,165
It'll make him harder to get to.

335
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,383
Thanks to you.

336
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:09,781
Where are you going?

337
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:10,950
Sorry, Slick.

338
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,336
I can't partner up with someone

339
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,724
who doesn't think I
can pull my own weight.

340
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:15,675
Hang on a second, Sue. Hang on.

341
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,062
Will you just hang
on one second, please?

342
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,822
Look, when I take a case,

343
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:22,158
I see it through to the end.

344
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,568
And this doesn't end until you're safe.

345
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,245
Do you trust me, Ralph?

346
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,240
I just met you.

347
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,076
But you did save my keister.

348
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,412
Twice. And that means I owe you.

349
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:36,837
And I always pay my debts.

350
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,008
I'll take that as a yes.

351
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,751
So...

352
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:43,253
- without those pictures...
- We are back to square one.

353
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,181
Fortunately, we still
have John's ledger.

354
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,924
He keeps a detailed record of every deal

355
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:48,316
he's ever made in it.

356
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,543
Years of evidence against him.

357
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,049
But his office is still
on the seventh floor

358
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,816
of that warehouse.

359
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,478
Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

360
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,022
But the sewer system,
that's a good way in.

361
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:56,575
Those tunnels, they lead
directly to the center

362
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,157
- of the building.
- And then we time our entry

363
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,236
- for when the guards...
- Change shifts.

364
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,466
And then we mosey up the
stairs into Loring's office,

365
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,515
we get the prize.

366
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:05,183
Well, you are slick.

367
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:09,446
Oh, my God, Ralph, you found her!

368
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:11,373
Oh, technically, I found him.

369
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:15,099
Sue Dearbon.

370
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,236
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:17:16,238 --> 00:17:17,788
Cecile Horton. Meta-human attorney.

372
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,734
But I also have 20 years of experience

373
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:21,908
defending non-meta-humans.

374
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,577
The law is my game, Cecile is my name.

375
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,629
I can cover you no matter
what you've had going on

376
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:26,880
- all this time.
- Just need a quick word.

377
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:31,084
Oh, gotcha. Just one sec.

378
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,970
Listen, we're... we're...

379
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:35,084
we're kind of in the
middle of something.

380
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,081
Uh, Sue's been on the
run for the last year.

381
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,068
It turns out that someone's after her.

382
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,388
And you're her knight in shining armor?

383
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,908
Ralph, I love it!

384
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,244
By the way, you two? Hmm.

385
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:51,104
When I read the both
of you with my powers,

386
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,231
I could barely tell you apart.

387
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,751
Like, emotionally speaking,

388
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:59,936
you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

389
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,322
Just trying to keep her safe.

390
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,407
I mean, it's not like we're dating.

391
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:13,009
I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

392
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:17,273
You would have, eventually.

393
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,852
What's happening?

394
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,581
No.

395
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,157
It should've worked.

396
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,659
No.

397
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:49,503
No.

398
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,614
I really thought I was
going back to my old life.

399
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:08,574
Eva, you will.

400
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:11,660
It doesn't even matter anymore.

401
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,856
My sweet Joseph.

402
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,566
We were so in love.

403
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:24,798
I saw him in the mirror.

404
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,416
I watched him for five years

405
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:31,997
as he mourned, grieved, and...

406
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,791
moved on.

407
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:38,020
And I can't... I...

408
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,439
I can't move on.

409
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,494
- Gah!
- Oh, my gosh. Nash.

410
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:15,248
I didn't think anyone
else would be down here.

411
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,251
I-I lost something down here, so.

412
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,229
Oh, right. Well, that makes sense.

413
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:22,806
These Starchives are so massive.

414
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm sorry, what were
you doing down here?

416
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,647
Cisco asked me to hold down the fort

417
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,098
while he, uh...

418
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,522
He wanted me to take the inventory,

419
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,560
so I gotta do that. It sucks.

420
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:36,770
That's a lie.

421
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,252
Uh, what are you doing here?

422
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:44,962
I lost Nora's journal.

423
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,039
I haven't seen it for a couple weeks.

424
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,799
And, um...

425
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,592
you know, it's the
only thing I have left

426
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:52,410
of my daughter, so.

427
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:56,390
- Ah, must be hard.
- You would know, wouldn't you?

428
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,917
Now that I think about
it, that's probably...

429
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,794
I am digging up the past,

430
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:03,013
and, you know, maybe I should

431
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:06,183
start living in the present.

432
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,684
- So should we all.
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,862
But it's difficult for you.

434
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:12,022
Isn't it, Nash?

435
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:15,075
There's so much unfinished business.

436
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:16,851
- Look, Nash.
- Right.

437
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:19,604
Barry doesn't know about this.

438
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:20,956
He'll be crushed if he knew

439
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,116
that I lost anything of Nora's, so.

440
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:26,820
Could you maybe not mention

441
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:28,488
me being down here?

442
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,866
Maybe you should mention
why you're down here.

443
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:33,284
It'll be our little secret.

444
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:35,637
I always knew I liked you.

445
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,410
Loring's office is
right up those stairs.

446
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,196
Last one there buys the Gingold.

447
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,673
Hey!

448
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,750
Freeze! Stop or we'll shoot!

449
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:23,551
- At least he's not a pack rat.
- Focus.

450
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:24,752
Um...

451
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,146
- Not finding it.
- Search faster.

452
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,937
- Think I've got something.
- That's not a ledger.

453
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,198
No, it's a key for a safety deposit box

454
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,849
at the CC Mercantile Bank.

455
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:41,770
Where I'm guessing your ex hid
the ledger for safe keeping.

456
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:44,625
Good point. Time to go.

457
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,905
Whoa!

458
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,790
Uh, we have a problem.

459
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,718
- Do you trust me?
- Define trust.

460
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,244
Hang on.

461
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,704
Are you crazy?

462
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,056
Sometimes?

463
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:02,632
Don't let go.

464
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:17,430
We just...

465
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,891
You just...

466
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,559
You're the Elongated Man?

467
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,745
Yeah, I'm just full of surprises.

468
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,495
How... how did you become

469
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:34,365
the Elongated Man, anyway?

470
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,700
I was brutally experimented on

471
00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:37,520
by a covert organization for years.

472
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:40,613
They forced me to consume
rubber-based polymer compounds.

473
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:43,282
- Seriously?
- No.

474
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,826
I rode a bus.

475
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:51,072
So you're, like, an
honest-to-God superhero.

476
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:52,524
What's that like?

477
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:54,042
It's like any other job you love.

478
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:57,505
It's rewarding as hell.

479
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,150
But boy, the hours? Let me tell you.

480
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,759
Seriously.

481
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,752
You're like a...

482
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,064
good person.

483
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,240
I helped you get a key.

484
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:08,307
It's no ledger.

485
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,517
Well, Loring's ledger

486
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,402
will definitely be in the box

487
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:12,904
that goes with this.

488
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,522
Now we know where the box is located.

489
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,620
All we have to do is open it.

490
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,294
And then you can get back to your life.

491
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:22,029
Listen...

492
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:24,865
I want you to know how
much I appreciate you

493
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:27,419
trusting me with your secret.

494
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,981
It means a lot.

495
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:35,167
Uh...

496
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,711
I can call my friends at CCPD

497
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:39,022
and get a warrant for
Loring's deposit box.

498
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,172
Shouldn't take more than a day.

499
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,746
We don't have a day.

500
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:42,944
Loring's already spooked.

501
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:44,843
He could move that box at any minute.

502
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:47,030
I feel like our only chance at...

503
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:48,556
- nah, it's too crazy.
- Come on.

504
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,275
Share your thoughts with the class.

505
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:53,578
What if...

506
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:58,616
We break into CC Mercantile Bank now?

507
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:00,026
Just us.

508
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,431
And take the ledger for ourselves.

509
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:02,903
Believe that's called stealing.

510
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:05,215
Oh, come on, Slick.

511
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:07,050
You're also a P.I.

512
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,386
You can't tell me you've
always operated by the book.

513
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:12,681
No, but I can't commit a crime.

514
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:16,917
I get it.

515
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,878
And I respect that.

516
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,778
But Ralph, I'm not a hero.

517
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,674
So if this is the only chance I have

518
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:26,311
to see my parents again,

519
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:28,688
I have to take it.

520
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,723
Sue...

521
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:32,108
being a hero,

522
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,686
it's about helping innocent people.

523
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:38,606
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.

524
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:40,250
- You're not?
- No.

525
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,660
But we do this my way.

526
00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:44,879
We get inside, get the ledger,

527
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:48,240
and immediately bring
it to my friends at CCPD.

528
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,885
Deal or no deal?

529
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:55,181
Deal.

530
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,794
So? What did you find out?

531
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,088
- These scorch marks.
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,356
They're giant burns like

533
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,808
sunlight through a magnifying glass.

534
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,278
So in your expert CSI opinion...

535
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,022
The fire was started by UV light rays.

536
00:26:11,024 --> 00:26:15,026
Same way Dr. Light
torched "The Citizen."

537
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,912
All right, Joe.

538
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,489
What's going on?

539
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,608
Look, this isn't the only file I found

540
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,204
where it looks like something
had fallen through the cracks.

541
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:30,324
All of these cases
involve accidental deaths.

542
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:31,867
All the victims are associated

543
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:34,212
with this guy Joseph Carver.

544
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:37,832
I'm start to think that
somebody here in CCPD

545
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:40,167
is helping him cover this up.

546
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:45,523
You think there's a mole here?

547
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,984
Carver's influence runs deep, man.

548
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,895
Governors, mayor, CEOs.

549
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:53,806
Okay, all right, um,

550
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:56,972
look, this is what Iris
is already investigating.

551
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,562
Her lead had to do with the mirror gun

552
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:01,831
that we stole from McCulloch
Technologies last year.

553
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,261
It fell through because
I wouldn't give it to her.

554
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,708
Why didn't you give it to her?

555
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,569
- I mean, was it dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah.

556
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,775
I mean, it could put her in danger.

557
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:10,368
Yeah, I don't trust
what the world might do

558
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,450
if that gun got out there.

559
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:12,952
Yeah, well, the world is crazy,

560
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:16,327
but it's clear that
Carver is really dangerous.

561
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,848
Iris is your partner and family,

562
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,683
and I don't think we
can trust this right now

563
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:24,336
with anybody other than family.

564
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,888
I'm sorry you're not gonna
see your husband again,

565
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:31,719
but it's easier if you just accept it.

566
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:36,348
Eva, you said that you wanna
go back to your old life.

567
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,452
Look, maybe it's gone, but
you can start a new one.

568
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,164
I'm glad it's broken.

569
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:47,201
I'm glad it's broken.

570
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:53,407
I'm tired of looking at a world
that doesn't want me anyway.

571
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:57,411
I'm tired of waiting for
someone to come and rescue me.

572
00:27:57,413 --> 00:28:00,247
And I'm sick and tired of people

573
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:03,059
telling me that everything
is gonna be all right.

574
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,960
Because it isn't.

575
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,972
It's never gonna be all right!

576
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:10,090
Never!

577
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:22,353
What just happened?

578
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:25,231
I think we just found
our way out of here.

579
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,401
And you're sure this is necessary?

580
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,563
A credible tip came in to CCPD

581
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:34,567
saying this branch was a
target for robbery, so yes.

582
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,576
Well, this is the only
way in or out of the vault.

583
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:38,781
The inner gate is fitted

584
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,746
with an anti-theft electrical system.

585
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:43,649
Opening or closing it
without the manager's key

586
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:46,418
automatically activates
a 50,000 volt fail-safe.

587
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,379
An electric fence to keep the cattle in.

588
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:49,922
- Yeah.
- Smart.

589
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,340
Thanks, pal.

590
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:57,096
Sweet Fancy Moses.

591
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:59,932
Mmm.

592
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:03,694
Huh, I understand why people
are grossed out when I do that.

593
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,121
Your turn, Slick.

594
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:06,814
Oh, right.

595
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,297
You know, besides a
passion for fisticuffs

596
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,323
you've got a real knack
for detective work.

597
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:19,043
You ever think about
getting behind a desk?

598
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:21,996
Ugh, that sounds worse
than my boarding school.

599
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,548
Or the times my parents made me take

600
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,145
horseback riding lessons.

601
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:27,385
Or learning French every Saturday

602
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:30,897
at the US Embassy in Paris.

603
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:37,362
Gee, your childhood sounds just awful.

604
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:40,323
I didn't say it was awful.

605
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:43,367
It just wasn't me.

606
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,823
The truth is,

607
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:48,503
I always hated the
whole socialite scene.

608
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:51,317
Which is why, one day,
I woke up and realized

609
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:54,170
I had no idea who I was.

610
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:57,364
Guess I still haven't figured
out exactly where I belong.

611
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:00,001
Poor little rich girl.

612
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,036
How could she be so lost?

613
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:06,090
No, I... I get it.

614
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,834
I used to wear that
uniform you've got on.

615
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:11,712
I was a cop. A damn good one.

616
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:15,883
And then that ended
abruptly, and I got lost too.

617
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:19,937
And I rode that bus,
and found where I belong.

618
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:22,514
So you're saying there's hope for me?

619
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:25,493
There is from where I'm standing.

620
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,599
So, partner.

621
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:37,279
It's a big moment. You
mind if I do the honors?

622
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:40,082
Of course.

623
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:42,242
You earned it.

624
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:54,564
- Found it.
- Must be a tiny ledger.

625
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,399
Now what do you say we get out
of here and play "Mario Kart"...

626
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:02,822
What the hell?

627
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,072
I guess you're not the only
one that's full of surprises.

628
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:17,079
We are this close to taking down Loring.

629
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,635
Sue, why are you doing this?

630
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:25,754
Who cares about Loring?
I don't even know the guy.

631
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:27,445
I do, however,

632
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,734
know where he keeps his valuables.

633
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:35,889
There never was a ledger.

634
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,391
- Keep going.
- That's why you rented

635
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:39,485
an apartment in Central City.

636
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:42,104
You knew I was keeping tabs on you,

637
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:45,249
so... so you lured me in.

638
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,985
You rigged your own
apartment to explode for...

639
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,903
for what? Just to sell the story of...

640
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:52,331
of sympathetic socialite
running for her life?

641
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,834
You bought it.

642
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:57,077
But don't feel bad.

643
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,596
You're a good guy.

644
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,339
And a hero.

645
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,458
You probably see the best in everyone.

646
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,086
Me, I see what I want

647
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,847
and I take it.

648
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,298
You used my detective mind

649
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,235
to track down Loring's deposit box.

650
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:15,279
You... you played everyone.

651
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:19,784
Your parents are desperate to find you.

652
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:21,310
Do they even know what you really are?

653
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:24,480
No. That's our little secret.

654
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:29,318
If they found out their
only daughter was a thief,

655
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,986
they'd be devastated.

656
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:33,113
So you keep your mouth
shut about who I am,

657
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,633
I keep mine shut about who you are.

658
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:38,994
Deal, Elongated Man?

659
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:43,049
Sue, was anything you told me real?

660
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:45,334
Yes.

661
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:46,668
And no.

662
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,961
See you around, Slick.

663
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:05,521
CCPD.

664
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:06,814
You're all under arrest.

665
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,440
Nice try, officer.

666
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:11,169
But I have a silent
alarm on my deposit box.

667
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:13,529
So I know you stole that from me.

668
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,123
No phone.

669
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,634
Can't stretch through these bars

670
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:21,203
without getting seriously toasty.

671
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:27,468
Always come prepared.

672
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,878
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yeah, I do.

673
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,597
I'm that guy.

674
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,937
You're not getting
rid of me that easily.

675
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:50,941
- Give us a minute.
- Kill 'em both.

676
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:55,910
I'm inside you?

677
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:57,623
Do you have any idea
how disgusting this is?

678
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,075
- I'm saving your life.
- No, you're not.

679
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:01,020
We are not partners.

680
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:02,552
I have handled being shot at before.

681
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:03,939
Why does that not surprise me?

682
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,965
- Let me out.
- Sure, I'll let you out.

683
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,185
And then I'll take you to Iron Heights

684
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:09,162
as soon as these idiots run out of ammo.

685
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,881
Ugh, do you ever shut up? Do something.

686
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,089
I am doing something.

687
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,050
What's your contribution to
this quaint little scenario?

688
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,236
Oh, wait, nothing.

689
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:20,387
This is all your fault.

690
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:25,225
Always come prepared.

691
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,932
_

692
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,506
_

693
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:50,504
Is there anyone that
doesn't want to kill you?

694
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,132
Not really.

695
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,277
_

696
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,310
I have really gotta learn Spanish.

697
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:15,484
You want the diamond?

698
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,544
Come and get it.

699
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,875
_

700
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,463
_

701
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,720
_

702
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:27,474
_

703
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:12,916
Looks like we've both been had.

704
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,548
She softened him up.

705
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,026
Let's finish the job.

706
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,026
It's all yours, Captain West.

707
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:33,729
Thanks, Flash. Clear this out, guys.

708
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,924
- Hey, bud.
- Flash.

709
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,102
- Yeah.
- It's him.

710
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:38,496
He's the one who robbed us.

711
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:39,512
Excuse me?

712
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,267
That's a case of mistaken identity, sir.

713
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,238
I'm sure Captain West can explain.

714
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:47,459
It's all right.

715
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:49,062
Hey man, I'm sorry I got word late,

716
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:51,430
but I searched the whole
area. Ultraviolet's gone.

717
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:54,027
- Couldn't stop her.
- But don't worry, we'll get her.

718
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,363
I promise.

719
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,673
I wasn't talking about Ultraviolet.

720
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,593
Loring's in custody,

721
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:06,896
but facial recognition
isn't picking her up anywhere

722
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:08,782
in Central City.

723
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,526
Looks like Sue Dearbon has vanished.

724
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,045
Again.

725
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:15,197
That's on me.

726
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,257
She played me, Iris.

727
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:19,719
Like... Coltrane's soprano sax.

728
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:21,310
Ralph, you can't beat yourself up.

729
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:23,723
I mean, it's not like you
knew who you were dealing with.

730
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,634
I'm supposed to be a master detective!

731
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:28,636
Ralph, we've all put our trust in people

732
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:31,188
who have betrayed us. God knows I have.

733
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,974
I'm gonna go tear down my crime board.

734
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,741
It's gonna take him a
while to get over this one.

735
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,820
Hey, Joe told me that
you came by CCPD today.

736
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:48,563
I think I know why
you didn't come say hi.

737
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:04,329
What happened to it falling
into the wrong hands?

738
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:07,433
These are the right hands.

739
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:10,377
Joe and I found evidence
linking Carver's assassins

740
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:11,795
to more killings.

741
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:14,756
Crimes that CCPD thought were accidents.

742
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:18,894
Black Hole is a lot more
dangerous than I even realized.

743
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,097
But if you can use this in
your investigation in any way

744
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,141
to bring down Carver
and his people faster,

745
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:28,120
then that's a good thing.

746
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:32,816
And while I don't trust the world...

747
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:35,152
I do trust you.

748
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:37,154
With everything.

749
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:45,162
Thank you.

750
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,891
You have a connection
to the mirror, even

751
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:57,725
when it's broken.

752
00:38:57,727 --> 00:39:00,394
Now who sounds crazy?

753
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:03,155
I've seen a lot of strange
things in the last six years.

754
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:06,233
You being able to control
that mirror is the least of it.

755
00:39:06,235 --> 00:39:08,828
Sam Scudder could even
travel through them.

756
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,330
Well, I'm not a meta-criminal
who jumps through mirrors

757
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:13,031
to rob banks.

758
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,403
I know.

759
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:16,165
You're much more than that.

760
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:18,192
We're the only people
in this world, Eva,

761
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:22,039
so trust me when I say that
you're stronger than you think.

762
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:25,118
You're a survivor.

763
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,662
Now prove it.

764
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,342
You did it. Now keep going.

765
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,190
1,323...

766
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:40,610
I'm still with you.

767
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,750
How did I do that?

768
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:02,850
I don't know.

769
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:05,260
But I promise you,
we will figure it out.

770
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:48,060
Game on.

771
