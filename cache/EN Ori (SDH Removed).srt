00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,442
Jules Verne once wrote,

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,987
<i>"Put two ships in the open sea</i>

3
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,573
<i>without wind or tide,
they will come together. "</i>

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,266
<i>That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other.</i>

5
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,898
<i>We are something else.
Try Arthur Treacher...</i>

6
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,281
It's okay.

7
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,627
Easy. You weren't breathing.

8
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,351
<i>They were
from different worlds.</i>

9
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,315
<i>But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.</i>

10
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,779
I was gonna make you some eggs.

11
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,575
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

12
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,330
It's okay.

13
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,081
I made tea.

14
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,421
Go on, try it.

15
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,756
It'll make you better.

16
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,820
So, who are you?

17
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,534
Atlanna.

18
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,163
Queen of Atlantis.

19
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,832
Wow.

20
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:16,672
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

21
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,163
<i>She had fled
an arranged marriage.</i>

22
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,124
<i>Left her whole world behind.</i>

23
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,545
<i>But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something unexpected.</i>

24
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,302
<i>And my father
found the love of his life.</i>

25
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,683
<i>Category 4 Hurricane Arthur</i>

26
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,311
<i>is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.</i>

27
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,604
How about Arthur?

28
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,815
After the hurricane?

29
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,944
After a legend. He's a king, isn't he?

30
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,448
He's more than that.

31
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,326
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

32
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,746
He could unite our worlds one day.

33
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,758
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

34
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:48,096
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

35
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,768
It made him so powerful
that the ocean itself became jealous

36
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,563
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

37
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,566
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

38
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,112
But, legend has it
that one day a new king will come

39
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,573
who will use the power of the trident

40
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,534
to put Atlantis back together again.

41
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,542
Take him!

42
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,437
Queen Atlanna,

43
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:42,275
by the authority of King Orvax,
you are ordered to return to Atlantis.

44
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,735
Atlanna!

45
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,824
<i>But Atlantis' memory is long...</i>

46
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,370
<i>And its king refused to let her go.</i>

47
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,051
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

48
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,303
- My weapon!
- Here!

49
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,875
<i>Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,</i>

50
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,128
<i>and I was a product of a love
that never should've been.</i>

51
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,088
You don't have to do this, Atlanna.
Please.

52
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,592
No. They will always find me.

53
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,886
Next time, they'll send an army.

54
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,517
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

55
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,522
Save you.

56
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,029
Where I come from...

57
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,575
The sea carries our tears away.

58
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,245
Not here.

59
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,248
Here you feel them.

60
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,511
I will return to you. When it's safe.

61
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,387
One day.

62
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,432
Right here, at sunrise.

63
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,811
We'll be together again.

64
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,233
You stay strong, my little prince.

65
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,735
I'll always be with you.

66
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,330
Don't let him forget me.

67
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:30,068
All life came from the sea,
so if we want to understand ourselves,

68
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,945
we must journey to where we began.

69
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,908
Now, today, we have better maps of Mars
than we do of our own sea floor.

70
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,035
Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.

71
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,079
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

72
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,582
Stop that. Come on.

73
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,834
Come along.

74
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,170
Bye, fishy. Bye.

75
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,674
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

76
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,594
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

77
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,680
Arthur is talking to the fish.

78
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,806
Such a freak, Arthur.

79
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,101
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

80
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,061
Stop it! Don't!

81
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,438
Let me go!

82
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,056
Who are you?

83
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,891
Come on, let's go. Move it.

84
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,977
Come on. Hurry up.

85
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,904
Sir, we've secured the captain.

86
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,239
Distress signal's disabled.

87
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,491
We're running dark again.

88
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,452
But they heard it. You can count on it.

89
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,748
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

90
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,667
And you don't tell me how to pirate.

91
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,221
Where's the rest of the crew?

92
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,265
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

93
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,392
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

94
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,060
Our reputation precedes us.

95
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,604
Your reputation.

96
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,022
This is your win.

97
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,278
Here.

98
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,740
Can't take that piece of junk.

99
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,533
It's the love of your life.

100
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,329
I never told you the story behind it.

101
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,623
This was your grandfather's.

102
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,711
He was one of the Navy's first frogmen
during World War II.

103
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,007
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

104
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,345
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

105
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,682
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

106
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,893
And this knife.

107
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,188
He gave it to me when I was your age.

108
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,818
And now it's yours, son.

109
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,515
Did we just hit something?

110
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,769
No. Something hit us.

111
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,646
Sir, there's something out there.

112
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,814
Another submarine?

113
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,691
No. I think it's a man.

114
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,449
That's not a man.

115
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,915
<i>Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway.</i>

116
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,480
Permission to come aboard?

117
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,238
Aquaman!

118
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,770
I've waited
a long time for this.

119
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,077
Am I supposed to know who you are?

120
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,330
I scavenge the high seas.

121
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,749
You're the Aquaman.

122
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,793
We were bound to meet at some point.

123
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,256
Let's not make it a habit.

124
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,008
Up.

125
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,162
Dad!

126
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,957
Dad?

127
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,544
That's your kid?

128
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,009
Shame on you.

129
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,846
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

130
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,930
Get yourselves out of it.

131
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,015
Bastard!

132
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,775
Dad!

133
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,243
Dad!

134
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,289
Wait!

135
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,124
Help me! He's trapped!

136
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,959
You can't leave him like this!

137
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:14,962
Please!

138
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,383
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

139
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,357
Get outta here! I got this!

140
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,524
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

141
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,904
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

142
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,451
- Now, go!
- No!

143
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,286
- Go!
- Shut up!

144
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,084
No!

145
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,669
No!

146
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,230
Damn you!

147
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,690
Go.

148
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,686
I always know where to find you.

149
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,938
Old habits.

150
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,575
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

151
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,915
You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?

152
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,836
How is it that I can breathe underwater,

153
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,838
but you can still drink me
under the table?

154
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,175
That's my superpower.

155
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,426
A Russian submarine

156
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,387
<i>hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.</i>

157
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,181
<i>The same pirates who are suspected</i>

158
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,934
<i>in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified</i>

159
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,603
<i>prototype stealth submarine.</i>

160
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,940
<i>And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports</i>

161
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,693
<i>that the metahuman dubbed
by social media as "The Aquaman"</i>

162
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,362
<i>was responsible for this daring rescue.</i>

163
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,614
That's not me.

164
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,451
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you?

165
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,329
What Vulko trained you to do.

166
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,083
I knew you couldn't
stand on the sidelines forever.

167
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,502
Your mother
always knew you were special.

168
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,628
Don't even start.

169
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,048
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

170
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,383
Just stop.

171
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,223
Whatever Atlantis' problems are,
you're bigger than them.

172
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,100
Atlantis murdered my mother.

173
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,893
You don't know that for sure.

174
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,019
Yes, I do.

175
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,232
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

176
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,484
And you know it.

177
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,075
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

178
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,083
Hey, buddy.

179
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,879
You that fish boy from the TV?

180
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,339
Oh, great.

181
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,599
It's "fish man. " What do you want?

182
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,934
I'll tell you what I want.

183
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,356
Could we get a picture with you?

184
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,400
You're like our local hero, man.

185
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,863
It would mean a lot. Just a quick...

186
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,660
Whatever.

187
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,621
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

188
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,748
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

189
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,791
There we go. Everybody smile.

190
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,265
He understands the significance
of this meeting.

191
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,392
He'll hear you out.

192
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,080
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

193
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,709
You picked a meeting place
too close to the surface for my liking.

194
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,252
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

195
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,006
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

196
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,009
our ancestors gathered here.

197
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,095
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

198
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,849
Xebel, as always, by his side.

199
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,934
Brine. Fishermen.

200
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,978
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

201
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,355
The Lost Nation had not yet vanished.

202
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,817
Together, they were the greatest empire
the world had ever seen.

203
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,947
But now, I sit on Atlan's throne,
shackled by archaic laws and politics.

204
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,907
While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

205
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,160
Violence has always plagued the surface.

206
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,537
They will destroy themselves.

207
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,081
Not before destroying us first.

208
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,834
We have been hiding long enough.

209
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,005
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

210
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,549
We honor you, King Nereus,

211
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,429
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

212
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,556
to join King Orm's alliance.

213
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,600
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

214
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,560
By law,
you need four of the Seven Kingdoms

215
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,770
to ascend and attack.

216
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,648
The Lost Nation and the Deserters
have long perished.

217
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,524
The Trench are nothing but animals.

218
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,486
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

219
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,449
Without me and my army to convince them,
your plans are stillborn.

220
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,910
But I know what you really want.

221
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,496
Once you've obtained
the pledge of the four kingdoms,

222
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,206
you will be ordained

223
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,708
Ocean Master.

224
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,544
That is merely a title.

225
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,172
I'm no fool, King Orm.

226
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,757
As Ocean Master, you'll be commander

227
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,134
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

228
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,387
I am the natural choice to lead it.

229
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,723
Are you?

230
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,394
What about the rumors
that there's another?

231
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,271
An Atlantean, living among the surface.

232
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,774
One of royal blood.

233
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,362
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

234
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,531
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

235
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,659
My mother's bastard
has never even been to Atlantis.

236
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,993
His loyalty is to the surface.

237
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,090
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

238
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,279
Your king is injured!

239
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,924
I'm not trying to start a war.

240
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,218
The war has already begun.

241
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,013
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

242
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,852
- I'm good.
- Stop.

243
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,771
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

244
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,606
Let's go home
and work on your tā moko.

245
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,483
If your grandpops was still alive,

246
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,610
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

247
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,240
Yes, he would,
but there is plenty of time for that.

248
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,951
We gotta get you to bed.

249
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,496
Got it?

250
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,462
I've been looking for you.

251
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,922
Oh, no, no, no...

252
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,715
I need you to come with me to Atlantis.

253
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,509
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

254
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,094
that I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

255
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,555
Except nicer, because you're a lady.

256
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,557
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

257
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,725
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

258
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,311
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

259
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,148
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

260
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,025
Billions will die.

261
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,443
Your people and mine.

262
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,071
We must stop him.

263
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,744
And how do you propose we do that?

264
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,081
You are
the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.

265
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,292
The throne is yours by birthright.

266
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:23,463
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

267
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,134
is for you
to take your rightful place as king.

268
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,723
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

269
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,268
I'm the bastard son of the queen
your people executed.

270
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,354
Trust me. I am no king.

271
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I agree.

272
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,941
That's awesome. Cool.

273
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,652
But, Vulko seems to
believe in you for some reason,

274
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,945
and that's why I'm here.

275
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,781
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

276
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,409
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

277
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,535
It's not a myth.

278
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,204
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

279
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,333
You can then claim your birthright
and dethrone Orm.

280
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,252
My birthright? It died with my mother.

281
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,672
But I promise you this. If Orm attacks,

282
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,759
I will treat him exactly the same way
your people treated her.

283
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,470
With no mercy.

284
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,657
<i>That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose.</i>

285
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,827
One of your kind intervened.

286
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,454
<i>He is not one of us.</i>

287
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,207
He killed my father.

288
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,502
<i>Our transaction has ended.</i>

289
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,634
Keep the money. I want Aquaman.

290
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,831
Dad!

291
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,171
Dad!

292
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,741
Dad!

293
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,497
Pops!

294
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,166
Pops!

295
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,588
Come on, Pops.

296
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,134
Come on! He's not breathing.

297
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,385
Move! Let me help.

298
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,269
Come on, Pops.

299
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,948
Come on.

300
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,173
I don't even know your name.

301
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,384
It's Princess Y'Mera Xebella Challa.

302
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,387
You may call me Mera.

303
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,765
Thank you, Mera.

304
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,288
Dear God.

305
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,707
This was Orm's doing.

306
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,336
The worst is yet to come.

307
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,970
<i>There's a flash flood warning here</i>

308
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,723
<i>that was just extended
for a couple hours.</i>

309
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,392
<i>Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.</i>

310
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:13,230
<i>We are seeing warships
and trash washed up by massive waves.</i>

311
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,399
<i>These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste</i>

312
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,027
<i>and garbage are taking place
all over the world.</i>

313
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,155
<i>Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land.</i>

314
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
<i>Many are asking the question,</i>

315
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,909
<i>"Was this a natural disaster
or something else?"</i>

316
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,869
<i>No. This was no natural disaster.</i>

317
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,288
<i>They threw out our garbage
and our warships.</i>

318
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,791
<i>This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.</i>

319
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,919
<i>There you go again
with your insane Atlantean theory.</i>

320
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,796
<i>You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.</i>

321
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

322
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,799
<i>We already have
an Atlantean living among us,</i>

323
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,342
<i>and his name is Aquaman.</i>

324
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,059
What is it?

325
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,063
This is the exact spot that
Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.

326
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,526
You have to forget
all the teaching of the surface world

327
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,905
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

328
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,949
But I already know how to swim.

329
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,118
Not even close.

330
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,206
Just so we're clear,

331
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,542
I'll help you stop this war.

332
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,836
But then, I'm done.

333
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,588
Maybe that's for the best.

334
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,236
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

335
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,738
It is who we are.

336
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,906
Wait, you can talk underwater?

337
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,035
I can talk underwater, too!

338
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,870
This is awesome!

339
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,415
Oh, we can do more than just talk.

340
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:06,968
<i>Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.</i>

341
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,681
<i>Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,</i>

342
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,267
<i>and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.</i>

343
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,459
This is awesome!

344
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,698
So, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

345
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,412
Soon, my young prince.

346
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,541
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

347
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,719
I hid my ship in here.

348
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,973
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

349
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,933
Well, to get where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

350
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,602
Your fish ship
has been marinating in chum butter.

351
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,354
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

352
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,148
That'd be an improvement.

353
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,613
Yup. Okay.

354
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,801
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

355
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,054
The Gateway Bridge is a remnant
of the Old World.

356
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,056
It's also the only way in or out
of the Capital.

357
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,474
Why can't they just go over the walls?

358
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,309
Security is impenetrable.

359
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,936
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

360
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,729
they'd never get past the hydro-cannons.

361
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,775
People try to sneak in all the time.

362
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,694
Yeah, right.

363
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,049
What is this?

364
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,884
Customs and border control.

365
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,555
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

366
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,397
Welcome home.

367
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,406
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

368
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,367
The Highborns
never venture to the sea floor.

369
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,619
We're here.

370
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,232
What is this?

371
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,069
We use this air pocket
as an extra layer of precaution.

372
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,446
Only the Highborns can breathe water
as well as air.

373
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,198
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

374
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,034
They get kind of messy.

375
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,830
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

376
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,708
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

377
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,131
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

378
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,342
I can't believe Orm attacked.

379
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,468
It wasn't an attack.

380
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,929
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

381
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,224
What he did to your surface warships
was merely a warning.

382
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,392
What provoked it?

383
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,479
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

384
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,981
By the surface? I don't think so.

385
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,858
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

386
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,527
I was there.

387
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,570
A surface warship fired at us.

388
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,490
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

389
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:07,328
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

390
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,582
If we're going to prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

391
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,669
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

392
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,421
You don't understand.

393
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,590
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

394
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,719
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

395
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,763
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

396
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,098
Okay? I don't even know where to begin.

397
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,851
By winning
the hearts and minds of the people

398
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,397
by proving to them that you're worthy,
and retrieving this.

399
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,780
I already got one of those.

400
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,284
Not like this one, you don't.

401
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,369
This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.

402
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,121
Oh, I know the story.

403
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,957
It's more than a story. It's real.

404
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,628
<i>It was forged by
the greatest weapon masters in history.</i>

405
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,425
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

406
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,386
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

407
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,725
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

408
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,186
So what happened to it?

409
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:17,106
To know that is to go back to the time
before the Great Fall,

410
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,818
<i>when King Atlan ruled over all that was,</i>

411
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,489
<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.</i>

412
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:32,371
<i>It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.</i>

413
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,042
<i>We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy</i>

414
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,545
<i>at a time when the rest of the world
still thought the earth was flat.</i>

415
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,259
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

416
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,512
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

417
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,615
<i>The ocean swallowed us,
and Atlantis sank.</i>

418
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,119
<i>But the very power
that collapsed our civilization</i>

419
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,831
<i>also paved the way to our future.</i>

420
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,501
<i>It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.</i>

421
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,462
<i>And so, we evolved.</i>

422
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,716
<i>Others regressed, became savage.</i>

423
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:32,014
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

424
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,561
<i>Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.</i>

425
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,982
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

426
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,111
It's an ancient recording
dating back to the First Dynasty.

427
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,073
I believe it contains
Atlan's final message to his people

428
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,742
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

429
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,452
So, what does it say?

430
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,414
We don't know. The technology's too old.

431
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,584
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

432
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,795
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

433
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,716
The clue to Atlan's final resting place
is inside of this.

434
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,069
Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry.

435
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,237
No!

436
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,782
You mustn't be seen here!

437
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,715
I don't suppose
you want to talk about this, do you?

438
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,138
Neither do I.

439
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,808
In the name of His Highness, King Orm,
I place you under arrest.

440
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,080
Welcome to Atlantis...

441
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,332
Brother.

442
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,339
I can't believe you're finally here.

443
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,635
I've heard so many stories about you.

444
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,686
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

445
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,606
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

446
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,985
Ashamed of the fact that I have
a half-breed brother

447
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,821
whose heart
I wanted to run my trident through.

448
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:21,035
But now that you're finally here
before me, I must admit...

449
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,419
I am conflicted.

450
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,466
You want conflict, why don't you take
these chains off, little brother?

451
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,301
And we'll see who gets run through.

452
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,641
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

453
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,479
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

454
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,939
To kill me?

455
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,733
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

456
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:53,984
I see.

457
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,737
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

458
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,406
that the surface continues to commit?

459
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,246
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

460
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,665
and poisoned our children.

461
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,294
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

462
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,092
And you've come all this way
to take sides against your own people?

463
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,927
There are no sides in a war like this.

464
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,972
You have clearly chosen a side
and come here to challenge the throne.

465
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,932
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

466
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,937
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

467
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,315
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

468
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,777
Well then,
perhaps that's how we'll proceed.

469
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,529
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

470
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,613
Don't you see?

471
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,991
If I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna

472
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,618
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

473
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:49,707
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

474
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,169
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

475
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,129
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

476
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,091
Your Highness, he doesn't know our ways.

477
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,218
Then he's about to get an education.

478
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,680
Are you officially challenging me?

479
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,640
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

480
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,559
If you win,

481
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,146
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

482
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,481
But if I win...

483
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,401
You're over.

484
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,361
Let's do it.

485
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,863
So be it.

486
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,491
Challenge has been made, and I accept.

487
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,410
Prepare him for the Ring of Fire.

488
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,206
Wait. The ring of what?

489
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,311
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

490
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,939
It seems to me
like I just solved all of our problems.

491
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,358
I beat him in a battle, war's over,
I get to go home.

492
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,610
You're a formidable fighter on land,

493
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,946
but here
you're out of your element, literally.

494
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,782
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

495
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,326
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

496
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,496
You taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.

497
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,665
Let's see if you remember anything.

498
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,920
So, what's with the big fork?

499
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,506
It's a trident. Now, defend yourself.

500
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,332
What the hell is this?

501
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,960
I'll teach you this move
when you've mastered the trident.

502
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,305
It's not fair.

503
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,849
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

504
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,728
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

505
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,147
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

506
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,774
Why has she never come to see me?

507
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,943
I told you, when you're ready...

508
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:27,114
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

509
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,950
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

510
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,327
When am I gonna be good enough?

511
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,499
Does she not love me?

512
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,586
Your mother loved you
more than anything in the world.

513
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,257
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

514
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,469
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

515
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,304
so she had to marry him...

516
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,890
And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

517
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,101
When Orvax
eventually found out about you,

518
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,812
he became overwhelmed with jealousy

519
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:03,275
and sacrificed her
to the creatures of the Trench.

520
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,447
Are you saying they executed her?

521
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,075
Because she had me?

522
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,132
I remember...

523
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,093
Everything.

524
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,556
I have something for you.

525
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,434
It belonged to my mother.

526
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,396
Tell me...

527
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,442
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

528
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:51,407
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

529
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,868
I truly do. I don't want war...

530
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,120
Don't patronize me!

531
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,538
I know you.

532
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,498
What you're doing
flies in the face of everything

533
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,291
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

534
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,418
If she were here...

535
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,630
But she's not here, is she?

536
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,133
What my mother taught us was treason.

537
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,136
Don't follow in her wake.

538
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,097
All right! So, this is
the big, old ring of fire?

539
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,684
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

540
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,772
Vulko.

541
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,651
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

542
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,539
Let's go, Lady Mera.

543
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,799
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

544
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:55,679
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

545
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,766
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

546
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,354
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

547
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,566
Atlantis has been lying in wait...

548
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,110
And now, the beast has awakened.

549
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:22,039
There was a time when
I wanted to meet you more than anything.

550
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,625
Get to know my little brother.

551
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,922
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

552
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,385
If only I had known
what a dick you would turn out to be.

553
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,350
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

554
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,728
And I've hated you for it ever since.

555
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,067
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

556
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,987
I'm going to give you one chance.

557
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,365
Go home.

558
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,910
Do not ever come back to Atlantis.

559
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,997
You are not going to win this.

560
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,377
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

561
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,797
And I am bringing
the wrath of the seven seas with me.

562
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,175
You know I can't let that happen.

563
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,970
I know.

564
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,391
What the hell is that?

565
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,894
The Ring of Fire.

566
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,071
Yeah!

567
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,659
Yeah!

568
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,834
Shit.

569
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,087
People of Atlantis, hear me!

570
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,592
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

571
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,555
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

572
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:06,143
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

573
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,945
Traitor!

574
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,947
Traitor!

575
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,580
You'll never be king!

576
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,804
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

577
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,556
would bow before the king of Atlantis.

578
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,560
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

579
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,228
Beg them for mercy?

580
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,689
I detest the surface as much as you do.

581
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,734
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

582
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,075
But you wouldn't be that gullible,
would you?

583
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,704
You want this war too, don't you?

584
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,457
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

585
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,001
If this is how it must be done,
then so be it.

586
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,301
You have our mother's trident.

587
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,554
Powerful, but flawed like her.

588
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,890
I wield my father's.

589
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,018
And it has never known defeat!

590
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,986
I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.

591
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,747
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

592
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,450
I am the one true king!

593
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,038
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

594
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,175
Mera!

595
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,180
Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?

596
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,350
The plan was to recover Atlan's trident,
then challenge Orm.

597
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,768
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

598
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:40,894
Shit happens.

599
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,401
Heads up! We got a bogey on our six!

600
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,737
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

601
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,948
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

602
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,184
Wait, you said
we couldn't go over these walls.

603
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,936
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

604
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,146
I did, now shut up!

605
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,569
Oh, shit!

606
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,218
Shit!

607
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,054
Shit.

608
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,682
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

609
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,643
Oh!

610
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,194
Here, hold this.

611
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,363
What are you doing?

612
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,532
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

613
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,160
Never mind. Come here, get in. Come on.

614
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,331
Great. So we're getting eaten.

615
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,646
How are you even doing this, anyway?

616
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,523
I don't know.

617
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,526
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

618
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,612
Right. Because you're both big,
dumb animals.

619
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,697
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

620
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,329
She said, "Coast is clear. "

621
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,456
So, where to now?

622
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,336
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

623
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,922
All right.

624
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,156
I don't usually take charters,

625
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,199
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

626
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,826
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

627
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,204
Oh, man.

628
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,456
Are you okay?

629
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,750
I've never been so high up before.

630
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,421
Or so far from home.

631
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,257
But at least you have a home.

632
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,301
Not anymore.

633
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,136
I can never go back.

634
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,264
I betrayed everything
when I saved you from the coliseum.

635
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,563
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

636
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,691
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

637
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,651
But forgiving, it is not.

638
01:09:58,819 --> 01:09:59,861
Yeah, but you're royalty.

639
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,112
So was your mother.

640
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,158
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

641
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,827
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

642
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,000
Look on the bright side,

643
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,586
now you don't have to marry some
tool bag that you're not in love with.

644
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,088
My obligation isn't to love.

645
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,841
It is to my family and my nation,

646
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,302
and I've turned my back on both.

647
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,682
Sometimes, you have to do what's right,

648
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:33,311
even if your heart aches against it.

649
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,954
Your Highness.

650
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:56,709
The tracker places Princess Mera here,
in the Deserter Kingdom.

651
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,795
You said she was dead.

652
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,880
Apparently not.

653
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,008
Then your brother
still lives as well?

654
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,176
Not for long.

655
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,679
Captain Murk,
assemble a strike force immediately.

656
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:12,100
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

657
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,309
She betrayed the throne.

658
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,811
She is a daughter of Xebel.

659
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,815
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

660
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,066
Your Highness,

661
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,695
we are now entering
the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.

662
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:27,865
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

663
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,867
should be our immediate concern.

664
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:37,667
My vizier is correct. As usual.

665
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:45,383
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

666
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,866
We're here!

667
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:12,618
Hey!

668
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,245
Is there anything nearby?

669
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,830
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

670
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,166
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

671
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,377
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

672
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,799
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

673
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,260
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

674
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,319
Shit!

675
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,583
Oh, you're crazier than I thought!

676
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:01,793
A- ha!

677
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,504
This way.

678
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,320
<i>You were defeated the last time
because your surface weapons failed you.</i>

679
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,447
<i>Ours will not.</i>

680
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,244
<i>It's prototype armor</i>

681
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,663
<i>for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.</i>

682
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:42,250
<i>Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.</i>

683
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:45,461
<i>You will lead my finest commandos
as your personal army</i>

684
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,172
<i>to hunt down the half-breed abomination.</i>

685
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:52,552
<i>I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world.</i>

686
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,888
<i>Kill him and the woman he's with,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

687
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:58,141
Killing him is my reward.

688
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,938
<i>The crown jewel.
Still experimental.</i>

689
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,484
<i>Converts water
into beams of energized plasma.</i>

690
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,393
I think I'm gonna need a bigger helmet.

691
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,438
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here

692
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,607
when this region
was still an inland sea.

693
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,401
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

694
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,111
Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.

695
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,279
We're getting close now.

696
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,740
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

697
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,200
Close to getting punched in the face!

698
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,702
Look, Fight Club, I know you're new
to how things work up here.

699
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,829
Why don't you look around? We are lost.

700
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,498
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

701
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:47,583
Nada. This place is a wasteland.

702
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,670
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

703
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,338
This isn't my home!

704
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,257
It's not like the whole surface
looks like this!

705
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,591
Oh, no, of course not.

706
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:59,470
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

707
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:01,347
and whole mountains made out of trash.

708
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:02,640
And, oh, you've got great factories

709
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,850
that do nothing
but belch out filth and melt ice caps.

710
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,936
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

711
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,062
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

712
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,689
but we've got
some good things too, all right?

713
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,733
We got green forests and big mountains
and beautiful lakes.

714
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,069
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

715
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,904
Are you trying to provoke me?

716
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,073
I'm just saying you cannot judge a place
before you've even seen it.

717
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,742
You've judged Atlantis on far less.

718
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:28,958
No. Would you
just stop it with that? No.

719
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,545
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you
to jump out of an airplane

720
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,255
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

721
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,303
If you're the next true king,
we're doomed.

722
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,874
That was awesome.

723
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,882
Oh. Look what I found.

724
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,134
What you found?

725
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,260
Yeah.

726
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,397
Check this place out.

727
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,524
This is badass!

728
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:38,986
This is the Hall of Armory.

729
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,907
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

730
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,535
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

731
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,126
Vulko was right.

732
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,089
It's real.

733
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,546
Nothing.

734
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,423
Of course it's not working.

735
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,634
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

736
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,263
Man!

737
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,725
"Since before the Sahara was a desert. "

738
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,685
Thank you
for repeating what I just said.

739
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,687
It's completely dried out.

740
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,232
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

741
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,067
when you're not thinking at all.

742
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,318
All right, now hold still.

743
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,612
Hey. What are you doing?

744
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,657
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

745
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,201
Now, hold still.

746
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,572
Show-off.

747
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:48,949
I could have just peed on it.

748
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,711
King Atlan.

749
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:07,843
<i>In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis.</i>

750
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:11,889
<i>In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction.</i>

751
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,225
<i>But in the hands of the true heir,</i>

752
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,311
<i>it would unite all our kingdoms
above and below.</i>

753
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:23,275
<i>If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.</i>

754
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:26,487
<i>Journey beyond the edge of the world
to the Hidden Sea.</i>

755
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,657
<i>Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.</i>

756
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:35,579
<i>Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see.</i>

757
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,055
We can't let Orm find this.

758
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,725
Hey! Wait!

759
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:58,936
What?

760
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,230
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

761
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,232
I memorized it. Didn't you?

762
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,443
Oh, yeah. Totally.

763
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:09,280
What'd he just say?

764
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,325
"Something something trident. "

765
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,634
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path. "

766
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,601
It's our next stop.

767
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,572
I'm starting to think you
actually like these surface-dwellers.

768
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,117
It would be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before.

769
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,871
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

770
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:45,436
Well, apparently, it's just right up
on the hill. A big old castle.

771
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:49,231
And I just learned something
very interesting.

772
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:50,524
<i>Pinocchio.</i>

773
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:54,028
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

774
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:58,282
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

775
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,533
Oh!

776
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,368
I got it from the movie.

777
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:10,210
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

778
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,504
beyond that ancient notion

779
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,757
that war with the surface is inevitable.

780
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,801
It is the position of the Fishermen

781
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,888
that when the time comes
to make ourselves known to the landsmen,

782
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:24,600
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

783
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,687
I admire your lofty aspirations,
King Ricou.

784
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:37,488
But I suspect they are but clouds of ink
hiding the heart of a coward.

785
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,239
How dare you!

786
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,827
Please. I implore you.

787
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:48,123
You're a kingdom of bloated philosophers
and flaccid poets

788
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,460
whose waters have grown stagnant,
and it sickens me.

789
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,470
My King!

790
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,265
The king is dead! Long live his heir.

791
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,227
Princess.

792
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,439
Prepare your armies, Your Highness.

793
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,401
We move against the Brine Kingdom
at once.

794
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,994
What did the recording
say, again?

795
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:29,164
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea.

796
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,291
Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

797
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:35,295
Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see. "

798
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:40,134
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path. "

799
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,723
Oh, man.

800
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,433
What?

801
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,686
Wow.
That's awesome.

802
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,062
Let me see.

803
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,649
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

804
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:57,067
Here, let me see.

805
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:58,652
What was the last line?

806
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:02,239
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see. "

807
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,074
"Only in the hands of the true... "

808
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,202
Marcus Agrippa.

809
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,538
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

810
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:13,000
Neither was Scipio.

811
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:15,669
How do you know all this stuff?

812
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,172
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

813
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:23,802
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

814
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,263
First king of Rome.

815
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,560
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see. "

816
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,655
There it is. That's our heading.

817
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:45,490
What? Let me see.

818
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:48,869
We did it!

819
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,204
Oh!

820
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,916
That's not bad for an imbecile?

821
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:57,544
Not bad at all.

822
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:12,643
Mera.

823
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:20,609
"Loathsomeness waits
and dreams in the deep,

824
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:25,572
and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men. "

825
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:30,494
Get back!

826
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,251
Arthur!

827
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:41,380
I order you to stand down!

828
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,007
Princess Mera, you've been charged
with high treason.

829
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,696
Who the hell are you?

830
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,823
Maybe this will jog your memory.

831
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,247
You're the guy from the sub.

832
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,249
That's right.

833
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,170
But now I have Atlantean steel.

834
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:11,678
Call me "Black Manta. "

835
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,029
You thought you could walk away?

836
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,745
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

837
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:58,642
You can't run.

838
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,853
You owe me blood!

839
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:03,188
How'd you find me?

840
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:07,651
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

841
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:25,562
No!

842
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:01,056
Come on.

843
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,562
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

844
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:16,780
I'll show you
the same mercy you showed my father.

845
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:19,491
And gut you like the fish you are!

846
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,149
Arthur!

847
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,113
Mera, they're tracking you.

848
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,490
What?

849
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,325
They're tracking you.

850
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,297
Arthur, stay with me.

851
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,967
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

852
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:36,271
Did you steal a boat?

853
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:39,441
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

854
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:42,318
No, those belong to people.

855
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,032
Those were Orm's elite commandos.

856
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,452
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

857
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,912
I've never seen him before.

858
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:55,165
Yeah, I have.

859
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:57,751
He and his father were pirates.

860
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,463
And he blames me for his father's death.

861
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:06,259
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

862
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:08,970
That's not how it feels.

863
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,933
It was up to me, and I let him die.

864
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:16,895
I could've saved him, but I didn't.

865
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:21,900
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

866
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:23,443
And that would have been my fault.

867
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,447
Well, he's behind us now.

868
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:31,242
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

869
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:36,164
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

870
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,251
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

871
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,170
Yes.

872
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,506
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

873
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,549
It's become a place of death.

874
01:36:46,842 --> 01:36:48,843
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

875
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:54,390
We should turn back.

876
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,936
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

877
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,062
Turn back?

878
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,774
Look, I learned from a young age
not to show weakness.

879
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:07,070
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

880
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:09,113
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

881
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:13,618
But I've done nothing
but get my ass kicked this whole trip.

882
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,372
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

883
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,124
I do not work or play well with others.

884
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:24,587
And I can't let you die trying
to turn me into something that I'm not.

885
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,509
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

886
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,721
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

887
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,307
You are the bridge between land and sea.

888
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,060
I can see that now.

889
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:41,729
The only question is...

890
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,608
Can you?

891
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:04,711
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

892
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:07,088
Vulko.

893
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:09,591
My trusted vizier

894
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,469
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

895
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,474
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

896
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:21,728
I have already given it, My King.

897
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,981
But I will stand by your decision,
as always.

898
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:27,191
My decision.

899
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:30,653
To protect it.

900
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,365
While you betray it.

901
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:39,287
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

902
01:38:39,496 --> 01:38:44,042
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

903
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:49,923
That you have spent years training him
to take the throne from me.

904
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:54,510
Do not deny it.

905
01:38:57,681 --> 01:38:58,848
I do not.

906
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,683
Why?

907
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,270
I am the pureblood.

908
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:07,482
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

909
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:11,486
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

910
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:12,570
I do serve it.

911
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:15,281
Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,

912
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:19,327
but he's already twice the king
you'll ever be.

913
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,043
Take him.

914
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:30,254
But make sure he has a view.

915
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:13,107
What the hell are these things?

916
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,984
The Trench! We're here!

917
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,322
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

918
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:30,958
They're from the depths.

919
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,585
They're scared of the light. Here!

920
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:46,265
Come on!

921
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:52,355
You ready to jump?

922
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:03,009
Over there!

923
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:39,128
That thing will tear us apart.

924
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,339
We don't have a choice!

925
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,110
Arthur!

926
01:44:06,448 --> 01:44:07,448
Mera!

927
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:39,814
Mera!

928
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:41,983
Mera!

929
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:04,797
Mera!

930
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:08,801
Mera!

931
01:45:53,096 --> 01:45:54,305
Arthur.

932
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,432
Mom?

933
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:39,600
King Orvax sacrificed me
to the Trench, but I survived.

934
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:42,978
I fought my way through as you did,
and I ended up here.

935
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,772
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

936
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,107
Yes.

937
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,650
Come. Sit here.

938
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,116
You must forgive me.

939
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:57,243
Forgive me for everything.

940
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,079
This happened because you had me.

941
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:05,084
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

942
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:08,170
I made a choice. I had to leave...

943
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:12,299
To save you, to save your father.

944
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:17,263
Tell me. Tell me about him.

945
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,056
Is he...

946
01:47:23,019 --> 01:47:25,354
He still walks to the end of that dock.

947
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,190
Every morning.

948
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:32,570
Every day.

949
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:37,324
Waiting for you.

950
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,500
Why didn't you ever come back?

951
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:55,468
Because the portal that brought you here
won't let us return.

952
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,430
The trident is the only way back.

953
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:03,809
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

954
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:08,606
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

955
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:11,692
It lies beyond the waterfall.

956
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:18,115
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

957
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,492
No.

958
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,285
It's too powerful.

959
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:24,038
I've tried many times over the years.

960
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:28,751
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

961
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,422
You're afraid.

962
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:37,218
Yes.

963
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:39,970
Good.

964
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,890
You're ready.

965
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:46,060
Atlantis has always had a king.

966
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:49,563
Now, it needs something more.

967
01:48:50,273 --> 01:48:52,191
But what could be greater than a king?

968
01:48:52,817 --> 01:48:53,901
A hero.

969
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:58,113
A king fights only for his nation.

970
01:49:00,075 --> 01:49:02,159
You fight for everyone.

971
01:50:30,832 --> 01:50:35,210
You do not belong here.

972
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:43,093
I have guarded the trident
against false kings since the beginning.

973
01:50:43,261 --> 01:50:45,554
And for a thousand years

974
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:51,268
I have seen the greatest champions
try and fail.

975
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:57,775
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

976
01:50:58,193 --> 01:51:05,032
You dare come here
with your tainted mongrel blood

977
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:08,577
to claim Atlantis' greatest treasure?

978
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:12,081
So be it...

979
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:15,292
Half-breed.

980
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:38,065
You thought yourself worthy?

981
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:41,235
You thought yourself a king?

982
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:45,197
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

983
01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:46,699
Stop!

984
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:57,668
You're right. I am a half-breed mongrel.

985
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:01,672
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

986
01:52:01,923 --> 01:52:03,215
I know I'm not.

987
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,720
You understand me?

988
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:09,304
I do.

989
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:16,353
No mortal has conversed with me
since King Atlan.

990
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,733
Who are you?

991
01:52:21,484 --> 01:52:22,818
I'm nobody.

992
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:27,906
I came because I had no choice.

993
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:33,996
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

994
01:52:36,374 --> 01:52:40,043
I came
because the trident is their only hope.

995
01:52:40,503 --> 01:52:42,504
And if that's not good enough...

996
01:52:45,049 --> 01:52:46,508
Then screw you.

997
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:55,476
No man has ever freed the trident
from Atlan's grip.

998
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:59,438
Should he deem you unworthy...

999
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:04,902
Well, I haven't feasted in eons,

1000
01:53:04,986 --> 01:53:07,988
and I am famished.

1001
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:41,039
The one true king.

1002
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,972
Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,

1003
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:01,143
but a swift assault aimed directly
at their leadership will turn the tide.

1004
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:02,853
Defeat the Brine King,

1005
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:06,690
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1006
01:55:08,776 --> 01:55:10,527
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1007
01:55:12,363 --> 01:55:13,864
Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!

1008
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:18,493
Rise, Atlantis!

1009
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:39,723
Death to the Atlantean hagfish!

1010
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:47,314
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1011
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:51,652
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1012
01:56:58,177 --> 01:57:00,929
No! We need him!

1013
01:57:03,182 --> 01:57:04,516
Join me or die.

1014
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:08,145
You expect me
to address you as Your Highness?

1015
01:57:08,396 --> 01:57:09,688
Not Your Highness.

1016
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:13,150
Call me...

1017
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,610
Ocean Master.

1018
01:57:15,903 --> 01:57:19,614
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1019
01:57:19,782 --> 01:57:22,951
But you will never have my allegiance!

1020
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:24,327
So be it!

1021
01:57:56,402 --> 01:57:57,569
What the...

1022
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,606
The king has risen.

1023
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:44,324
Attack!

1024
02:00:43,486 --> 02:00:45,904
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1025
02:00:46,113 --> 02:00:49,282
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

1026
02:00:50,701 --> 02:00:52,202
And what if I can't?

1027
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:54,537
Last time, he was in his element.

1028
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:58,458
This time, make him fight in yours.

1029
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,615
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

1030
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:34,411
Yeah, good plan. Don't get killed.

1031
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:09,529
The Trench! He commands the Trench!

1032
02:02:09,613 --> 02:02:10,989
Impossible!

1033
02:02:28,049 --> 02:02:29,382
Stand down! Let her pass.

1034
02:02:29,717 --> 02:02:32,677
Please, Father, he has the trident.

1035
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,138
I know you think this war is necessary,

1036
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:37,724
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

1037
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,267
And if you turn your back on that now,

1038
02:02:39,477 --> 02:02:41,770
then the Atlantis you're fighting for
is already dead.

1039
02:02:42,104 --> 02:02:43,104
It's true!

1040
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:44,856
The half-breed wields
King Atlan's trident.

1041
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:46,024
He commands the sea!

1042
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,195
Then that half-breed is your king.

1043
02:04:07,606 --> 02:04:09,816
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!

1044
02:04:09,984 --> 02:04:11,609
We can't! Look.

1045
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:13,403
The people must bear witness.

1046
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:21,911
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

1047
02:04:23,038 --> 02:04:24,456
A half-breed bastard.

1048
02:04:27,209 --> 02:04:30,378
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

1049
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:34,466
Well, then by bloodshed...

1050
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,553
Do the gods make known their will.

1051
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:10,460
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1052
02:06:46,223 --> 02:06:47,265
Finish it.

1053
02:06:47,474 --> 02:06:48,641
Yield the throne.

1054
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:50,643
Mercy is not our way.

1055
02:06:52,396 --> 02:06:54,314
Maybe you haven't noticed, brother...

1056
02:06:59,903 --> 02:07:01,404
But I'm not one of you.

1057
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:02,780
Do it!

1058
02:07:05,326 --> 02:07:06,909
- Kill me!
- No!

1059
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:11,497
That is enough killing.

1060
02:07:19,089 --> 02:07:20,298
Mother?

1061
02:07:20,966 --> 02:07:22,550
Oh, my son.

1062
02:07:31,727 --> 02:07:33,269
It's a long story.

1063
02:07:33,896 --> 02:07:35,313
I'll tell ya later.

1064
02:07:36,273 --> 02:07:37,607
Come on!

1065
02:07:44,281 --> 02:07:47,033
I don't understand. We thought...

1066
02:07:47,242 --> 02:07:48,242
I know.

1067
02:07:48,952 --> 02:07:50,703
Arthur saved me.

1068
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:56,668
- You're with him?
- I am.

1069
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:03,675
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1070
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:06,552
But you have been misguided.

1071
02:08:08,263 --> 02:08:11,974
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1072
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:13,476
He was wrong.

1073
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,604
The land and the sea

1074
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:19,399
are one.

1075
02:08:39,378 --> 02:08:40,545
My queen.

1076
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:44,882
Vulko.

1077
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:48,469
Take him.

1078
02:08:49,263 --> 02:08:51,431
But make sure he has a view.

1079
02:08:58,439 --> 02:08:59,439
When you're ready,

1080
02:09:01,942 --> 02:09:03,192
let's talk.

1081
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:22,003
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1082
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:24,172
but let it end in joy.

1083
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:29,177
I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.

1084
02:09:29,553 --> 02:09:31,262
Hail to the king!

1085
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:33,973
- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!

1086
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:44,692
So, what do I do now?

1087
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:46,944
Be their king.

1088
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:49,363
Ooh.

1089
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:51,783
This is gonna be fun.

1090
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:46,379
You came back. You're back.

1091
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,798
Yes. Yes.

1092
02:10:54,888 --> 02:10:57,515
<i>My father
was a lighthouse keeper.</i>

1093
02:10:58,517 --> 02:11:00,351
<i>My mother was a queen.</i>

1094
02:11:02,229 --> 02:11:03,688
<i>They were never meant to meet...</i>

1095
02:11:07,317 --> 02:11:09,569
<i>But their love saved the world.</i>

1096
02:11:11,822 --> 02:11:13,739
<i>They made me what I am.</i>

1097
02:11:14,575 --> 02:11:17,952
<i>A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.</i>

1098
02:11:19,913 --> 02:11:21,706
<i>I am the protector of the deep.</i>

1099
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:24,542
<i>I am...</i>

1100
02:11:26,378 --> 02:11:28,087
<i>Aquaman.</i>

1101
02:14:37,277 --> 02:14:38,277
Hey!

1102
02:14:42,532 --> 02:14:43,783
I spent 15 years

1103
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:46,494
<i>at the United States Institute
of Marine Science...</i>

1104
02:14:46,661 --> 02:14:49,705
<i>- Weren't you fired?
- ... studying oceanic phenomenon,</i>

1105
02:14:49,873 --> 02:14:52,166
<i>and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.</i>

1106
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:55,628
<i>Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor.</i>

1107
02:14:55,796 --> 02:14:57,296
We have satellite imagery

1108
02:14:57,464 --> 02:15:00,091
<i>of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface...</i>

1109
02:15:00,258 --> 02:15:01,842
<i>- Dr. Shin!
- Will you please let me finish?</i>

1110
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,761
<i>Here we go again. Atlantean?</i>

1111
02:15:04,304 --> 02:15:06,806
<i>Yes. The government
does not want us to know</i>

1112
02:15:07,015 --> 02:15:08,307
<i>about the threat
that exists right here...</i>

1113
02:15:08,475 --> 02:15:10,267
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1114
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:24,824
This is Atlantean technology, isn't it?

1115
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:26,867
Can you tell me how you got this?

1116
02:15:27,035 --> 02:15:29,745
Sure. But first,

1117
02:15:30,497 --> 02:15:33,207
you gotta tell me how to find him.

1118
02:23:13,126 --> 02:23:14,126
English - SDH
