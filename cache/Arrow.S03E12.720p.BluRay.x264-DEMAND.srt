1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,528
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,882
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,008
...I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,680
To save my city.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,928
Now others have joined my crusade.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,043
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,170
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,325
I am something else.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,246
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,360
Don't waste your breath.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,087
Your concern should be for your home
and what's become of it in your absence.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,171
Together, we are gonna
take over the Glades.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,250
The city servicemen,
especially the police, evacuate.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,283
We won't abandon an entire district.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,491
If I even see a hint of a blue,
your city yes-men, they will be buried.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,889
- The mayor will cede control of the Glades.
- It's up to us to stop Brick.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,890
It's not just Oliver's mission anymore.
It is ours.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,167
Are you trying to kill yourself?

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,763
- I have to get back.
- You have to rest.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,241
I suppose you planned to leave
without telling me.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,047
Well, I knew that you wouldn't approve.
You saved my life.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,201
- Thank you.
- Maseo saved it.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,641
I merely treated you.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,447
And you're going to undo all that work
if you try to leave now.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,048
I can't stay here any longer.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,971
My sister, my city...

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,725
Will mourn your passing, I'm sure.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,490
If you are so concerned...

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,527
...just come with me.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,241
You can make sure
that I drink my penicillin tea.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,368
Like Maseo...

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,411
...I've disappeared from the world.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,250
I have no desire to return.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,722
Tatsu...

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,168
Be well, Oliver.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,724
The Glades have been without
a police presence for a week now.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,724
Daniel Brickwell threatened every member
of local government.

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,803
What else was Mayor Castle
supposed to do?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,241
This is worse
than negotiating with terrorists...

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,770
Tax time.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,284
Brick wants his cut.
Now give me all the cash in the register.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,047
Or I'll make your head look like that TV.

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,924
I have another idea.

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,124
Looks like we got ourselves
a real-life superhero here.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,482
You that red streak
I been hearing about on TV?

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,091
Wrong city.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,410
Either way,
I bet Brick will pay us a finder's fee.

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,371
- Make the call.
- Guns down.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,330
Grant must be some teacher.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,324
Diner at 10th, clear.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,251
- Diner's taken care of.
- He needs help.

52
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,930
Why are these people calling 911?

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,686
Don't they know the police have pulled out
of the Glades?

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,963
Because they're desperate. They're scared.

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,766
Multiple reports of looting
at Western and Oxnard.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,486
Got it. On our way.

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
Sara?

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,485
Someone's dying
here. What are we supposed to do?

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,244
You can '1' just ignore us.

60
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,241
- It's Lance.
- Good. Maybe the cavalry's coming.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,527
Captain Lance.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,166
- You've been busy.
- Trying to keep things together.

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,641
- Doesn't feel like it's working.
- How can I help?

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,561
Can you? The mayor was pretty specific
about blues staying out of the Glades.

65
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,650
Doesn't mean I can't help out
the Hood Squad off the books.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,811
We call ourselves Team Arrow.
Well, actually, that's just me, but...

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,361
I got everything we have on Brick
from Evidence.

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,887
I'll send Arsenal over
once the next fire's put out.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,686
Arsenal? Are you guys just pulling names
out of a hat now?

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,048
Might wanna wrap it up.
Two more calls came in.

71
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,366
Talk soon, captain.

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,927
Then there was a
red-hooded guy and a blond woman in black.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,131
- Change in pattern.
- Disrupt and revise, just like you said.

74
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,765
Heh.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,370
Hesitation is death.

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,770
I didn't hesitate. I just...

77
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,566
- Just didn't kill you.
- And when the fight is real?

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,770
- I'm not a killer.
- Then you're gonna die.

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,691
The League of Assassins
are called that for a reason.

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,531
Mercy is not part of their code.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,927
I didn't sign up for any of this.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,487
The Assassins' League and no mercy.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,843
All I asked for you to do
was to teach me how to defend myself...

84
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,849
...to never let someone hurt me again.

85
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,811
And now you face people
who wanna kill you.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,129
To prevent that, you must kill them first.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,129
It may not be what you signed up for...

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,881
...but make no mistake,
it's what you face right now.

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,001
Thea, I know it's difficult.

90
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,647
I wasn't always a killer.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,089
The first time?

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,251
I have never been more frightened
or remorseful.

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,050
Then why did you do it?

94
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,165
Because the man I killed murdered my wife.

95
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,971
Hey, that's fine.

96
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,364
Put the prospectus on my desk.
We'll get into it tomorrow.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,246
I need to get at least three hours' sleep,
so good night.

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,329
No, no, don't! No, don't!

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,131
Ha, ha. Tommy.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,970
Don't!

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,641
Hey. Tommy, buddy.

102
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh. Come here.
You're just having a nightmare. Oh.

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,928
- Dad?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,043
I'm here now.

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,250
Don't worry. I won't let
anything bad ever happen to you.

106
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,529
- Promise?
- Promise.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,121
I will always be here for you.

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,882
Hey. What...?

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,327
What...? Wow.

110
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
Where's your mom?

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,121
- I don't know. Ingrid put me to sleep.
- Hmm.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,527
Is that Mommy?

113
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,442
Probably. So you'd better go to sleep.
Otherwise, you're gonna get me in trouble.

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,643
Captain Lance.

115
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,607
- Harper.
- I'm not sure what...

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,167
I've seen you wearing a red hoodie,
shooting arrows.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,045
Think I don't recognize you
with extra leather and lace?

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,846
- I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
- No.

119
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,169
- You'll be needing this. Here you go.
- What's this?

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Everything on Brickwell
we could salvage from storage.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,731
Maybe something there will help you
figure out where he is.

122
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,289
- Thanks. We'll get Felicity right on this.
- Any word on our green-hooded friend?

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,726
Still unavailable.

124
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,880
And Sara?

125
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,210
I mean, I hear the Canary come up
every so often on the 911 calls.

126
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,563
I'll let her know you're looking for her.

127
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,289
No.

128
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,371
You just watch her back, okay?

129
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,169
Always.

130
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,487
If I don't suture this,
it's gonna scar, Laurel.

131
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,445
I'll just add it to my
ever-growing collection.

132
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,120
My father give us anything to use
to locate Brick?

133
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,529
I don't see how.
Some of this stuff goes back decades.

134
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,731
There's plenty of evidence against Brick
but nothing the police can make stick.

135
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,526
So this is what Brick has reduced us to.

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,769
Grasping for straws.

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,087
I don't know how you guys
have done this for so long.

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,481
We had Oliver.

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,731
- What are you doing?
- Grasping at straws, I'm pretty sure.

140
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,970
Maybe there's something in Brick's MO that'd
suggest a couple doors for us to kick down.

141
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,531
I mean...

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,006
...for you to kick down.

143
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,407
What was that?

144
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,088
Cross-reference with Alderman Ford's murder
in the evidence your father gave us.

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,411
The same gun was used
in a 21-year-old shooting.

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,170
The same gun?

147
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,761
Either that's arrogance or stupidity.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,801
In this case, definitely stupidity.

149
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,451
The victim from 21 years ago.

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,005
Rebecca Merlyn.

151
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,011
Daniel Brickwell killed
Malcolm Merlyn's wife.

152
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,647
If you wanna tell me, "I told you so,"
how about you say it in person?

153
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,324
Just couldn't stay away from me, could you?

154
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,568
- What changed your mind?
- I've been to enough funerals.

155
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,287
- So help me.
- That isn't what I have been doing?

156
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,688
The man who Maseo serves...

157
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,568
...when he finds out that I'm alive,
he is gonna come for me and my sister.

158
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,926
- Ra's al Ghul.
- Yes.

159
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,527
Maseo spoke of him
while you were recuperating.

160
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,569
He fights with swords.

161
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,888
And he's good.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,884
I seem to remember you being pretty good
with a blade yourself.

163
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,604
Mastery of swords
is more than mastery of technique.

164
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,446
To defeat this man, you
must think like him...

165
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,445
...be like him.

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,808
You must fight in the ways he does.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,526
Your only hope for such a teacher
was Maseo.

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,121
Only the student has hope
of defeating the master.

169
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,928
Sorry I'm late.

170
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,647
What's going on?

171
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,090
- Is it the League?
- No.

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,567
This is personal.

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,406
Personal how?

174
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,729
I told you I killed the person
who killed my Rebecca.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,844
I recently learned I didn't.

176
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,762
I killed the wrong man.

177
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,769
The guilty party is still alive.

178
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,930
Everything I thought I believed in
for the last 21 years is false.

179
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,640
My wife's death remains unavenged.

180
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,161
So let's go to the police.

181
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,170
Or Laurel Lance, okay?
She's a friend and she'll listen.

182
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,930
I swore that I would always protect her
from harm. But I couldn't.

183
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,287
For years,
I believed that justice had been done.

184
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,844
The Undertaking was for her. I truly
believed I could change the Glades...

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,686
...and prevent what happened to my family
from happening to anyone else.

186
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,209
It's all been a lie.
But now I have the chance to set it right.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,482
- I don't understand.
- I know.

188
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,001
Because you're not a killer.

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,204
But I am.

190
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,323
Your dad told me
that your mom's an angel now.

191
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,921
I don't want her to be an angel, Ollie.

192
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,691
I want her to go back to being my mom.

193
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,563
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

194
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,486
I have a friend in the police department...

195
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,571
...he says that they have a person
of interest in Rebecca's...

196
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,161
In the case.

197
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,886
They don't have enough evidence yet
to convict him...

198
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,243
...but if it were me, I'd wanna know.

199
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,769
Brick killed Malcolm's wife.
What does that have to do with anything?

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,083
It is just another reason
for them to share bunk beds in hell.

201
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,250
Not that I believe in hell,
but for them I'll make an exception.

202
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,886
Maybe we should get Merlyn
to solve our Brick problem.

203
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,771
- That's pretty dark.
- If you don't think things are dark...

204
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,689
...you haven't been paying attention.

205
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,249
Even if we did sic Merlyn on Brick, he'd have
as much trouble finding Brick as we've had.

206
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,284
Brick's men have been busy.
They're cutting down cell towers...

207
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,451
...and disconnecting traffic cams
and staying out of satellite line of sight.

208
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,887
Basically, every way I know
how to find somebody.

209
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,607
Well, if the cell towers were down,
how was Brick's crew communicating?

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,925
- At the diner. His men, they were...
- They were using walkies.

211
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,648
Do you think that you could, I don't know,
use those signals to locate Brick?

212
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,009
You haven't been down here much.
If they're communicating via radio...

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,807
...they'll be on the FRS somewhere
between 462 and 467 megahertz.

214
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,449
If I send out a frequency burst, I should
be able to triangulate their location.

215
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,407
I did not understand one word you just said,
but Oliver was certainly lucky to have you.

216
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,250
114 Grandview Plaza.

217
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,130
- Felicity, that's the Glades precinct.
- Well, it's not like police are using it.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,166
Great. We can add irony
to the list of charges against Brick.

219
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,289
Let's gear up.

220
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,011
Let's go.

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,603
Come on, let's go. Move it.

222
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,763
So why don't you explain it to me, boys?

223
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,203
We cleared the register
from that diner on 10th.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,444
No, the part where you had the red one
in front of your shotgun...

225
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,840
...and somehow he's not dead.

226
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,364
You know the deal, boys.

227
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,642
You take me down first, you walk out alive.

228
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,011
Okay, I've cut the power.

229
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,891
There's a ventilation shaft
4O feet north of your position.

230
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,724
They should drop you off in the east wing.

231
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,451
- There are only two sentries there.
- Got it.

232
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,689
If you see anyone, kill them.

233
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,247
You wanna get me?

234
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,045
Roy? Are you there?

235
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,446
Laurel, can you hear me?

236
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,920
This is what we do
when we get you in our sights.

237
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,568
Daniel Brickwell.

238
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,524
What the hell are you supposed to be?

239
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,245
We need to talk.

240
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,488
Somebody please tell me
how this is happening again.

241
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,722
Daniel Brickwell.

242
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,725
It seems we have a common interest.

243
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,208
- You know that Brickwell killed your wife.
- Her name was Rebecca.

244
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,246
Since my death, maintaining my usual
network of associates has become...

245
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,402
...heh, shall we say, problematic.

246
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,001
But the fact you were able
to locate Mr. Brickwell...

247
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,646
...despite the fact
that he has gone to ground...

248
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,763
...demonstrates your group's capacity.

249
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,644
You followed us.

250
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,765
- We led you right to him.
- And I saved your lives in the bargain.

251
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,730
So...

252
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,605
...why not continue our association?

253
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,521
You want us to team up with you?

254
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,283
I guess the question before you is...

255
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,206
...whether your scorn for me outweighs
your need to see Mr. Brickwell dealt with.

256
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,521
You mean killed.

257
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,366
You have your options.

258
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,050
Weigh them.

259
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,481
- Dude, this is awesome.
- Shots on me, bro.

260
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,563
- Here they go. Here they go.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,004
Cheers.

262
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,888
You stole my idea. I was gonna lean here
and wish my problems away.

263
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,724
That obvious, huh?

264
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,048
- So, what are your problems?
- They're not problems exactly.

265
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,560
More like weighing options.

266
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,165
What about you?
Brick's tax collectors giving you trouble?

267
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,082
No, it's Malcolm, but it's probably the
last thing you wanna think about right now.

268
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,688
- You'd be surprised.
- He found out who murdered his wife.

269
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,929
He's fixated on finding the guy
and killing him.

270
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,404
Don't take this the wrong way, but isn't killing
people exactly what Malcolm Merlyn does?

271
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,688
Yes, but he also protects people.

272
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,885
During the siege, he was the only one
who made me a top priority.

273
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,570
He saved my life.

274
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,767
I didn't know.

275
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,209
Despite everything Malcolm was or is...

276
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,206
...it means something that he was there
when I needed him the most.

277
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,689
Even after everything he's done,
he cares about people.

278
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,123
Even all the terrifying things he's done...

279
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,608
...it was because he thought
that he was helping the Glades.

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,131
So, what's on your mind?
Anything I can help you with?

281
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,965
Believe it or not, you already have.

282
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,201
How can you even be arguing for this
right now?

283
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,641
Because I am actually paying attention.

284
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,962
Brick has the Glades under siege.

285
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,841
He has the police running scared.
He has us outnumbered and outgunned.

286
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,647
And I'm not saying
let's give Malcolm a glass case of his own.

287
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,041
All I am saying is...

288
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,568
...let's use him the same way
that he wants to use us.

289
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,328
To point him like a loaded gun at Brick.

290
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,645
- Exactly.
- Well, A, I'm not okay with that.

291
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,242
And B, even if I was, there has to be
a better way to go about doing it...

292
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,125
- ...than to get in bed with Malcolm Merlyn.
- There isn't.

293
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,161
Oliver is gone. And there's only so much
the four of us can do.

294
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,247
I just found this out, but the night
of the siege, Malcolm saved Thea's life.

295
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,844
He didn't have an ulterior motive.
He didn't have an agenda.

296
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,011
He just wanted to protect
what he cared about.

297
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,641
He cares about this city.

298
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,969
He just went about it
in a completely unimaginable way.

299
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,647
So just like Thea did the night
of the siege, we need him.

300
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,844
I can't think of a world or a universe
or a plane of existence...

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,850
...where Oliver would agree to any of this.

302
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,169
Oliver isn't here anymore.
We need to stop pretending like he is.

303
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,285
We need to make decisions of our own.

304
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,689
I genuinely have no idea
how else we're supposed to stop Brick.

305
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,441
I genuinely don't know how we live with
ourselves if we go about doing it this way.

306
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,524
So how does this work? Do we vote?

307
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,845
Has the jury reached a verdict?

308
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,088
It has.

309
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,528
- Guilty.
- I guess that means no, then.

310
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,529
You were expecting something different?

311
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,247
What, that you'd have some measure
of common sense? Yes.

312
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,647
You really thought we'd thrown in with you.

313
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,324
After what you did to Thea,
to Sara, to Oliver.

314
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,490
- To save your precious city, yes.
- Well, that's the thing.

315
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,890
Once we let the ends justify the means...

316
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,764
...that's just the first step.

317
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,769
Towards what?

318
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,242
Becoming you.

319
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,605
Excuse me. Excuse me.

320
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,645
Um...

321
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,451
I think I'm lost.

322
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,521
I suggest you run real fast...

323
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,766
...before I swipe that nice watch of yours.

324
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,371
Do you enjoy robbing people?

325
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,805
I mean, it can't be for the money.

326
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,611
You can't steal enough wallets and watches
to live on.

327
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,531
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?
- Wait.

328
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,130
I just wanna understand. I wanna know
what drives a man to do what you do.

329
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,926
To ruin other men's lives.

330
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,121
You want my watch?

331
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,962
Here. Take it.

332
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,926
Because you've already taken
everything from me.

333
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,366
You're not gonna shoot me.

334
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,644
I bet you never even held a gun before.

335
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,442
Go back to your rich neighborhood.

336
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,805
- Is it safe?
- It's safer than a boat.

337
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,562
Your medicine. Apply twice a day.

338
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,211
Okay.

339
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,563
Tatsu.

340
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,161
Would you come with me?

341
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,204
So I can watch you die
at the hands of Maseo's master?

342
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,044
I do not intend to die.

343
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,051
There are many forms of death.

344
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,851
To defeat a man like this Ra's al Ghul...

345
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,203
...you must be willing not just to die...

346
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,802
...but to live knowing what you had
to sacrifice in order to beat him.

347
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,729
And What Will that be?

348
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,686
I don't know.

349
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,725
That is what you will have to discover.

350
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,207
But it will be
whatever you hold most precious.

351
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,884
Going out?

352
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,841
- How did you get in here?
- I had a good teacher.

353
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,611
If you've come to tell me
what a horrible person I am...

354
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,287
...I'm afraid you'll have to wait
in a very long line.

355
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,323
Actually, I'm here to do the opposite.

356
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,203
I told Roy about that night
at the train station.

357
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,129
How you saved my life.

358
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,731
You're my daughter.

359
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,964
You protected me. Risked your life for me.

360
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,124
Just like my mother did.

361
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,608
Thea, I know you wanna believe
there's more to me than a killer...

362
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,804
...but the fact is, there's not.

363
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,801
That man died with his wife.

364
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,531
- What happened to your face?
- Is it all there?

365
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,288
Yeah, 50,000 in hundreds.

366
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,640
You went after Kendrick Weller.

367
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,166
Hey, hey, whoa.

368
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,006
What did you do?

369
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,848
You killed him. And now you're running?

370
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
We can... We can cover this up.

371
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,848
I can't stay here.

372
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,362
I can't pretend to be
something that I'm not.

373
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,249
- Your son needs you.
- Not like this.

374
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,002
Killing him did nothing.
It didn't bring her back.

375
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,841
It didn't cleanse this anger.

376
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,367
I've heard about a place where anger can be
forged into something else.

377
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,369
Daddy?

378
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,207
Tommy. He)!-

379
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,884
- What are you doing up? Go back to sleep.
- I miss Mommy.

380
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,209
- Tommy, I have to go away for a little while.
- You can't leave.

381
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,890
You said you'd always be there.

382
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,327
I know. But you have to be strong now.

383
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,369
I'm going somewhere where I can learn...

384
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,326
...how to make sure
that no one will ever hurt us again.

385
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,883
Come here.

386
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,087
How'd Merlyn take it?

387
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,089
I think he just felt inconvenienced.

388
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,203
We made the right choice, right?
By refusing Merlyn's help?

389
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,081
I don't know if we made the right choice,
but we definitely did the right thing.

390
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,322
How many people are gonna die
because of it?

391
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,729
- We made a decision, Roy.
- I know. And I know that I was outvoted.

392
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,042
That doesn't change the fact
that we're outmanned.

393
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,561
What if it doesn't? Roy's right.

394
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,560
We need the support out there. But Merlyn,
he's not the only person in town.

395
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,923
- Who else is there?
- The town.

396
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
Hi.

397
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,050
- You've been busy.
- Look, Ted, I was...

398
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,289
I said you weren't ready.
Guess you weren't listening.

399
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,240
Or you gonna tell me that masked blond
that I've seen on the news isn't you?

400
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,649
It's complicated. I couldn't wait.

401
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,922
I didn't come here to argue with you.

402
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,485
What did you come here for?

403
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,129
That a Monte Cristo?

404
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,601
Those will kill you quicker
than this neighborhood.

405
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,290
Abercrombie.

406
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,648
Where the hell have you been? I saw Sara last
night. Why didn't you tell me she was back?

407
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,970
We need to talk about that, after.

408
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,009
After what?

409
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,489
Feels like recess
and we're about to fight the school bully.

410
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,122
- Looks quiet.
- For now.

411
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,769
You ready?

412
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,609
- It's okay to say you're scared.
- Okay, I'm scared.

413
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,810
Is what we're doing crazy?

414
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
It's better to ask that
when not wearing a mask.

415
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,804
There's never been an armed occupation
in history that wasn't overthrown by force.

416
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,681
An all-out assault on Brick,
that's the only way to end this.

417
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,842
Then let's end this.

418
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,850
One way...

419
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,008
...or the other.

420
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,165
Let's go.

421
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,046
My two favorite trick-or-treaters.

422
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,847
Well, look at that. Didn't anybody tell you
Halloween was three months ago?

423
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,846
- Daniel Brickwell.
- You have failed this city.

424
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,241
You seemed to have failed in your maths.

425
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,211
Can't you see there's a lot more of us
than there is of you?

426
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,970
Guess again, Brickhead.

427
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,247
Is this little parade supposed
to mean something?

428
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,204
I'll tell you what it means.

429
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,563
It means the population of the Glades
is gonna plummet severely.

430
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,090
Get them.

431
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
And which costume are you supposed to be?

432
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,243
Wildcat.

433
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,211
Is that all you got?

434
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,281
I've learned you can survive a bullet,
but not when it's put through your head.

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,962
You're gonna be fine.

436
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,325
Really?

437
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,529
How many more of you masks are there?

438
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,802
It's okay.

439
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,891
It's a good thing you fight
better than you lie.

440
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,042
Oliver?

441
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,047
- This is for Rebecca.
- What?

442
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,884
You don't even know her name, do you?

443
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,329
Is this the weapon you used
to murder my wife?

444
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,171
Everybody I dropped was with that piece.

445
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,081
She was a good person. Decent. Kind.

446
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,291
- She ran the clinic right here in the Glades.
- Brunette.

447
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,644
Heh-heh-heh. Yeah, now I remember.

448
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,882
She was my first.

449
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,011
My initiation into the Orchid Bay Butchers.
Heh-heh-heh.

450
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,209
You murdered her
because you wanted into a gang?

451
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,164
No, no.

452
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,244
Because she was weak.

453
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,722
Because she was crying,
begging me not to kill her.

454
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,686
But you won't get that from me.
So come on. Finish it.

455
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,963
Don't do it.

456
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,884
- You are too late.
- Drop the gun.

457
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,366
No more death.

458
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,325
That's easy for you to say.
You just returned from the grave.

459
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,046
Killing him won't balance the scales.

460
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,449
When you have killed 503 people,
including your own son...

461
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,768
...you tend not to worry about scales.

462
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,606
And don't tell me it won't stop the pain
and it won't bring her back...

463
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,762
...because you don't understand.

464
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,364
If I had taken care of him back then...

465
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,609
...it could all be different.

466
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,764
The League, the Undertaking...

467
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,922
...Tommy.

468
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,000
Every choice I have made
since my wife died.

469
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,641
Then you make a different choice now.

470
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,282
For Thea.

471
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,370
Thea will never forgive me.

472
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,961
Start giving her reasons to.

473
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,881
Listen to me. I'm telling you, my guys say
he's out of commission. We can go back in.

474
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,888
I gotta call you back.

475
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,401
There's something I gotta go see.

476
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,404
I've been gone, and I'm sorry.

477
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,491
Sorry for what the city has had to endure
in my absence.

478
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,842
But you did endure it.

479
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,443
And the evidence of that struggle
is lying at my feet.

480
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,844
You did not fail this city.

481
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,847
And I promise
I will not fail you by leaving it again.

482
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,891
I want every block turned upside down,
inside out...

483
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,928
...till each of Brick's dirtbags are lying
on comfy cots in Iron Heights, all right?

484
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,970
Hey. Thanks, captain.

485
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,328
- You should see a doctor.
- No health insurance.

486
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,286
But thanks for bringing the cops back.
Words I never thought I'd say.

487
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,484
- Cindy, right?
- Yeah. I'm friends with your daughter Sara.

488
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,445
I thought you looked familiar.
Haven't seen you in a while.

489
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,486
- I haven't seen Sara in a while.
- Then you missed major ass kicking tonight.

490
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,447
That woman running around
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

491
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,246
Heh. Sure it was. Who else would it be?

492
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,091
I don't know. That's why
I'm talking to you.

493
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,840
- What do you mean? I've spoken to her.
- You should know that wasn't your daughter.

494
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,006
You Okay?

495
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,331
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just wanted to see you.

496
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,204
I was worried.

497
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,362
- But are you okay?
- I am, in fact.

498
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,481
- I didn't do it.
- For me?

499
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,849
For me.

500
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,365
But because of you.
ls my room still available?

501
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,324
Where have you been?

502
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,928
- I've been so worried about you.
- I was in Blildhaven.

503
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,850
Ran into an old friend of mine.
Things got, ahem...

504
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,721
...interesting, and I actually spent
the past few weeks in jail.

505
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,443
- I thought you grew out of that.
- So did I.

506
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,161
- Ollie...
- it's okay.

507
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,404
- Good to see you again, Oliver.
- Yeah.

508
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,810
I think I'm hallucinating.
But thank you for being cool with this.

509
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,089
I'm gonna make some tea
and try to keep things Zen.

510
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,250
Thank you for not making this
difficult for her.

511
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,847
I wasn't always like this, you know.

512
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,410
Before Rebecca died, I was a good father.

513
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,681
I remember.

514
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,522
Killing changes you. It takes away a piece of
your soul and you can never get it back again.

515
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,042
Oliver, I know I wasn't there for Tommy...

516
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,488
...but I see Thea as my chance
for redemption.

517
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,364
You turned my sister into a killer...

518
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,043
...and then you put her in the cross hairs of
one of the most dangerous men on the planet.

519
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,811
You won't believe me,
but I did so with a heavy heart...

520
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,890
...and expecting a different outcome.

521
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,171
Ra's is going to come for me.

522
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,410
And he will learn the truth
about Sara eventually.

523
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,564
And then he will come for Thea and me.

524
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,650
- That's why I have to kill him.
- You couldn't before.

525
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,571
This time, I will have you to train me.

526
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,529
Only the student has hope
of defeating the master.

527
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,089
- I am Nyssa, heir to the demon.
- I'm not here to fight you.

528
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,447
There's no other reason to be here.

529
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,729
Why shouldn't I kill you?

530
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,169
- What does that mean?
- "The magician."

531
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,360
Sorry that I didn't come by sooner.

532
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,044
I just wanted to check in on Thea.

533
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,840
It's okay.

534
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,447
I'm okay.

535
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,123
- Merlyn told us you were killed.
- I was close.

536
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,209
I'm sorry that I didn't reach out sooner.
I wasn't exactly in a cell-service area.

537
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,083
You kept the city together.

538
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,964
Saved the Glades. Well done.

539
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,083
It's a gift from Malcolm Merlyn.
He went looking for you.

540
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,001
- It's Ra's al Ghul's, right?
- Yep.

541
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,567
So, what are we gonna do about him?

542
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,482
- I mean, if he finds out about Thea...
- Merlyn and I are working on that.

543
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,920
Sorry.

544
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,161
For a second there,
it sounded like you said Merlyn.

545
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,250
I need to know how to defeat Ra's.

546
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,929
- Merlyn has the knowledge.
- Merlyn is a monster.

547
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,045
You're in this situation,
Thea is in this situation, because of him.

548
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,447
- Felicity...
- No. Just a few hours ago...

549
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,962
...I stood right here,
and I swore that there was no way...

550
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,289
...that you would ever agree
to work with Malcolm Merlyn. Not ever.

551
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,043
I guess I was wrong about everything.

552
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,690
I need some air. I'm glad you're not dead.

553
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,445
Felicity.

554
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,447
"I need some air" really means
I don't want to talk right now.

555
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,282
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

556
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,407
Maybe you could be a little more specific.

557
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,887
For letting us believe you were dead...

558
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,923
...for weeks?

559
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,800
Or for abandoning every principle
you claim to have...

560
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,962
...by getting into bed with Malcolm Merlyn?

561
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,688
- I...
- Mm-mm.

562
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,689
- That's not why you're upset.
- While you were gone...

563
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,123
...for almost a month...

564
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,086
...I allowed myself to fantasize...

565
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,410
...to dream that maybe, just maybe...

566
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,967
...Merlyn was wrong.

567
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,890
That you were alive
and that you would come back.

568
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,367
And that when you did,
you would be different.

569
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,208
That almost dying would give you
a new perspective on life.

570
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,691
- That you would just do things differently.
- Things between us, you mean.

571
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,688
Before you left,
the last thing you said to me...

572
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,484
...was that you loved me.

573
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,168
Now you're back, and the first thing you tell
me is that you are working with the man...

574
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,170
...who turned your sister,
a woman you're supposed to love...

575
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,206
...into a killer
who killed a woman you used to love.

576
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,571
I don't want to be a woman that you love.
