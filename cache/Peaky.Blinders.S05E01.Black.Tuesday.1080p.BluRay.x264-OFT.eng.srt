1
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,045
Mr Shelby, you're not yourself.
I should call a doctor.

2
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:07,485
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,285
Michael, you're going to New York.

4
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:11,405
Why?

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:15,285
Because the company has business
to attend to in America.

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,685
You knew I was going to be shot...

7
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:21,045
...and you chose not to tell me.

8
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:23,645
I chose my mum.

9
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:29,965
<i>Thomas Shelby, Labour Party, 48,564!</i>

10
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,405
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.

11
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:41,965
It starts when you stop. When you rest.

12
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,325
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be resting.

13
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:03,565
I have learnt something, Frances.

14
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:08,485
There's no rest for me in this world.

15
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:10,605
<i>Perhaps in the next.</i>

16
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,325
Arthur.

17
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:33,725
"We cannot give you the assurance
you are asking for.

18
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:38,005
"We expect payment in full."

19
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:41,285
Here's my favourite part.

20
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:46,885
"We have never even heard
of your people,

21
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:51,285
"so we are not afraid of your threats."

22
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:57,325
And they've signed it
"the Angels of Retribution".

23
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,125
Hm.

24
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,325
They say
they haven't even heard of us.

25
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,965
So tell Aberama and Isiah to
introduce themselves.

26
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,445
And, Finn...

27
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,565
...you stay out of it.

28
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:15,965
Yeah.

29
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,925
Wait.

30
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:22,605
Wait, wait. Say that again.

31
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,725
No.

32
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,485
No, that cannot be possible!

33
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,885
Peter, my beautiful pilot...

34
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:07,725
Now will you please fly me
and my winnings back to England?

35
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,125
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me, please.

36
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,925
Where's that full one?

37
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,845
Look, Ruby.

38
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,485
Daddy's back from his call.

39
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,805
Everything's going to be all right now.

40
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:38,805
Oh, no, no.

41
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,445
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:53,205
Oh, no, no.

43
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:56,245
Ah!

44
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,725
Hello?

45
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,645
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?

46
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,525
Just get to him and tell him
that we've lost the lot.

47
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,565
Stay there. You stay put.

48
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,605
You'll hear from Tommy.

49
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,405
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?

50
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,405
<i>It's possible because, this morning</i>

51
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,885
in New York City at 6am,

52
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:27,485
the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed

53
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,405
<i>like a steam train.</i>

54
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,845
We were most definitely on board.

55
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,645
Fuck it.

56
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,245
- Oi! Come on, get changed!
- Jesus Christ!

57
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:58,845
Bring the car round!

58
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:09,325
We've got to get out of here.
Hurry up. Come on!

59
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,565
I'm going!

60
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,565
Change of plan.
We're not going to London any more.

61
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,645
- We're going straight to Birmingham.
- There are other passengers.

62
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,765
Not any more.

63
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:48,725
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

64
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:50,805
- No. No.
- I love you, you love me.

65
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,445
- That's the truth.
- Gina, wait, come on.

66
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,125
I want to meet your family.

67
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,285
No, you don't.

68
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:12,805
Argh!

69
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:42,245
Now you've heard of us.

70
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,605
Come on.

71
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,325
Couch. Couch!

72
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,885
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.

73
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,605
Be fucking careful.

74
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,885
She spends thousands of pounds
on this shit.

75
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,405
Argh!

76
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,005
- Get me some booze.
- Ah!

77
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:14,045
Just fucking get the thing out of me
and sew me up.

78
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:15,285
Just do it.

79
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,125
Peaky boy, give me your blade.

80
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:27,645
That's enough.

81
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,125
Don't want you throwing up
on your sister's furniture.

82
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:35,045
- You know what you're doing?
- I've done this a thousand times.

83
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:39,125
I once took a bullet from between
two ribs, one inch from the heart.

84
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,685
Mind you, it was a horse.

85
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,565
And the horse did die.

86
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,245
Hold him. Hold him.

87
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,125
There you go.

88
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,405
Just a little one.

89
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:04,645
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh, fuck.

90
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,485
Hello, Ada.

91
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:08,965
Get out, both of you.

92
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,045
Push this on the wound.

93
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,805
- Keep up the pressure.
- Get out.

94
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,405
I'm so sorry, Ada.

95
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,885
They broke a statue of some thin woman.

96
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,085
Fucking statues.

97
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,925
What has Tommy told you?

98
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,605
- Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.
- What?

99
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:34,085
- To maintain his fucking reputation?
- Oi!

100
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,525
You listen to me.

101
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,765
We've got a chance.

102
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,325
Tommy has given us that chance.

103
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:44,485
He's got power, we've got money
and our past is left behind us.

104
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:48,045
And you've got a precious young life,
Finn, you fucking idiot.

105
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,325
Three inches to the left
and that would have been gone.

106
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,445
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.

107
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:59,525
You have got nothing to prove.

108
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:09,125
Daddy! Daddy!

109
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,701
Come here, you. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

110
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,925
Ooh!

111
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,645
Now, what have you been up to, eh?

112
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,005
Get it done, Johnny.

113
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,605
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

114
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,765
Where's Charles?

115
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,365
He's in the wagon. He won't come out.

116
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:37,405
He heard Johnny talking Rokker.

117
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,885
He understands more Gypsy
than we think.

118
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,005
He heard him say you shot the horse.

119
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,205
I told him it was mercy. I said
it's what you do when a horse gets sick.

120
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,605
He doesn't understand.

121
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,885
Dad, why did you shoot him?

122
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,125
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.

123
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:02,525
Charles? Come here.

124
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,005
Sit down.

125
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:13,005
Now, listen to me.

126
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,045
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.

127
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:20,461
The vet couldn't do anything,
even Curly couldn't do anything.

128
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,685
I put him to sleep.

129
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,365
- It's what you do.
- No!

130
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,885
It's what <i>you</i> do.

131
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:30,645
Shoot horses, shoot people.
Everybody says.

132
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,805
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.

133
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,965
Too wild to race.

134
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,005
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.

135
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:21,925
Should have been a war horse.

136
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:25,245
Got tired of the pasture.

137
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:30,485
Couldn't stick the peace and quiet,
gave up on life...

138
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,445
...and is now free.

139
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:38,925
In the bleak...

140
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,005
You're crying.

141
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:19,765
Tom...

142
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:21,885
...I'm sorry.

143
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,925
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokker.

144
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,525
Fill it in, Johnny.

145
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,325
It's fine.

146
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:36,805
I've called the house, the office.

147
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,685
But if I tell you...

148
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,525
...you won't believe it...

149
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,605
...so I'll show you.

150
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:46,725
Huh?

151
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:03,005
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

152
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,885
Yeah.

153
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:11,525
Fucking Michael... said he was advised
by the broker that prices would rebound.

154
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,925
Everybody was told the same thing.

155
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:19,445
He held on.

156
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,445
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

157
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:37,325
Michael.

158
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,645
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

159
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:51,885
Michael held on...

160
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:56,605
...and carried on dancing and playing...

161
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,365
...and fucking in the snow.

162
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,485
Charlie!

163
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,685
Charlie, come out here now!

164
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,845
Kid never fucking listens.

165
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,045
Never listens, Lizzie.

166
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:18,925
What do I have to do
to make people fucking listen to me?!

167
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:21,165
Holy fuck.

168
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,045
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?

169
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:27,805
What do we do?

170
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:37,685
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to Birmingham,
you stay in the Midland Hotel.

171
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:42,525
Arthur, call a full meeting of
the board of directors tomorrow at noon.

172
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,365
A full fucking meeting.

173
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,165
What about today, eh?
What's wrong with today, Tom?

174
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,365
- I need to do some thinking.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:51,045
Oh, you do that best on your own,

176
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,965
- don't you, eh?
- I won't be on my own. Never on my own.

177
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:57,845
Lizzie, you have the driver
come back tomorrow.

178
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:01,045
And, Arthur, tell my boy...

179
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:05,525
...that sometimes death is a kindness.

180
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,845
Come on.

181
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:58,885
<i>What now?</i>

182
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,245
What am I, a genie?

183
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,645
You summon me up
with your little bottle of dope.

184
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:10,805
I take it for the pain, to keep warm.

185
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,165
Is that what it's for?

186
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:22,565
The warmth?

187
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:26,965
The warmth.

188
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,045
All this time.

189
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:34,925
I know.

190
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:39,685
Our love still remains.

191
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:46,005
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

192
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:50,685
Do what they tell you to do.

193
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,045
Too much to do, Grace.

194
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:58,965
The kids.

195
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:05,725
I need to say goodbye.

196
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,365
I need to sleep.

197
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:13,445
Just think, Tom.

198
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,005
Linda!

199
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:35,845
Oh, there you are, eh?

200
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,925
You're the chairman, Arthur,
so start acting like one.

201
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,405
Chairman, am I, hm?

202
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,925
No.

203
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:53,085
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda, hm?

204
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:57,165
And you ain't coming in here tonight,
love, dressed like that.

205
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:02,885
Tommy made me chairman so that...

206
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,365
...he could stay clean.

207
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,485
It's called an arrangement.

208
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,805
It's an opportunity.

209
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,085
I know who I am, Linda.

210
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:33,365
I know who I am and I'm all right with it.

211
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:35,805
Finally.

212
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:38,925
I can live with it.

213
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,685
I need you to be all right with it.

214
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:02,725
I need you to be all right with it, eh?

215
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:05,045
What is it, eh?

216
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:07,685
And what do you want, hm?

217
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,885
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?

218
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:17,925
With his fancy briefcase
and his gold fountain pen, eh?

219
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:21,645
What do you want?

220
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,165
Chairman...

221
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:27,565
...or doorman? Hm?

222
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,965
You think we can fuck and it'll be OK
and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.

223
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:37,085
Every week, your brother's down in London,
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,

224
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:40,565
champion of the people, while you're
up here running the racket for him.

225
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,101
And according to your "arrangement",
if anything should happen,

226
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,845
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time or swings for it.

227
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,245
- And what do you want?
- I want you...

228
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:57,365
...to take the opportunity

229
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:01,045
that God and the New York Stock Exchange
has presented to you.

230
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:04,325
Mr Shelby,
the meeting will be starting soon.

231
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,685
Yeah. All right.

232
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:10,125
Be right there.

233
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,125
Thank you, Edna.

234
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,725
And shut the door.

235
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,525
OK, now...

236
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,325
Mmm, they're nice.

237
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:00,485
...let's begin.

238
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:05,685
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

239
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,285
There was a terrible disaster. Hm?

240
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:12,645
It wasn't just for us.

241
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,325
It was for the whole world.

242
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,845
Happened in New York.

243
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:22,085
That's where it happened.

244
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:23,965
And it slowly spread to London.

245
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:28,685
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hm?

246
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,725
Whole thing... whole thing went up.

247
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:38,325
Well, actually the whole thing
went fucking down but...

248
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,565
...we wasn't the only ones hurt by this.

249
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:49,205
Whole world is hurt.

250
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:51,605
A lot of people.

251
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,405
In the papers.

252
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,125
It's all over the news.

253
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,165
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Arthur?

254
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,045
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

255
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:04,405
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

256
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:09,365
Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

257
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:14,565
I might lighten the gloom and express, as
a relatively new member of this company,

258
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:17,805
what a pleasure it is to be in a boardroom
that has so many females in it,

259
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:23,085
and all females who are both
sharp-witted and decorative.

260
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:26,565
Yeah, well, we're a very modern
company, Mr Greene.

261
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,685
Indeed.

262
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:33,125
Although there are still some among us
who cling to their old-fashioned values.

263
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:37,445
How far have we got?

264
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,125
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

265
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:42,845
We've only just sat down, Tom.

266
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:46,845
Actually, um, Arthur has some documents
that he'd like to hand out.

267
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:48,165
Yeah?

268
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:49,565
What documents?

269
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:55,565
I was just explaining to everyone, Tom,
that, um, well, we're fucked.

270
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:58,805
- Ain't that right? Hm?
- Yes and no.

271
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,845
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

272
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:07,085
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

273
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,445
Invested or hidden?

274
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,525
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

275
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:15,605
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

276
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:21,165
Linda, after this meeting there will
be another meeting, for just family.

277
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:23,365
Did we vote on this?

278
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,565
Arthur?

279
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,165
"Arthur, can't you control your wife?"

280
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:34,525
We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.

281
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,805
To be precise,
everything we channel led

282
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:45,045
through the New York Stock Exchange
is now offering a return

283
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,365
of ten cents to the dollar.

284
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:49,805
And the Nolan Bank of America,

285
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:52,405
where we invested our fluidity,

286
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:56,325
is offering five cents to the dollar
on all deposits.

287
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:58,965
Yeah.

288
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,045
- There is hope.
- Why?

289
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,605
What have you got in there,
a magic wand?

290
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:11,005
As non executive director of the company,
I need the permission from the chairman

291
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,965
to present my strategy to the board.

292
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,405
Permission granted, Tom.

293
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:03,885
The Peaky Blinders are coming.

294
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,325
The Peaky Blinders are coming.

295
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,765
Micky,
the Peaky Blinders are coming.

296
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:16,125
Ladies and gents, Peaky Blinders are
on their way. Please vacate. Thank you.

297
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:30,245
- Good to see you.
- All right, Mr Shelby.

298
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,805
- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?

299
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,205
...thank you for what you did.

300
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,565
What did I do?

301
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,085
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

302
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:39,565
Now he's cut our rent in half.

303
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,925
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

304
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:44,685
All right?

305
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,325
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

306
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:50,485
- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man.

307
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:54,525
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're saying
they're gonna cut my hours.

308
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,965
- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.

309
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,925
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

310
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,805
God bless you. God bless you both.

311
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,365
- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.

312
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:06,565
If you'll all move into the saloon bar,

313
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,005
where you will all be served
a free pint of stingo.

314
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:14,165
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

315
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:16,645
And in spite of what you're reading
in the newspapers,

316
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,845
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.

317
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,125
Fuck the stock market!

318
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:24,565
They backed the wrong horses,
so fucking what, eh?

319
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:29,045
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last,
a politician who gets things done.

320
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:30,845
You're welcome, brother, you're welcome.

321
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:32,621
- Get down off the furniture.
- Sorry, Ada.

322
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:33,965
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

323
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:39,645
Right.

324
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,565
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

325
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:45,685
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

326
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,605
Your husband believes that being seen

327
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:50,005
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

328
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,485
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

329
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:55,765
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't
wear earrings worth more than the pub.

330
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,725
Right. Family meeting. First item.

331
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:00,445
This.

332
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,645
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

333
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:06,165
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

334
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,845
Finn?

335
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,181
He says they were sent to Limehouse.

336
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:10,445
Chinatown.

337
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,165
Sent by fucking who?

338
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:13,405
Sent by me.

339
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:17,125
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

340
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,285
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

341
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:25,325
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

342
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:28,525
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

343
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:33,325
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

344
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,485
£50,000.

345
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,925
In cash.

346
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:41,085
He said they were sent to Chinatown
to kill somebody.

347
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,485
That kid needs educating, Tommy,
really does.

348
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,045
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

349
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,845
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

350
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,805
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

351
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,965
But you told Polly.

352
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:58,365
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

353
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,845
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?

354
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:05,485
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.

355
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:08,365
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

356
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:09,805
covered in flies.

357
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:11,645
World's a better place.

358
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:16,325
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

359
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,885
Sometimes, Ada...

360
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:23,085
...killing is a kindness.

361
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:24,525
Hm?

362
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,045
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

363
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:34,285
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

364
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:37,885
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

365
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:41,285
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

366
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:44,165
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

367
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:47,805
This was work commissioned
by a High Court judge, by Scotland Yard

368
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,245
and by the House of Lords.

369
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,845
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

370
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,485
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

371
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,365
Lizzie, you need to understand.

372
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,085
That you tell Polly, not me.

373
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:03,125
You need to understand that the corridors
of Westminster are very dimly lit.

374
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:06,565
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

375
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,085
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

376
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,285
<i>We? We</i> own the ropes, do we?

377
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:15,045
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened
to me, you wouldn't have known.

378
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,205
When we go home, I'll explain.

379
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:20,565
I can't be bothered
with this shit.

380
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,925
So...

381
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:31,125
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

382
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:34,165
The strategy I outlined earlier

383
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:37,805
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

384
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,525
- In the meantime...
- Just business as fucking usual.

385
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,245
In the meantime,
it is fortunate that we have maintained

386
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,725
other sources of cash income.

387
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:49,325
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

388
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,685
And cash we have.

389
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,525
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

390
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:54,125
You're gonna hang yourself.

391
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:59,525
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

392
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,005
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

393
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:04,365
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

394
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:06,365
Polly...

395
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:11,285
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

396
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:19,485
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

397
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:21,685
She's pregnant.

398
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,525
Ada's what?

399
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:29,085
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

400
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:30,405
Wait a minute.

401
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:31,725
Wait a minute.

402
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:35,685
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?

403
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:40,765
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

404
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:43,685
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck
who the father is.

405
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:45,005
Really?

406
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,405
I already know who the father is.

407
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:52,445
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

408
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,165
OK.

409
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,805
All right, go on, then.

410
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:14,645
How long you known about Ada, huh?

411
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:15,965
I know her doctor.

412
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:17,245
He calls me.

413
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:21,885
Yeah, longer than me.

414
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:23,085
Have a look at this.

415
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,685
What's that funny writing on there?

416
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,245
Chinese.

417
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,885
Ah, right.

418
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,685
What is it? Hmm?

419
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:42,245
Bad news?

420
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:44,405
Maybe.

421
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,245
Angels of Retribution?

422
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:49,485
Yeah.

423
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,965
Burn the letter they sent.

424
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,485
It's already done.

425
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:00,525
Look at that, Tom. Hm?

426
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,165
Pulled from our brother, eh?

427
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:07,605
Finally took a first bullet.

428
00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:10,605
No-one fucking listens to me.

429
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:16,685
Here, give it here.

430
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,165
I'll keep it for him.

431
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,885
I still have my first one.

432
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,565
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

433
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:36,085
Where are you going, brother?

434
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:13,365
The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

435
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:17,325
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

436
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:22,565
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

437
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:26,445
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

438
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:30,605
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

439
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:36,005
Mr Thomas Shelby.

440
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:38,885
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

441
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:44,525
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

442
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:47,725
asks that following the crash,

443
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:52,085
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

444
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:57,245
What he's really asking
is that the working man carry the can.

445
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,325
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

446
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:08,485
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

447
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:13,765
by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver
hats, who, when they lose their bets,

448
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:16,125
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

449
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:21,365
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

450
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:24,925
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

451
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:29,165
that those who so recklessly lost
their fortunes on the capitalist lottery

452
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,645
learn to shine their own shoes...

453
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,845
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

454
00:38:43,845 --> 00:38:44,845
Mr Shelby?

455
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:49,125
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

456
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:50,725
You speak very eloquently.

457
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:52,565
Thank you.

458
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:57,165
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

459
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:58,285
Yeah, I know who you are.

460
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,645
My constituency borders yours.

461
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:04,125
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

462
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,085
Come.

463
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,485
Ah.

464
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,645
I have bad news, Mr...

465
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:23,525
Shelby.

466
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:28,445
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

467
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:32,565
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

468
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:34,765
There's 20 there.

469
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,725
You'll have to wait for the rest.

470
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:50,605
Cavalry, eh?

471
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,525
Mm.

472
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:53,685
Huh!

473
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,005
Yeah.

474
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,565
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

475
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:06,765
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

476
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:09,445
When the cavalry finally came,

477
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:13,205
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

478
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:18,085
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

479
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:23,085
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

480
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:25,965
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

481
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:28,605
All for a game of chance.

482
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:34,725
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

483
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:38,525
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

484
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,725
that will cause you concern.

485
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:43,005
I now have them in a safe place.

486
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:48,885
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

487
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,685
...or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

488
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:58,605
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

489
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,285
in a place of power and privilege?

490
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:02,845
A man like me?

491
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:08,605
A man like me?

492
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,885
Lord Suckerby.

493
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,405
I've seen the photographs.

494
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:17,085
Monday.

495
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:25,485
Shelby!

496
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:28,445
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

497
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:31,245
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

498
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:34,645
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

499
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:37,005
- Right.
- Everything all right?

500
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,645
Yeah, fine.

501
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,085
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

502
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,205
Your brother been busy?

503
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:47,645
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

504
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:49,765
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

505
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,485
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

506
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:53,725
he's setting up a meeting -

507
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,805
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby,

508
00:41:57,925 --> 00:42:02,565
organised by two Communist convenors
not formerly known to Special Branch.

509
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:05,605
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

510
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:09,245
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

511
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:11,765
But he'll report more when he sees her.

512
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,005
It's all in there, though.

513
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,565
Names and everything.

514
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:17,421
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

515
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:21,005
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

516
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,365
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

517
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:26,485
Times are hard.

518
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,005
Hm.

519
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,125
Exactly how much did you lose?

520
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:37,765
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

521
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:41,925
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

522
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:45,485
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

523
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,925
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces
of desperate men."

524
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:53,445
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

525
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:57,845
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

526
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,965
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

527
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:18,645
Fuck.

528
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,485
Come.

529
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:29,125
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

530
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:30,885
It's from Winston Churchill.

531
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,565
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin

532
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:37,885
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

533
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:40,845
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

534
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:43,365
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

535
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:48,365
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost £75,000 in two hours.

536
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:51,605
And you?

537
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:56,205
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

538
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:58,605
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

539
00:43:58,725 --> 00:43:59,725
You lock up.

540
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:03,725
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

541
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:06,245
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

542
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:07,845
A journalist from the <i>Times.</i>

543
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:09,725
He used to be with
the <i>Birmingham Mail.</i>

544
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:11,605
He sent you some questions.

545
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,565
You said you wanted to meet him.

546
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:14,685
He's outside.

547
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:16,765
Yes.

548
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:18,965
Send him in.

549
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:27,445
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>

550
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,285
Have a seat.

551
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,405
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

552
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:40,485
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

553
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:44,245
No.

554
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:49,165
Once, in Small Heath,
you were burning photographs of the King.

555
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:55,405
- <i>London Times.</i> You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

556
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,645
I sent you a list of questions.

557
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:59,845
Yeah, I misplaced them.

558
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:02,965
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

559
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:04,285
Yes.

560
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:07,205
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

561
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,085
Oh!

562
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:10,485
Good.

563
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,445
Sorry, just...

564
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:15,165
Ah, here we are.

565
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:17,725
Yes, um...

566
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:24,845
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

567
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:29,765
print journalists take no interest in the,
er, the private lives of politicians.

568
00:45:29,885 --> 00:45:31,845
Private lives?

569
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:36,045
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

570
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:40,925
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

571
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:42,925
Readers are beginning to say...

572
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,205
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

573
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:48,605
Of course.

574
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:50,645
In these modern times.

575
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:55,005
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

576
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:58,925
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

577
00:45:59,045 --> 00:46:01,925
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

578
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:03,565
I'm no gentleman.

579
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:08,525
Hm.

580
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:11,885
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

581
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,725
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

582
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:19,085
And of course, working in that city,

583
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:22,005
it was impossible
not to know your name...

584
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:26,085
...and your reputation.

585
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:31,845
So, when I saw that you had
been elected as a socialist...

586
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,285
You reflected on the fact

587
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:39,085
that working people can indeed change
their lives for the better...

588
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:44,725
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

589
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:50,205
aim for happier outcomes,
even win awards for industry.

590
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,085
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

591
00:46:52,205 --> 00:46:55,605
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

592
00:46:57,165 --> 00:47:02,045
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

593
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:05,045
a gradual thing or...

594
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:09,965
...a road to Damascus experience?

595
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,725
Yeah.

596
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:14,725
Now I hear that question...

597
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:18,245
...I remember receiving your letters

598
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:21,525
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

599
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:26,045
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

600
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:30,445
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

601
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:31,805
But, since 1923,

602
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:35,365
I've made my fortune in the manufacture,
sale and export of motor cars.

603
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,925
And lately gin.

604
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:40,525
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

605
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:45,245
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

606
00:47:46,525 --> 00:47:49,165
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

607
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:53,765
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

608
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:56,125
there was a Major Campbell.

609
00:47:57,445 --> 00:47:58,645
He was found dead.

610
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:01,725
A member of your family was charged.

611
00:48:11,045 --> 00:48:13,885
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

612
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:19,885
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

613
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:22,525
Is it evolution or revolution?

614
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:26,165
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

615
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:29,645
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

616
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:34,765
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

617
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:37,125
I am talking about specific events, sir.

618
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:38,245
Which I don't recall...

619
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:42,365
...with which I was never
personally linked,

620
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:45,965
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

621
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:57,445
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...

622
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:00,885
...and I recall that when I did...

623
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,725
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

624
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:10,645
Just a moment.

625
00:49:16,045 --> 00:49:18,725
Here we are.

626
00:49:27,245 --> 00:49:29,845
Ah, Michael Levitt.

627
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:30,965
Correct?

628
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,365
- Yes.
- Yes.

629
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,925
Journalist.

630
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,045
Unmarried.

631
00:49:38,165 --> 00:49:40,005
An apartment in Maida Vale.

632
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:44,525
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

633
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:49,365
"Unmarried" is underlined.

634
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:52,565
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

635
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:54,205
Sometimes alone.

636
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,365
Sometimes not alone.

637
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:00,165
Sometimes with other men.

638
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:10,205
Sometimes with other men.

639
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:16,685
I'm old-fashioned... Michael.

640
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:20,325
I believe private lives
should remain private.

641
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:24,005
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

642
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:29,645
You gonna write this down...

643
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:33,205
...in your little fucking book?

644
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:42,805
Well?

645
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:44,725
Not yet.

646
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:46,525
I didn't tell him.

647
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:49,925
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we're drinking.

648
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:52,485
It's vintage.

649
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,125
Fuck it.

650
00:50:57,245 --> 00:50:58,565
This...

651
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:01,525
...is for us.

652
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,405
Let's drink to the baby.

653
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:10,205
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

654
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,685
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

655
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,765
I was going to get rid of it.

656
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:19,045
What about this time?

657
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:23,845
Imagine.

658
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:28,125
The father's scared.

659
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:29,925
He runs away.

660
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,205
You're left.

661
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:35,485
Oh, sweetheart.

662
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:40,805
The baby's black,
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

663
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:43,765
But you don't care.

664
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,285
Because the world has changed.

665
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:51,045
And the baby's eyes are golden.

666
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:55,845
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

667
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:59,205
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

668
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,405
How do you know it's a her?

669
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:04,565
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

670
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:06,445
It's a girl?

671
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:07,565
Golden.

672
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:12,045
To be born in the year 1930,

673
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,885
where everything will be changed
for the better.

674
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:19,525
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

675
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,205
What will Tommy say?

676
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:29,085
Tommy knows.

677
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:33,765
Hmm!

678
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:38,605
He's also seen that the world's
big and round and he says, "So what?"

679
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:45,725
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

680
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,565
We are flying above the rules now.

681
00:52:52,525 --> 00:52:54,965
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

682
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:57,885
That's the beauty.

683
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,325
Hello, Cyril.

684
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,045
Least you're still talking to me.

685
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:28,085
Where is everyone?

686
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,045
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

687
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:39,845
You know, Frances, if there were to be
a snap election in this house today...

688
00:53:41,445 --> 00:53:42,725
...wouldn't win it...

689
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,605
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

690
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:47,725
No.

691
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:49,965
- I gathered.
- Mm.

692
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:53,285
Where's Charles?

693
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:54,645
Charles is in the stable.

694
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:58,085
Thank you.

695
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,445
Did Arthur explain?

696
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:21,405
He said it's God's will.

697
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:24,885
But you're not God!

698
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:37,765
No, I'm not God.

699
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:43,845
Not yet.
