1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,667
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,371
Well, you really have
buggered everything up this time.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,082
<i>Guys, I think we broke time.</i>

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,793
As you can see, my agents
are hard at work dealing with these

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,254
<i>- anachronisms that you created.</i>
- Anachronisms?

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,617
<i>People, places and things</i>

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,241
<i>displaced from
their native time periods.</i>

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,554
I am Gaius Julius Caesar of Rome.

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,040
<i>I told you I was leaving
to create an organization</i>

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,166
<i>to replace the Time Masters.</i>

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,460
Rip doesn't think he needs us
now that he's got the Time Bureau.

12
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,794
Because the Time Bureau is capable of

13
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,356
getting the job done
without the mess.

14
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,841
We're the ones who broke history,
we should be the ones that fix it.

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,606
- Problem solved.
- I gotta say, Ms. Lance.

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,887
<i>Now that I've seen your team
in action with my own eyes...</i>

17
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,911
Howdy.

18
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,204
You're even worse than I imagined.

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,056
Don't look.

20
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,552
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,758
I live here.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
What's all this?

23
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,914
What part of,
"I'm making you a birthday surprise.

24
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,021
"Stay out of the apartment"
did you not understand?

25
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:09,397
I thought you meant
lingerie and, you know, sex,

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,603
not whatever this is.

27
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,691
I'm making donuts.
Chocolate covered donuts.

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,012
'Cause you said they were
your favorite when you were little.

29
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,368
You're making them from scratch?

30
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,702
How else would I make them?

31
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,789
You'd do what my mom did.

32
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,227
You go to the corner store
and you get them for two bucks a box.

33
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,117
Nobody makes anything
from scratch anymore.

34
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,372
So all this was for nothing?

35
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,875
No. Donuts are never for nothing.

36
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,252
And, being creative,

37
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,380
I'm sure I can figure out a way
to use that chocolate sauce.

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,506
Mmm.

39
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,851
I got it. Don't worry.

40
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,148
All right. Five-second rule.
We're good. It's okay.

41
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,897
- I'll make some more.
- No, you are done.

42
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,190
You can't do anything else.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,647
We're doing the rest of this
2017 style.

44
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,741
Where are you going?

45
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,111
I'm going to the corner store

46
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,194
to get us chocolate covered donuts
the way my mom used to buy them.

47
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,328
<i>Tonight's breaking
news, Vixen caught on camera.</i>

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,330
<i>This video is rare footage of Vixen,
Detroit's own superheroine,</i>

49
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,151
<i>Who has waged a one-person war</i>

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,713
<i>against drug dealers
and corrupt cops alike</i>

51
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,465
<i>since she first appeared in the city
three years ago.</i>

52
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,352
All right, I got
all of my mom's favorites.

53
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,014
I got chocolate donuts,

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,016
crumb cake...

55
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,691
Hello?

56
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,199
Amaya?

57
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,873
<i>Hello?</i>

58
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,700
Hello? Anybody home? McFly?

59
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,088
Sorry I was just...
Thinking about donuts.

60
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,958
Okay, so where are we?

61
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,795
I was saying I reverse-engineered
the Time Bureau tech

62
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,379
that Mick stole from Rip.

63
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,261
Now we can locate anachronisms, too.

64
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,263
- Nice work, man.
- Also, check this out.

65
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,553
Our run-in with Caesar
got me thinking.

66
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,516
What if there was a way to contain
the anachronisms we pick up,

67
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,337
and not have them
causing trouble on the ship,

68
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,647
or taking things they shouldn't?

69
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,228
Yeah, that's what
we got the brig for.

70
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,188
Well, what if we have
another L.A. situation?

71
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,740
Try putting a dinosaur
in the brig. Huh?

72
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,943
- Not gonna happen.
- No.

73
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,916
- Unless it's an Aquilops.
- Or a Compsognathus.

74
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,112
Or a cute little Oviraptor.

75
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,323
Oh, okay. So, how do we contain them?

76
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,534
We make it smaller.

77
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,292
You built a Shrink Ray?

78
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,790
Not particularly fond of that name.

79
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,581
I'm calling it
the Hyper Molecular Compressor.

80
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,009
It's a more powerful and portable
version of the tech from my suit.

81
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,337
- So a Shrink Ray?
- Essentially.

82
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,428
I perfected the work
I was moonlighting on at Upswipz.

83
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,398
Nice.

84
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,728
It'll return to normal size
in 24 hours,

85
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,269
or if you don't want to wait...

86
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,899
Oh, you're on fire, dude.

87
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,905
All right, let's gather
the rest of the team

88
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,952
and check out the new anachronism map.

89
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,158
We really messed up time.

90
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,204
Looks like we gave time acne.

91
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,753
Each of these dots represents
an anachronism we created

92
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,876
by breaking time.

93
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,549
Rip's Bureau rates them
on a scale of one to ten

94
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,719
according to their magnitude
of impact and potential difficulty.

95
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,514
Gideon, can you analyze this data?

96
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,225
<i>Certainly, Dr. Palmer.</i>

97
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,473
Look at all of these.

98
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,101
It's gonna take a lifetime
to clean up this mess. Maybe several.

99
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,334
Where should we start?

100
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,101
What about Great Wall of China,
level 6?

101
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,188
I ate Chinese last night.
Where can I get a steak?

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,194
How about the North Atlantic Ocean,
April 1912?

103
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,071
I hear the <i>Titanic</i> had amazing food.

104
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,529
Absolutely not.
I refuse to set foot on the <i>Titanic.</i>

105
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,330
Whoever built that ship
ought to be shot.

106
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,127
Anyways, I'm sure
Little Miss Time Bureau

107
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,954
would love to see us mess this up.

108
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,665
So let's find something easy,
a nice slam dunk.

109
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,594
Ooh. Wisconsin, 1870?
It's a level 1.

110
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,341
<i>Oh, I do hope
you choose that one.</i>

111
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,798
<i>The anachronism is located
at the grounds</i>

112
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,556
<i>of P.T. Barnum's Roving Museum
of Freaks and Hypnotic Hippodrome.</i>

113
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,057
<i>Although he is erroneously credited</i>

114
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,267
<i>with the phrase,
"There's a sucker born every minute,"</i>

115
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,442
<i>in truth, Mr. Barnum would have never
belittled paying customers.</i>

116
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,571
Perfect. We're bringing the circus
to the circus.

117
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,403
This is a classic slice of Americana.

118
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,452
The air is thick with the smell
of popcorn, candy, and wonder.

119
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,954
If I see a clown, I'm outta here.

120
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,448
What, you're afraid of clowns?

121
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,831
No, I just don't like
their stupid faces.

122
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,206
And funny shoes.

123
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,413
And razor sharp teeth.

124
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,748
Their what?

125
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,677
All right, guys, if you were
an anachronism hiding in the circus,

126
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,798
where would you be?

127
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,925
How about in there?

128
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,062
King Tut's Tomb? No way.

129
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,251
No way indeed.

130
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,187
They covered it in flour
to make it look old.

131
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,776
Bearded Lady, hormone imbalance.

132
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,607
<i>And Mr. Rory would make
a far more convincing Cro-Magnon.</i>

133
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,238
Marty, you can't look
behind the curtain. Spoils the fun.

134
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,115
Fun? Tricks and humbug are all I see.

135
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,073
And these uneducated rubes
come here in droves,

136
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,166
begging to be fooled.

137
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,039
No, people want to live in a world
where anything is possible.

138
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,421
They want to be amazed.

139
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,963
Yes, and amazing as this is,
we're wasting time.

140
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,049
Let's split up.

141
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,126
Ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,927
welcome one and all

143
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,514
to the best show on Earth!

144
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,384
That is a working title.

145
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,639
My roving show of wonders

146
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,986
has the most remarkable of oddities
in store for you today.

147
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,697
Is it beautiful?

148
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,781
The very definition.

149
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,653
Is it deadly?

150
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,037
It can take your head
from your shoulders in a single bite.

151
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,332
What makes this creature
such a marvel,

152
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,505
is that it has been extinct
for the last 10,000 years.

153
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,734
Are you guys hearing this?

154
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,841
Could be our anachronism.

155
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,927
Or another humbug.

156
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,468
Check it out just to be safe.

157
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,886
This exclusive, once in a lifetime
opportunity could be yours

158
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,184
for only a nickel.

159
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,305
Yo. What's that smell?

160
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,636
Oh.

161
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,805
- Where there's poop...
- There's a prize!

162
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,771
- Check it out.
- Do we have to?

163
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,276
This is definitely feline feces,
but unlike any I've ever seen.

164
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,948
You've studied
a lot of poop, big guy?

165
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,777
As an Eagle Scout, I can interpret
175 different droppings.

166
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,159
The color and viscosity indicate
a carnivorous diet,

167
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,497
but this movement took
a long time to pass.

168
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,750
The meat looks like it was tough.
Like rhinoceros or elephant hide.

169
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,628
I speak of a creature
that comes to you

170
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,551
from the distant past.

171
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,763
I know what our anachronism is.

172
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,135
Contain it quick.

173
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,263
<i>We can't let these people
see the anachronism.</i>

174
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,265
<i>We don't want this to get any worse.</i>

175
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,814
Bingo.

176
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,645
Gentlemen, may I present to you

177
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,610
the saber-toothed tiger.

178
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,024
Oh. Whoa.

179
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,158
Did I mention that
I'm allergic to cats?

180
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,073
Please tell me
you brought your shrink ray.

181
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,872
Molecular Hyper Compressor and yes.

182
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,301
Ray...

183
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,129
Shrinking a vase is very different
from shrinking an extinct tiger.

184
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,839
Okay? I have to account for speed,
lifespan, gender.

185
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,133
You think that's a male or a female?

186
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,760
I think it's awake.

187
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,466
- Ray, shoot it! Just shoot it!
- A few more adjustments...

188
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,778
Oh, no.

189
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,567
Are you guys okay? I heard a roar.

190
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,069
Looks like our problem got
a whole lot bigger.

191
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,989
Let me get this straight.

192
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,329
You three released
a giant saber-toothed tiger?

193
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,754
"Release" isn't the word I'd use.

194
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,423
Yeah. More like, uh, "didn't contain."

195
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,838
Gideon, what's the status
of the anachronism?

196
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,716
<i>The anachronism has elevated
from level 1 to level 4.</i>

197
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,422
What? How is that even a thing?

198
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,132
We've made it worse, that's how.

199
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,344
So we just get Ray some allergy
medicine and we go back out there.

200
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,805
None of us even have experience
with animals.

201
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,190
Stay on the ship.
Stay out of trouble.

202
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,652
Where the hell is she going?

203
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,251
Hey, girl.

204
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,959
How 'bout one final mission?

205
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,593
For old times sake.

206
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,851
I can't go with you, Sara.

207
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,732
I'm not asking you to join back up.

208
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,939
Just one easy mission.

209
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,274
Trapping a giant saber-toothed tiger
is easy?

210
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,702
For you. Your powers are
the quickest way to handle this.

211
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,823
Look, Amaya,
I can't give the Time Bureau

212
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,499
an excuse to
take the <i>Waverider</i> again.

213
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,085
I want to help you.

214
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,288
But my life's
a little complicated right now.

215
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,965
Amaya.

216
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,134
Foyinsola, this is Sara.

217
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,635
Hey. What you got there?

218
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,383
I found it in an acacia tree.

219
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,007
Help! Please!

220
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,639
You should be asleep, little one.

221
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,564
Now run along to bed

222
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,860
before I have to summon
the ashe of a cobra to scare you.

223
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,199
Normal life, it suits you.

224
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,118
You seem at peace here.

225
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,411
Goodbye, Amaya.

226
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,705
It was good to see you.

227
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,091
Wait.

228
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,256
Does Nathaniel know
that I'd be returning?

229
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,139
Yeah.

230
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,260
He's thrilled.

231
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,264
I raise the pot one. Dishes duty.

232
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,474
All right, Professor, you sly fox.

233
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,060
I will raise you one... Amaya?

234
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,191
Can't bet what you
already lost, pretty.

235
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,024
Hello, Nathaniel.

236
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,697
Amaya! What's good, girl?

237
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,369
How you been?

238
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,540
Ah.

239
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,251
I missed you.

240
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,832
- Hello.
- Professor Stein.

241
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,623
Ship's not the same without you.

242
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,630
But we're fine without you.
Everything's running smoothly.

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>Is that right?</i>

244
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,505
Haircut here embiggened
an extinct tiger.

245
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,386
Which Amaya and I
are going to catch.

246
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,056
Then I have to return to Zambesi.

247
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,207
But we're gonna need
your shrink ray, Ray.

248
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,564
I thought we talked about
not calling it that.

249
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,186
And don't you need the rest of us?

250
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,896
- We can handle it.
<i>- Really?</i>

251
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,069
You don't want us to come along
and mess things up?

252
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,646
Enjoy your night.

253
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,692
You didn't tell Nathaniel, did you?

254
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,037
It's cool.

255
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,830
This is so not cool.

256
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,208
First, Amaya ghosts on me
on my birthday, no heads up.

257
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,916
Then, she shows back up on the ship,
again, no heads up.

258
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,547
Bro, she's from 1942.

259
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,237
Did you really think
that was gonna work?

260
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,092
Well, I thought we were happy.

261
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,225
What happened?

262
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,052
I don't know. But instead of drinking
maybe you should go find out.

263
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,933
No. She didn't want to talk, then.
Why would she want to talk now?

264
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,975
And look, I don't want to
sound like a jerk,

265
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,022
but she kind of let herself go.

266
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,899
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, buddy.

267
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,736
The tiger's heading east.

268
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,328
Looks like he stopped here
to sharpen his claws.

269
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,168
Don't tell me the infamous Sara Lance
is scared of a big cat.

270
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,794
Giant tiger.

271
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,332
Don't worry. To animals,
humans are the predators.

272
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,671
Even to other humans.

273
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,388
Whatever you do, don't run.

274
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,226
I spent my last greenback
on that feline oddity.

275
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,444
The circus is shutting down.

276
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,236
You know I'd rather die
before going back to Salem, Phineas.

277
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,901
There's some small-minded folk
back there.

278
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,116
Small-minded folk everywhere.

279
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,542
Even the most retrograde ingrate
wants to be entertained.

280
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,836
The human spirit longs for
edification and delight.

281
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,761
We just need a showstopper
to edify and delight them!

282
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,048
- Are you on Upswipz?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,474
Connected through the <i>Waverider.</i>

284
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,392
This is Cindy, 5'9".

285
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,813
Profession, weather reporter.
Loves kale.

286
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,731
Said she wants to meet up.
That's nice.

287
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,024
"Do you have a time machine?"

288
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,072
- Just talk to Amaya.
- That's what Jax said.

289
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,367
Wait. Are you two conspiring...

290
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,115
Are you conspiring against me?

291
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,411
Hey!

292
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,747
You owe the lady an apology.

293
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,709
That's not a lady, that's a freak.

294
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,882
Are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

295
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,009
Because I would love to get into
a fight right now.

296
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,317
If she's a freak, what am I?

297
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,362
That was marvelous!

298
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,239
A round of drinks on me.

299
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,558
It's actually time for us to be going.

300
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,164
No, come on, wait. We just met.

301
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,867
Please, are you going to tell me,

302
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,374
where did you learn
a humbug like that?

303
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,420
Oh, that was no humbug, P to the T.

304
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,499
See, people like us,
we gotta stick together.

305
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,255
And by the way, your beard,
it's beautiful.

306
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,587
- You're so sweet.
- She said I'm sweet.

307
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,138
I'm sorry. "People like us?"

308
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,762
Yeah, my friend Jax here
turns into fire and flies.

309
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,560
No, that's just the whiskey talking.
Right, buddy?

310
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,764
No, it's true. And my friend
Ray here, turns teeny-weeny.

311
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,358
"Teeny-weeny"?

312
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,231
- Very funny, Nate.
- Also, they're both capable of flight.

313
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,396
But if you want to know
a real freak, P.T...

314
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,072
It's my ex-girlfriend.

315
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,651
She can summon the power
of any animal.

316
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,995
Is that right?

317
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,570
I have an idea, fellas.

318
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,083
How about we meet,
retire back to the circus

319
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,038
for a little private show?

320
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,708
Where I guarantee I've got
the most beautiful

321
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,666
and flexible acrobats
you've ever seen.

322
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,384
P.T. Barnum, you're on.

323
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,591
You had me at "circus."

324
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,554
Shouldn't you ashe up?

325
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,728
No. That will just provoke him.

326
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,848
Move downwind.

327
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,641
I'll distract and you shrink.

328
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,529
Easy.

329
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,942
I'm not here to hurt you.

330
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,411
It's kind of cute.

331
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,792
Well, I'm glad
Nate finally took our advice

332
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,168
and went to talk to Amaya.

333
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,502
True. But, man,
he is about to miss out.

334
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,010
I thought we needed the Tin Man.

335
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,897
In due time.

336
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,016
We have his friends.

337
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,647
Oh, smile, Hildy, we just might
save the circus yet.

338
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,578
Hey, Sunshine!

339
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,241
What're you doing in my room?

340
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,704
Oh, this is not my room.

341
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,922
Where are Jax and Ray?

342
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,791
Shh. Yelling.

343
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,295
I'm gonna die. I don't remember.

344
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,069
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

345
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Whiskey.

346
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,519
So much...

347
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,482
It's all coming back to me.

348
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,153
We were headed to the circus
for a private show.

349
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,574
And what, you decided to peel off
and sleep in the cargo bay?

350
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,370
How could you abandon your own team?

351
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,656
Yeah, you're one to talk.

352
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,493
All right, let's stop wasting time.
Let's go.

353
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,920
The loss of my saber-toothed tiger
was indeed a blow.

354
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,253
But the fates have smiled on me again

355
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:22,512
because the "God of Fire"
and the "Incredible Shrinking Man"

356
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,639
have joined my troop.

357
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,429
Think we've had
a slight misunderstanding.

358
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,765
And I am truly grateful

359
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,772
that you have not used your
special abilities to try to escape.

360
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,728
Special abilities? Man...

361
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,404
Like I told you before,

362
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,502
- that was just the liquor talking.
- Uh-huh.

363
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,693
He's right, okay?

364
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,450
My friend and I, we're just regular
plain ole folk from 1870.

365
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,123
Dishonesty is not your strong suit,
my good man.

366
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,328
I saw what your friend did.
That was no trick.

367
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:56,592
And he says you two
are capable of wonders

368
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,339
just as marvelous.

369
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,632
So, chop, chop. Don't be shy.

370
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,016
- We can't.
- Ah, poppycock.

371
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,561
He's right. He can't fire up
without his partner, who's not here.

372
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,812
And I can't shrink without
my exosuit. Also not here.

373
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,646
So you might as well just let us go
'cause we are obviously useless.

374
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,775
Totally useless.

375
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,948
Don't worry.

376
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,695
I'll make marvels out of you yet.

377
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,362
You said Ray and Jax would be here.

378
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,826
They're probably eating
breakfast sandwiches

379
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,915
and a handful of Aspirin.

380
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,875
Or maybe they're in trouble.

381
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,169
Here? This place is harmless.

382
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,917
Then why are we being watched?

383
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,048
Guy in the hat? Six o'clock?

384
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,135
That guy?

385
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,361
Gary?

386
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,778
Nice work, Nathaniel.

387
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,105
What, you think I spooked him?

388
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,065
The smell of your breath alone
would be enough.

389
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,992
You know what?
You don't get to criticize me.

390
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,240
And you know why?

391
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,822
Because you're no longer
a member of this team.

392
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,292
- You're right.
- I am?

393
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,460
I don't blame you for going out
and getting pie-eyed last night.

394
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,712
That's cool. I don't blame you
for saying "pie-eyed."

395
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,843
My point is,

396
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,842
Sara should have told you that she
was bringing me back from Zambesi.

397
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,549
- It must have been upsetting when...
- Whoa. Hang on.

398
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,426
You think last night
was because of you?

399
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,228
My God, Amaya, you are so conceited.

400
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,142
Last night wasn't even
remotely about you. At all.

401
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,235
What was it about?

402
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,423
It was about me and the boys
doing what we do, hanging out.

403
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,609
Sharing a few laughs,
having a few drinks.

404
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,573
Ending up in a freak show.

405
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,831
Mmm.

406
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,165
You like meat, huh?

407
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,091
Here we go.

408
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,428
Come back here,
you little rat bastard!

409
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,021
I don't understand. Who is this man
and why have we taken him prisoner?

410
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,890
Professor Stein, meet Gary.

411
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,984
Please don't kill me.

412
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,232
I won't if you tell us
why you were tailing us.

413
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,322
You two know each other?

414
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,819
Gary here works
for Rip's Time Bureau.

415
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,153
And I'm guessing Agent Sharpe
had her little stooge spying on us.

416
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,612
Isn't that right, Gary?

417
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,540
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the nature of my...

418
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,118
All right, yes.
She sent me to spy on you.

419
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,461
Good thing, too.
Since you arrived here,

420
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,664
the anachronism has jumped
from a level 1 to level 6.

421
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,465
<i>We found the saber-tooth.</i>

422
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,793
And it is safe and sound in its cage.

423
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,630
So I don't know how we could've
made the anachronism worse.

424
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,466
My guess is we can thank
our two missing teammates for that.

425
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,681
Nate, Amaya, please tell me
you found the Hardy Boys.

426
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,184
Let's just hope they had
the good sense to stick together.

427
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,536
Oh, they're stuck together
all right.

428
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,068
P.T. Barnum has them dressed
as conjoined twins.

429
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,611
Guys, get us out of here.

430
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,108
Man, I thought I had a rough night.

431
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,199
Not funny, Nate.

432
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,115
Come on, this harness
is really uncomfortable.

433
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,693
I got this.

434
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,003
I must be dehydrated.

435
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,456
This never happened to me before,
I swear.

436
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,959
- Where have I heard that one before?
- Not from me.

437
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,384
She never heard that from me.

438
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,298
Amaya, an elephant ashe would
come in really handy right now.

439
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,903
Well...

440
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,775
Look who joined the circus.

441
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,235
We're going to need a bigger tent.

442
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,252
I take it you're still too dehydrated
to get us out of here?

443
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,673
Oh, God.

444
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,841
Stop judging me.
Just summon your animal powers.

445
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,261
Believe me, you do not want me using
this totem right now.

446
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
What does that mean?

447
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,811
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

448
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,015
For what?
For not using your powers

449
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,272
or ditching me on my birthday
to hitch a ride back to Zambesi?

450
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,316
I didn't go to Zambesi.
Not right away.

451
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,903
First I went to Detroit.

452
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,535
Detroit?

453
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,285
I had to see her in person.

454
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,408
Mari, my granddaughter.

455
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,416
I had to see if she was as incredible
as people said she was.

456
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,380
I watched her save five people
in one night.

457
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:55,341
She never knew I was there,
but I knew that she was perfect.

458
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,677
<i>I know it doesn't help,</i>

459
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:03,186
but my decision to leave
had nothing to do with you.

460
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,059
You're right, it doesn't.

461
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,901
'Cause if your badass granddaughter
was in 2017,

462
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,857
why did you have to go back to 1942?

463
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,659
I asked Rip the same question.

464
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,655
He said that time
hadn't yet solidified,

465
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,246
but if I stayed too long in 2017,

466
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,373
then Mari would disappear.

467
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,705
Why didn't you say anything?

468
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,168
I hated you for what you did.

469
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,629
I needed you to hate me.

470
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,219
So that you would move on.

471
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,719
If you knew how much it hurt me...

472
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,100
I would have found you.

473
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:48,944
I wanted to protect my granddaughter
and I wanted to protect you.

474
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,612
Well, no offense, Amaya,

475
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,232
but considering we're both stuck
in a rhino cage,

476
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,192
I'd say your plan backfired.

477
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,209
This is Agent 1066.

478
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,579
<i>You failed to turn in
your status report, Gary.</i>

479
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,630
<i>And then you ignored my attempts
to contact you.</i>

480
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,710
<i>Somehow, during all of that,
the level 1 has escalated</i>

481
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,718
<i>to a level 8.</i>

482
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,591
<i>And where the hell are you?</i>

483
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,093
<i>Is that the</i> Waverider?

484
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>I told you to keep an eye
on the Legends, not to join them.</i>

485
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,478
Um...

486
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,185
Turns out, the Legends
had things under control.

487
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,600
It was my interference with their,

488
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,437
to be honest,
expert handling of the situation

489
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,192
which caused things to, well...

490
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,857
- Escalate.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

491
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,243
<i>Gary, if you're in over your head,
I can send back-up immediately.</i>

492
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,619
No. Uh... No back up.

493
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,369
Like I said, the Legends
have things under control.

494
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,456
Uh, nice chatting. Gotta go.

495
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,921
- How'd I do?
- You were great.

496
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,924
I can sense that Jefferson
is extremely nervous.

497
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,886
Don't worry.
We just have to rescue the team

498
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,101
and get back on the ship before
that saber-tooth embiggens.

499
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,184
At least we know why the scale
of the anachronism keeps climbing.

500
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,815
P.T. Barnum with real superheroes.

501
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,192
He'll expose Nate and Amaya
to the entire world.

502
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,922
<i>I'm detecting increased
chronometric interference, Captain.</i>

503
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,871
<i>Agent Sharpe has
boarded the</i> Waverider.

504
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,241
Get Rory.
You two have to save the others.

505
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,748
Wait, the two of us? Are you mad?

506
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,295
You can do this. I have faith in you.

507
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,673
Why?

508
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,167
Just go! I'll hold her off
as long as I can.

509
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,893
Sara Lance,
on behalf of the Time Bureau,

510
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,095
I'm placing you and your team
under arrest.

511
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,392
Took you long enough.

512
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,683
I've been expecting you for hours.

513
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,900
Pursuant to Title 16, Section 3053
of the Global Treaty on Time Travel,

514
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,360
I have the authority
to bring you and your team in.

515
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,454
Which arm?

516
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,325
The Global Treaty was negotiated

517
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,372
between Director Hunter
and the United Nations.

518
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,794
No, I mean, if you try to bring me
into the Bureau, I'll break your arm.

519
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,872
It's up to you. Right or left?

520
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,750
Your threats may work
on Confederate zombies,

521
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,524
Quentin Turnbull's cronies,
and Speedsters,

522
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,635
but you don't scare me.

523
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,658
I've spent the last five years
watching your screw-ups.

524
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,742
I know everything about you.

525
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,679
Now where is the member of my team
that you've taken hostage?

526
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,930
You mean Gary?

527
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,688
This ship is probably like a vacation
after having to answer to you.

528
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,021
Last chance.

529
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,797
Come quietly and I'll make sure

530
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,904
you get your job back
at Sink Shower & Stuff.

531
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,442
When did a Legend ever go quietly?

532
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,909
What are you looking at?

533
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,120
- Clowns.
- Get a grip, man.

534
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,290
We're already down
four members of our team.

535
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,126
Ladies and gentlemen,

536
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:46,506
welcome to the greatest show
on the planet!

537
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,308
My roving Museum of Freaks
and Hypnotic Hippodrome

538
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,567
has traveled this great nation

539
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,780
and I must say, I have never seen
quite a good-looking,

540
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,028
and dare I say, astute audience

541
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,610
as the one gathered
before me here today.

542
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,989
But a word of warning
before we begin.

543
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,372
For the jaw-dropping spectacle
that you are about to see

544
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,874
is not for the faint of heart.

545
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,043
May I now present you

546
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:24,260
Yin and Yang, the Wondrous
and world-renowned Siamese twins.

547
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,092
Oh, my God.

548
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,519
A miracle of biblical proportions.

549
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,513
<i>One mother, two fathers.</i>

550
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,811
I'm not judging.

551
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,194
Both sons capable of amazing

552
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,694
strength, intelligence
and coordination.

553
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,449
So juggle.

554
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,288
We need to create a diversion
so we can get past those thugs

555
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,797
and merge with Jefferson.

556
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,420
You're on your own, Professor.

557
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,005
- Clowns!
- Don't leave...

558
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,965
Now, what?

559
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,863
So, are you ready for your debut?

560
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,110
Kiss my ass.

561
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,316
I don't have time

562
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:32,241
to convince you of the creative joys
and lucrative appeal

563
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,205
of being my showstopper.

564
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,161
Those hayseeds out there
are gonna burn my circus down

565
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,995
if we don't give them
their money's worth.

566
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,210
Let me make it very simple for you.

567
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,963
Become the man of steel...

568
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,465
That is very catchy,
make a note of that.

569
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,388
Or get shot!

570
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,012
I don't respond well to threats.

571
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,559
- Nathaniel.
<i>- No.</i>

572
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,062
I'm not one of your freaks.

573
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,731
Would you steel up for her?

574
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,609
Fine, I'll do it.

575
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,977
Rip should have recruited you
to the Time Bureau.

576
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,458
Rip knows I'd never leave the team.

577
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,002
Your mistake.

578
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,713
You want to take a break?

579
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,053
- I could use some water.
- Yeah.

580
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,562
- Hope that thing's potty trained.
- Probably not.

581
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,687
- Cats are jerks.
- Let me guess, you're a dog person?

582
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,737
I like 'em dumb and loyal.

583
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,781
Speaking of,
we should probably check on Gary.

584
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,036
Whatever you do,

585
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,459
don't...

586
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,213
Run.

587
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,078
Where did you get a Time Courier?

588
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,434
Would someone mind untying me?

589
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,011
That is stolen government property.

590
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,188
It's just that I have
really bad circulation.

591
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,108
You're just mad
because I saved your life again.

592
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,838
<i>Captain Lance,
I hate to interrupt,</i>

593
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,089
<i>but I thought you would like to know</i>

594
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,979
<i>that the anachronism
has reached a level 9.</i>

595
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,822
My team's on it.

596
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,451
And if they fail,

597
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,777
maybe Rip will finally give up
on the ridiculous belief

598
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,453
that your team
could actually defeat...

599
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,492
You know what, he's going to take
your ship away, Ms. Lance.

600
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,125
Again.

601
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,710
Oh, no...

602
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,560
Son of a gun, it worked.

603
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,813
You really are quite marvelous!

604
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,941
No more...

605
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,206
No more...

606
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,698
Come on, one more.

607
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,673
Take care of that.

608
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Gordie!

609
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,772
Hey!

610
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,451
Die, clown!

611
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,678
Sir Rory...

612
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,629
A little help here.

613
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,065
Balloon animals, Grey, really?

614
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,395
The applause
might have gone to my head.

615
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,909
This is amazing!

616
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,624
Guys, Amaya looks like
she's gonna kill him!

617
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,338
Wow.

618
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,903
Stop her, Jefferson.

619
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,007
Amaya, no! Amaya, no! No, no, no.

620
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,343
Hey, no, no. Hey.

621
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,144
You can fight whatever this is.

622
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,559
You're Amaya Jiwe.

623
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,020
You're a member of
the Justice Society of America.

624
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,443
You're the most
courageous person I know.

625
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:24,120
That totem makes you a protector,
not a killer.

626
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,749
Amaya...

627
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,579
Come back to me.

628
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,047
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

629
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,296
- Nate?
- I'm right here.

630
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,216
I'm right here. I got you.

631
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,429
And that's our grand finale, folks.

632
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,231
I told you
it wasn't for the faint of heart!

633
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,646
We had it all.

634
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,443
We had action.

635
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,737
We have romance.

636
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,736
We had flaming things in the sky.

637
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,618
You wait until next week's show.

638
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,435
Well, Mr. Sneezums is now
a more manageable size.

639
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,137
- Mister Sneezums?
- Yeah, you like it?

640
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,017
The most important thing is

641
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:36,476
we put on one hell of a show
and Grey now loves the circus.

642
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,373
- I don't believe you.
<i>- Oh, it's true.</i>

643
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,070
He now thinks
that without the circus,

644
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,489
the world has lost one of its last
true places of wonder.

645
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,572
I mean, I don't believe that
the anachronism has been dealt with.

646
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,119
<i>Believe it, Agent Sharpe.</i>

647
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,492
<i>As I've already communicated
to Director Bennett,</i>

648
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,199
<i>1870, Wisconsin is anachronism-free.</i>

649
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,535
Ah. Even our A.I. doesn't like you.

650
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,913
Yup, my foot is definitely asleep.

651
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,292
- Gary...
<i>- And my leg.</i>

652
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,758
Could be permanent.

653
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,177
- Oh. Who's this guy?
- That's Gary. Can you give him a hand?

654
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,838
I need to speak with you in private.

655
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,646
Your sister, I presume.

656
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,644
And our friend, Oliver.

657
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,482
So...

658
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,484
I suppose
congratulations are in order.

659
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,614
You get to keep your ship
for now, but...

660
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,738
You will be watching us. Yes, yes.

661
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,945
I've heard this before.
So why don't you cut the crap

662
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,620
and tell me what we're facing here?

663
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,059
I don't know
what you're talking about.

664
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,293
You said that, "Rip will finally
give up his ridiculous belief

665
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,961
"that your team could actually..."

666
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,998
And then you stopped yourself.
So let's have it.

667
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,467
Who are we facing?

668
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,169
That information is need-to-know.

669
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,470
And all you need to know

670
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,424
is that you and your ridiculous team
could never handle it.

671
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,894
Aren't you forgetting something?

672
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,727
Gary.

673
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,818
Hey.

674
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,945
Do you want to talk about
what happened back there?

675
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,527
Not especially...

676
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,657
Look, it might help.

677
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,494
I'm glad you and I talked,
about why you left me.

678
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,664
- It made me feel better.
- It d id?

679
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,079
A little.

680
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,542
In that case, I think the whole
team deserves to hear this.

681
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,756
It started a month ago.

682
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:38,185
Whenever I would tap into my powers,
I could feel myself losing control,

683
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,313
as if the animal was in charge,
not me.

684
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,361
One day, Belgian soldiers
came to my village.

685
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,899
I told them
Zambesi was under my protection.

686
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,319
And when they attacked...
I killed them all.

687
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,162
It sounds like
you didn't have a choice.

688
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,993
No, you don't understand.

689
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,950
These soldiers were just boys...

690
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,753
When they tried to run,
I hunted them down,

691
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,709
one by one by one,
and I ripped them to shreds.

692
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,761
That's the real reason you came back.

693
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,432
I needed a place to think.

694
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,764
This totem is my birthright
and my sacred duty.

695
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,733
But something is terribly wrong.

696
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,443
What if I lose control
over my village?

697
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,775
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

698
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,440
I wanted to tell you,

699
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:33,115
all of you. But I was too ashamed.

700
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,491
Well, we've all done things
we're not proud of.

701
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,120
Except Haircut.

702
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,126
Well, no, actually...

703
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,295
I'm actually really bad
at returning library books.

704
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,299
I can't go home.

705
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,212
Not yet. But I'm not sure
that I can stay here either.

706
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,639
You saw me earlier.
You could all be in danger.

707
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,053
You are one of us.

708
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,769
- Maybe now more than ever.
- We'd be crazy to let you go.

709
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,477
Besides, we're really going
to need your help now.

710
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,528
We got a new problem.

711
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,361
Rip has been hiding
something from us.

712
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,696
There's a greater evil coming.

713
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,992
Something even the Time Bureau
is afraid of.

714
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,716
What can be worse than an
immortal Egyptian Demigod?

715
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,919
Or an evil speedster.

716
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,592
Oh, I'm afraid of the time boogeyman...

717
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,091
I'm literally crying.

718
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,205
Welcome back, Kuasa.

719
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,755
Who are you?

720
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,960
A follower of Mallus.

721
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,502
And we have work to do.
