1
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,729
Looks like that Munson boy's
up to no good again.

2
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,988
Mr. Munson.

3
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,074
Where is she?

4
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,325
I just found her there.

5
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,870
I swear, I don't even know her name.
I never seen her 'fore.

6
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,122
Just calm down and stay back.

7
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,213
What you boys doing?

8
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,099
Holy mother of God.

9
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,983
Hey!

10
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,609
You can't be out here.
Get back inside.

11
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,653
Back inside.

12
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,674
Hey, Frank. Chief Powell here.

13
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,218
Listen…

14
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,931
We caught a body
over here at the Munsons' trailer.

15
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>I don't even know how to describe it.</i>

16
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

17
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>Uh, look…</i>

18
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,775
<i>…I need you down here ASAP</i>

19
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,945
<i>to tell me what the hell I'm looking at,</i>

20
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>or how someone
could even do something like this.</i>

21
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,711
<i>Flight 623 just landed from Indianapolis</i>

22
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>and will be arriving at gate two.</i>

23
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>Flight 623 from Indianapolis at gate two.</i>

24
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,807
Mike.

25
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,893
Ah!

26
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,816
Oh, careful, careful, careful.
You're squishing your present.

27
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,234
It's a gift.

28
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,821
I, uh... I handpicked those
for you in Hawkins.

29
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,617
I know you like yellow, but now
I'm realizing it's too much yellow.

30
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,078
I know you also like purple,
so I got purple as well.

31
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,747
So I kinda did, like,
a 70/30 split kinda thing.

32
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,874
- They're perfect. Thank you.
- Oh. Oh!

33
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,626
Hey. How you doing?

34
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,796
- Hey, Mike.
- How you doing?

35
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,797
Yeah, good, man.

36
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
Great. Uh, what's that?

37
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,636
Um, it's nothing.
Just this painting I've been working on.

38
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,804
Cool.

39
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,182
That's a rad shirt, man.

40
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,225
Ocean Pacific?

41
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,727
Oh, hey, Mike.
This is, uh, my friend Argyle.

42
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,187
Oh. Hey.

43
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,941
Oh no, no, no.

44
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,777
No, it's a shitty knockoff. Yeah.

45
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,947
But don't sweat it.
I'll get you the good threads out here.

46
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,242
I heard a lot about your sister.

47
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,327
Uh.

48
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,456
O-Okay. Um, should we go?

49
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man.

50
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,335
Yeah, so awkward.

51
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,463
I really thought it was Ocean Pacific.

52
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,465
I have our whole day planned.

53
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,135
First, El Rodeo for burritos.

54
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,387
What, really? Burritos for breakfast?

55
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,555
Yes. Trust me.

56
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,474
Yeah, no, I… I trust you.
It's just, you know, a little weird.

57
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,102
Then, after burritos,
I want to go to Rink-O-Mania.

58
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,354
Rink-O-Mania, okay.
What's Rink-O-Mania?

59
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,356
It's the most fun place in Lenora.

60
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,191
They have skating and games.

61
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,527
Sounds awesome.
Are your friends gonna meet us?

62
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,237
Friends? What… What friends?

63
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,738
You know, Stacy and Angela.

64
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,450
- Angela?
- You'll meet them, I promise.

65
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,078
Just not today.
I want today to be about me and you.

66
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,592
- Where to?
- 4819 Lonzo Way.

67
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,137
Let's go. This is life or death.
Snap, snap!

68
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,263
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,442
Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't
like a cheap, fake laugh either.

70
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,361
It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.

71
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,780
Of course.
It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.

72
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,576
My point is that Vicki laughed
and everything was just like…

73
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,328
- It was perfect.
- But?

74
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,915
But I'm having this problem
where it's like, I should stop talking.

75
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,209
I have said everything I need to say.

76
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,587
But then I guess I get nervous,
and the words keep spilling out,

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,089
and it's like my… my brain
is moving faster than my mouth,

78
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
or… or rather my… my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm digging this hole for myself,

80
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,513
and I want to stop digging,
I'm trying to stop, but I can't.

81
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,598
And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?

82
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,225
Yeah, you are.

83
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,853
Oh, I'm hopeless.

84
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,396
Eh.

85
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,315
We both are.

86
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,569
If only we could just, like, combine.

87
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
Combine?

88
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,573
No, think about it.

89
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,452
I know exactly what I want,
and I've found the girl of my dreams,

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,579
but I can't get the courage
to ask her out.

91
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,582
- Mm.
- Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.

92
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,168
- And you have no idea what you want.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,005
So if we just combined,
all our problems would be solved.

94
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,591
Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…

95
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,842
We totally suck.

96
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
Totally and utterly.

97
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,763
Ooh, I think
I found our morning movie.

98
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,433
<i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

99
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,811
Ugh, you know I don't do double VHS.

100
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,312
But it's about doomed love.

101
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
- Oh, well, that's relatable.
- Precisely.

102
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,735
Also, Julie Christie
is b-b-bonkers hot in this.

103
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,405
Like, seriously,
the most beautiful creature

104
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,781
I have seen in my life.

105
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,951
<i>We're in the Forest Hills
trailer park in east Roane County.</i>

106
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,745
<i>We don't have a lot of details now,
but we can confirm</i>

107
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,082
<i>that the body of a Hawkins High student
was discovered early this morning.</i>

108
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,501
<i>- Police have not released the name…</i>
- Holy shit.

109
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,130
<i>…although we are told they're currently
in the process of notifying the family.</i>

110
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,018
You all right in there, Sinclair?

111
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,519
I'm good.

112
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,356
First hangover feels like
you're gonna split in two,

113
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,649
but you'll live.

114
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>…occurred here is sure to touch
a nerve across the community of Hawkins,</i>

115
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>which is still reeling
from last year's devastating mall fire.</i>

116
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Over 30 innocent…</i>

117
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>…completely blocked off at…</i>

118
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,795
Come on.

119
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,715
Just hit it, man.

120
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,383
- Yo, just hit it.
- Yeah.

121
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>But whatever has occurred…</i>

122
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,929
- Piece of shit.
- There you go. See?

123
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,349
<i>…Is newly appointed police chief
Calvin Powell,</i>

124
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
<i>who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.</i>

125
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,395
What's this?
I thought we were watching <i>ThunderCats.</i>

126
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,439
Hawkins student got murdered.

127
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,357
What?

128
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Yeah, it's on every channel.

129
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,321
<i>As you can see behind me, Chief Powell
and the Hawkins Police Department</i>

130
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>are actively investigating the scene…</i>

131
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,200
They say who it is?

132
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
No, not yet.

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,412
Hey, maybe Chrissy
didn't stand you up after all.

134
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,164
Hey, don't say that.

135
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,083
Relax, it was a joke.

136
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,087
A joke? Come on, someone just died
and you're making a joke out of it?

137
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
It was at the trailer park,

138
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,174
so probably some druggy
OD'd on heroin or some shit.

139
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,259
Oh, see, that makes it funnier.

140
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,137
What is up your ass this morning?
It was a joke.

141
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>We also don't yet know
if foul play was involved.</i>

142
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,446
<i>But whatever has occurred here</i>

143
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,116
<i>is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins.</i>

144
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,160
<i>Ever since that girl, Barb,
died a few years ago,</i>

145
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,788
<i>it has been one thing after another.</i>

146
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>I'll tell ya, you start to believe
all those things they say,</i>

147
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,627
<i>that this town is cursed,</i>

148
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>that the devil lives here in Hawkins.</i>

149
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,297
Nancy!

150
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,469
I don't think anyone's gonna
care about the basketball game anymore.

151
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Nancy?

152
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
- Earth to Nancy.
- What?

153
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,683
I said I don't think anyone's
gonna care about the game.

154
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,560
Yeah. No, I know.

155
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,063
Would you be up for a field trip?

156
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,295
Many of the residents
we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us.

157
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,340
Grief, shock, disbelief, anger.

158
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,384
Everyone wants to know the same thing,

159
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,846
how can so many tragedies
befall a once-peaceful town?

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,683
All eyes are now
on the police for answers.

161
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,061
Is the new chief of police, Powell,
in over his head?

162
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,522
Or is he the very savior this town needs?

163
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,358
<i>We'll be here the rest of the day
right here on channel nine,</i>

164
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,361
<i>where we'll keep you posted
on all the latest developments.</i>

165
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,908
<i>In the meantime, we recommend you
keep your doors and windows locked tight.</i>

166
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
<i>This is Beverly Moss, signing off for…</i>

167
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,330
My heart can't take it anymore.
It just can't take it.

168
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,131
<i>Chrissy Cunningham?</i>

169
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,466
You're sure it was Chrissy?

170
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,512
Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing
she was in when I saw her with Eddie.

171
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,680
- Did you tell all this to the cops?
- No.

172
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,266
No, but I… I can't be the only one
who saw them together.

173
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,476
They stood out.

174
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,395
Eddie the freak
with Chrissy the cheerleader?

175
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,690
Exactly. You know, his name's not
in the news yet or anything,

176
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,151
but I guarantee you
Eddie is suspect one now.

177
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,694
That's crazy.

178
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,655
Eddie didn't do this. No way.

179
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,615
No way.

180
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,492
- We can't rule it out.
- Yes, we can.

181
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,744
- Dustin!
- You don't know him like I do, Max.

182
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,037
Okay?

183
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,541
When we got to high school,
Lucas made all his sports friends.

184
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,583
Mike and me?

185
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,253
I mean, no one was nice to us.

186
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,296
No one except Eddie.

187
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,758
Okay. Well, they said
the same shit about Ted Bundy.

188
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,510
Yeah, he's a super nice guy,

189
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,346
but then he's murdering women
on the weekend.

190
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,015
So you're saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy?

191
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,061
No, I'm not saying... I'm saying
that we can't presume anything, okay?

192
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,896
But it doesn't look good for Eddie.

193
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,779
Why haven't you told the cops this?

194
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,531
I… I don't know.

195
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,659
You don't know?

196
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,170
After I saw Eddie and Chrissy
go in the trailer…

197
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,674
…something else happened.

198
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,511
Okay, all right. Last one.

199
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,484
Come on.

200
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>Nothing that weird
or anything. I mean…</i>

201
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,937
Eddie always drives like a maniac,

202
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,899
and the power goes off at my place
all the time. It's a piece of shit. But…

203
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,529
This morning,
I started to think back, and…

204
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,950
I don't know.

205
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,952
The look on his face.

206
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,206
He was scared, Dustin.

207
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,708
Really scared.

208
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,294
Maybe he was scared because,

209
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,631
you know, he…
he just killed someone, or…

210
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
Maybe, um…

211
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,178
Maybe be... because…

212
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,263
I don't… I don't know, maybe…

213
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,934
Something else killed her.

214
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,525
But that's impossible.

215
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,151
Right?

216
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,612
I don't know.

217
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,865
It should be.

218
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,204
Only one person knows
what actually happened.

219
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,667
Eddie.

220
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,585
- Have you talked to anyone else?
- No.

221
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,046
I can't find Lucas or Nancy,
and Mike's in...

222
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,881
California. Shit, shit, shit.

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,550
- Where you going?
- To see a friend.

224
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,970
- You heard the news. It's not safe.
- We'll be careful. Thanks. Love you. Bye.

225
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,941
<i>"Hop is alive."</i>

226
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,444
"He looks ford to date."

227
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,904
"Pleeze to make resarvazion,

228
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,492
call seven-four-one-five-two,"
blah, blah.

229
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,746
"Open 12 day P.E.T.T."

230
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,581
"No government, please."

231
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,833
"Kind regards, Enzo."

232
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,128
I like it even less in person.

233
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,255
What do you mean, "Like it less"?

234
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,506
I don't trust it.

235
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,675
For starters, who the hell sent this?

236
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,718
A friend?

237
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,303
- A friend?
- Of Hop's?

238
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,889
"Hop is alive. No government"?

239
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,476
This looks and reads like a ransom note,
and a bad one at that.

240
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,103
- There's no proof of life here.
- Yes, there is.

241
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,939
It's signed "Enzo."

242
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,274
- So?
- So?

243
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,611
There's only two people
who knew about our date at Enzo's,

244
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,820
and that's me and Hop.

245
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
So, whoever wrote this,

246
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,867
Hop trusted enough
to make him sign it Enzo.

247
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,244
He's sending me a message.

248
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,502
You saw him die, Joyce.

249
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,177
I didn't see a body.

250
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,266
Because he evaporated.

251
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,518
Or…

252
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,645
He survived.

253
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,149
Okay. Okay.

254
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,570
Let's indulge this fantasy for a moment.

255
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,239
He's Houdini.

256
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,200
He's a cat man with nine lives.

257
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,285
Whatever it is, he survives.

258
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,372
What's he doing in Russia?
He was captured, that's what.

259
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,749
Then he probably met some new friends.

260
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,377
And by friends, I mean the KGB.

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,048
And believe me when I tell you,
these people are the worst of the worst.

262
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,009
I am talking torture, Joyce.

263
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,346
And no matter how strong you think Jim is,

264
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,472
they will break him.

265
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,891
They will get his whole life story.

266
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,938
And yes, that might very well include
a planned date at Enzo's with you,

267
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,273
his co-conspirator,

268
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,277
making this all an elaborate ruse
to capture you as well.

269
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
You just made all that up.

270
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,619
It's a theory.

271
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,663
I prefer mine.

272
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,747
So do I.

273
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,417
Doesn't make it right.

274
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,710
Well, either way,

275
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,921
this could be real.

276
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,633
Hopper could be alive.

277
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,053
I suppose there's
only one way to find out.

278
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,556
What are you doing?

279
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,266
We're gonna call that number

280
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,935
and you're going to find out

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
who the hell sent you that letter.

282
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,441
But we're doing it… my way.

283
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,307
Where do you think you're going?

284
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,573
Tell me, who you work with?

285
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,243
I told you,

286
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,911
no one.

287
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,710
This woman,

288
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796
who is she?

289
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,506
Why don't you tell me?

290
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,425
She's wearing a Russian uniform.

291
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,097
Get the Elephant.

292
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,122
You want to die
for this woman, American?

293
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,264
Hey, Will.

294
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,683
We'll be back at 6:00.

295
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,018
Have fun, okay?

296
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,103
Okay.

- Have fun.
- Thanks.

- Yeah, bitchin'. Do you come here a lot?

- Will does not, but I go to parties here.
- No...

307
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,522
It's a big party place.

308
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,445
Oh, I forgot. You need socks.

Oh, shit.

- They… They sell them at the counter.
- Oh, okay.

311
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,037
How'd you forget about the socks?

312
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,206
I mean, since you come here all the time.

313
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,583
I… I don't know. I just forgot.

314
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,168
Right.

315
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,546
Why do you keep lying?

316
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,007
- What?
- Why do you keep lying to Mike?

317
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,510
- I'm not lying.
- You're not?

318
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,847
You're friends with Angela and Stacy
and you come to parties here?

319
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,890
- I have been to a party here.
- For Mom's work.

320
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,434
That's not what you implied.

321
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,855
I just… I don't think Mike's gonna like
that you're lying to him.

322
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,941
And he doesn't deserve that.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

323
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,780
Okay, so, I asked for vomit green
and I got vomit green.

324
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,990
Isn't that awesome?

325
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,259
I'm so bad at this, I'm like Bambi on ice.

326
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,678
No, you're good. You got this.

327
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,762
Okay.

328
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,448
That's what it's all about, right?

329
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,249
Oh my God, guys.

330
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:02,959
Check it out.

331
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,838
Who's that twig with her?

332
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,215
I don't know.

333
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,594
But it seems like
the snitch has a boyfriend.

334
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,138
Told you spring break's gonna be fun.

335
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,766
<i>♪ Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus ♪</i>

336
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,309
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, Amadeus ♪</i>

337
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,690
All right, let me check.

338
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,154
Hey.

339
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
I'm sure it's nothing, all right?

340
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,285
Probably the neighbors complained
about the noise or some shit.

341
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,746
You all right?

342
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,082
Yeah.

343
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm good.

344
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,087
All right.

345
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,844
And you were here all night?

346
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,762
Yes.

347
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,222
Ask anyone.

348
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh, we will,
but thank you for the suggestion.

349
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,435
I see a whole lot of beer around.

350
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,022
- You have fun last night?
- What, you gonna arrest me for drinking?

351
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,483
It is against the law, so we could.

352
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,442
Should we?

353
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,028
I'd vote for trespassing, myself.

354
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,406
I don't think Benny's family
would be too thrilled

355
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,199
to see what you've done to his place.

356
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,618
Yo, people been using this shithole
for years, man.

357
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,078
Act like you guys didn't know.

358
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,538
What about your girlfriend?

359
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,540
She party here last night?

360
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,333
Chrissy?

361
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,127
No.

362
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,213
That's odd, what with her
being your girlfriend and all.

363
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,216
- Why you asking about Chris?
- When's the last time you talked to her?

364
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,384
After the game.

365
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,640
Look, this… this doesn't have to do with
that dead student, does it?

366
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,310
What did Chrissy say
when you talked to her?

367
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,227
Well, sh-she…

368
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,315
I mean, said she was gonna go home,
get changed, something like that.

369
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,984
Did she mention anything
about buying drugs for the party?

370
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,071
Drugs? No. No way.
Chrissy doesn't mess with that crap.

371
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,867
- Maybe someone talked her into it.
- No. She's straight as an arrow.

372
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,201
What about Eddie Munson?

373
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,495
Ever seen her talking to him?

374
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,830
That freak?

375
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,998
No.

376
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,207
No way.

377
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,047
Wait, what…

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,549
What does Eddie have to do with all this?

379
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,178
Did that freak hurt her?

380
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,639
He hurt Chrissy?

381
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,684
Did he hurt Chrissy?

382
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,778
Jason. Hey, man, you all right?

383
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,945
Jason, what happened?

384
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,782
Where are you going?
Is everything good?

385
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,200
What did they say?

386
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,993
Are they gonna call our parents?

387
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,703
Jason!

388
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,776
Hey, Steve.

389
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,028
- You see this?
- How many phones do you have?

390
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,031
- Someone was murdered.
- How many phones do you have?

391
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,826
- Two. Why?
- Technically three, if you count Keith's.

392
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,244
Yeah, three works.

393
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,121
What are you doing?

394
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,831
- What are you...
- My pile!

395
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,917
No, no, no! My tapes! Dude.

396
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,293
What are you doing, man?

397
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,213
- Setting up base of operations here.
- Base of operations?

398
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,756
- Get off.
- I need it.

399
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,883
- For what?
- Eddie's friends' phone numbers.

400
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,095
Your new best friend you think is cooler
because he plays your nerdy game?

401
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes. I never said that.

402
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:48,059
Seriously, you guys, maybe on a Monday
you can play around, but it's Saturday.

403
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,394
It's our busiest day.

404
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,647
- Robin, I empathize, but this cannot wait.
- Oh my God.

405
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,774
Calling Eddie's friends is an emergency?

406
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,444
- Correct!
- Want me to strangle him or you want to?

407
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,611
We could take turns.

408
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,948
- Can you fill them in while I do this?
- Fill us in on what?

409
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,914
What's our game plan?

410
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,082
Game plan?

411
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,041
Yeah.

412
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,962
When you and Jonathan investigated
for <i>Hawkins Post,</i> did you split up or…?

413
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,757
Well, first of all, you're not Jonathan.

414
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,216
Clearly not.

415
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,552
I'm here, present and accounted for.

416
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,305
I've gone through
a lot of managing editors. Okay?

417
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,265
Ooh, somebody's testy.

418
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,516
Curious.

419
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,437
I'm annoyed he's not here.
Okay? Is that what you wanna hear?

420
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,522
And yeah, something's going on with him.

421
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,983
But that's not the mystery
we're investigating today.

422
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,109
A student died.

423
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,863
The game plan is for you to let me
do the talking, for you to take notes,

424
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,865
and for you to follow my lead
at all times.

425
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,908
Is that understood?

426
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,409
Totally and completely.

427
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,954
Shit. Slow down, slow down.

428
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,499
Just act casual.

429
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,542
And follow your lead.

430
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,960
Got it.

431
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,803
- Hi, officer.
- Can't get through. Got a crime scene.

432
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,430
Yeah, um, I... I was just going to…

433
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,557
Um…

434
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
See Max Mayfield, a friend.

435
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,936
She lives in there.

436
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,979
We're restricting access
to residents only.

437
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,105
It's just, um,

438
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
her mom is working today

439
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,069
and we would really
like to check in on her.

440
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,280
We're basically her nanny. Nannies.

441
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,785
Don't I know you?

442
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,328
I don't think so.

443
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,287
Yeah.

444
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,040
Actually, I do know you.

445
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,750
You're Fred Benson.

446
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,253
You killed that kid last year.

447
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,046
What?

448
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,966
That ugly scar on your face.

449
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,052
It's from that crash.

450
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,848
It… It was an accident.

451
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,641
An accident?

452
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,229
Is that why you ran all the way home
instead of calling us?

453
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,232
You're a murderer is what you are.

454
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,109
Everyone here knows it.

455
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,154
A murderer. A murderer. A murderer.

456
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,992
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer.

457
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,619
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer!

458
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,746
- You all right there?
- What?

459
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,166
I said, you all right, kid?
You're looking a little peaked.

460
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,128
Fine.

461
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,045
I'm fine.

462
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,381
He's just, um, on edge.

463
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,966
I mean, we all are.

464
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,637
I'll let you check on your friend,
but be fast. Yeah?

465
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,764
Of course, officer. Thank you.

466
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
Okay, what was that?

467
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,900
I said act casual.

468
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,193
Yeah, it's just…

469
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,696
Sorry.

470
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,702
Yes!

471
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,459
I don't know.

472
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,544
Part of me expected her
to be on that plane.

473
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,504
Or something.

474
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,716
Just like, "Hey, surprise!"

475
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,801
"Here I am."

476
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,596
- But also…
- Shit!

477
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,056
…I felt this…

478
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,141
I felt this intense relief

479
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,768
when she wasn't there.

480
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,104
No, that's the Purple Palm Tree Delight
working its magic, my man.

481
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,564
Makes your troubles float away

482
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,150
like the seed pods of a dandelion
flowing in the wind.

483
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,234
No.

484
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,112
No, that's not it.

485
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,530
Hey…

486
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,241
If I show you something,

487
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,535
you wouldn't tell anyone, right?

488
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,163
Who would I tell? You're my only friend,
Jonathan.

489
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,297
Yes.

490
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,760
What's that?

491
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,098
It's an acceptance letter
to Lenora Community.

492
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,933
- That's where I'm going.
- I know.

493
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,769
But you're going to Emerson with Nancy.

494
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,312
No, I'm not.

495
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,690
She just doesn't know it yet.

496
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,108
Hold on, what is going on?

497
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,736
Like, I… I can't leave
my mom and my brother

498
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,364
to… to… to chase
a dream that isn't mine.

499
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,908
You're dead, man. You are so dead.

500
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,368
What was I supposed to do?

501
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
- Not lie.
- Not lie?

502
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,037
- Yeah.
- Not lie?

503
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,248
- Yeah!
- What, so I just tell her the truth?

504
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,958
- Yes.
- No. No.

505
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,335
Because… Because if I told her the truth,

506
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,171
then she'd just
throw her dreams out the window

507
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,800
to come out here and be with me.
And I… I just can't take that.

508
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,926
Like, you know?

509
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,096
Like, this… this huge knot
of resentment would build,

510
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,473
like… like some cancer,

511
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,560
until eventually she hates me.

512
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,771
And then, before you know it,
we're just like my mom and dad.

513
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,274
- We're divorced, my kids hate me.
- Shit!

514
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,901
Yeah, shit! I mean, it's all shit.

515
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,071
The cycle never ends.

516
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,115
Yeah, man. Your nightmare cycle.

517
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,826
You want it to stop,
but what is your approach here?

518
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,370
To just slow-motion break up with Nancy?

519
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,457
- I guess.
- No, man!

520
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,375
I know. I don't know what to do.

521
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,210
Palm Tree Delight! That's what you do.

522
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,837
- Palm Tree Delight?
- Go, go. Go.

523
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,838
<i>Ándale, ándale.</i>

524
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,549
- Really? Okay.
<i>- Ándale. Arriba, arriba.</i> Let's go!

525
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,217
Backpack in the back of the van.

526
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,177
Go!

527
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,391
Got me stressed out.
It's not even my girlfriend.

528
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,408
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

529
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,618
Yup, mine's better.

530
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,577
No, it isn't.

531
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,912
Milkshakes?

532
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,705
Yum.

533
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,584
Where, oh where have you
been hiding this handsome thing?

534
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:48,920
Uh,

535
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,882
Angela, thi… this is Mike,

536
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,050
my boyfriend.

537
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,886
Angela. Pleasure.

538
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,012
Heard a lot about you.

539
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,890
It's really cool to finally meet
some of El... Jane's friends.

540
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,100
Friends?

541
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,309
Yeah.

542
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,602
Super cool.

543
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,270
Come on, friend.

544
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,814
Let's skate, shall we?

545
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,650
- I wanted to finish...
- I'll hold that.

546
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,527
Come on.

547
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
Whoo!

548
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,371
Why are you so nervous?

549
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,873
We're just having fun.

550
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,302
- Oh no.
- What?

551
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,430
El, she hasn't been
telling you everything.

552
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,432
- What you talking about?
- She's lying to you.

553
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,143
- Bullshit.
- No, listen to me.

554
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,938
- She's having problems here.
- Problems. Okay, what kind of problems?

555
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,901
Stay put.

556
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
All right, everyone.

557
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,493
This next song is dedicated to Jane,

558
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,620
the local snitch.

559
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,169
<i>♪ Wipe out… ♪</i>

560
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
Freak! Go home!

561
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,093
Loser!

562
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,654
- She's a little baby!
- Baby!

563
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,290
Gonna cry to Mommy?

564
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,167
Hey!

565
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,377
Hey, hey, turn it off.

566
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,379
Sorry. I can't hear you, dude.

567
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,678
Crybaby!

568
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,097
I said turn it off.

569
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,682
If you say so.

570
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,899
Wipeout.

571
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,319
Oh!

572
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,459
Didn't you see the sign, dummy?

573
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,045
"No food or drinks on the rink."

574
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,925
El! El!

575
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,009
El!

576
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,141
So sad!

577
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,771
El!

578
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,567
Stop. No.

579
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,362
Hey, get out of my way! El!

580
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,118
El!

581
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,555
Murray, we gotta make this call.

582
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,056
One moment, please.

583
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,895
Voilà.

584
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,065
Okay, you are now calling
from Durham, North Carolina.

585
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,486
But if this is KGB, they will still
be able to trace us eventually,

586
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,280
so keep it brief.

587
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,281
How brief?

588
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,782
A minute, max, and…

589
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,118
Proof of life. Got it.

590
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:50,953
Okay.

591
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,752
One, two…

592
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,359
This is Enzo.

593
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,943
Hello, Enzo?

594
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,278
This is Joyce.

595
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,572
I received your message,

596
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,201
<i>- and I would like to make a reservation.</i>
- Yes, good, good.

597
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,578
<i>But for reservation,
you need to make deposit.</i>

598
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,997
Uh, what… what kind of deposit?

599
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,457
Forty thousand dollars.

600
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,211
You have it in Hopper's trust,
for the girl, yes?

601
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,505
Uh, yes. Yes. Forty thousand.

602
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,422
<i>Good.</i>

603
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,467
Bring to Yuri's Fish n' Fly
in Nome, Alaska.

604
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,552
Uh, you want me to go to Alaska?

605
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,678
<i>Yes.</i>

606
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,972
You give Yuri money, Yuri gets me money,

607
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,224
I give him your friend.

608
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,518
<i>Simple trade, understand?</i>

609
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,395
Uh…

610
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,982
…uh, first, we… we're gonna
have to speak to Hopper.

611
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,609
We need to know he's alive.

612
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,902
Hey!

613
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,242
I'm afraid not possible.

614
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,368
Why not?

615
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,162
Your friend is, uh, stuck.

616
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,873
<i>But you give me money, I make him unstuck.</i>

617
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,291
<i>You must trust me.</i>

618
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,294
How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.

619
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,178
Forty thousand. Yuri's
Fish n' Fly. Two days. Do not call again.

620
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,311
Well, that wasn't the KGB.

621
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,230
But it wasn't a friend either.

622
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,065
So we're both wrong.

623
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,819
Who the hell was that?

624
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,918
Still alive.

625
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,172
But he is barely breathing.

626
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,010
More of this, he will die.

627
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,349
You are strong, American.

628
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,563
Perhaps the Motherland
could use that strength.

629
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,901
Send him to Kamchatka!

630
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,620
I never knew you to be generous.

631
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,749
You clearly do not know Kamchatka, Doctor.

632
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,295
This man does not deserve
the peace of death.

633
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,840
So I have sent him...

634
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,384
to Hell.

635
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,797
Present arms.

636
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,425
Lieutenant Colonel, welcome to Indiana.

637
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,972
Eddie Munson.

638
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,391
He's a part of
that freak devil cult, Hellfire.

639
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,394
<i>The cops, they say
Chrissy went to him to buy drugs.</i>

640
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,687
Drugs? No.

641
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,897
That's what I said.
Chrissy would never touch that shit.

642
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>They wouldn't even
show her parents her face.</i>

643
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,279
I don't know what this freak did
to Chrissy, but he did something sick.

644
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,864
Probably sacrificed her,
drained her blood for the devil.

645
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,951
- Satanists do that.
- That's what I'm saying. It's this cult.

646
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,329
Hellfire isn't a cult.

647
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,001
It's… It's just a D&D club.

648
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,379
D… D&D?

649
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,881
Dungeons & Dragons?

650
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,552
It's like a… It's like a game.
It… It's fantasy.

651
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,764
And how exactly is it
you know all of that, Sinclair?

652
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:22,891
Uh…

653
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,187
Well, it's my sister.

654
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,190
Yeah, she's like…
She's like, a total nerd.

655
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,525
- You know?
- Yeah.

656
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,278
Nerds? Like, she plays a lot sometimes...

657
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,780
I'm sure your sister
isn't killing people, right?

658
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,576
But I've read the wrong person
plays this game, it can warp their mind.

659
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,246
They confuse fantasy and reality,
and innocent people die.

660
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,082
Been happening all over the country.
It's an epidemic.

661
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,876
I've read about that shit. It's real.

662
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,044
And I think Eddie…

663
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,380
He's the wrong type of person, right?

664
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,799
You know, he got lost.

665
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,053
He thought Chrissy was
just a part of his… his sick game.

666
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,805
And chances are,
he's still in the game. Meaning...

667
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,057
He's gonna kill again.

668
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,852
But not if we can help it.

669
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,772
Would Chrissy want us to just stand by

670
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,733
while the cops go around
pursuing some bullshit leads,

671
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,361
spreading rumors saying she's some druggy?

672
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,237
- No!
- No, she'd want us to go out there.

673
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,657
- To do something about it, wouldn't she?
- Yeah!

674
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,450
- Then let's hunt some freak!
- Yeah!

675
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,951
- For Chrissy!
- Yeah!

676
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,953
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

677
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,457
<i>♪ I can't seem to face up to the facts ♪</i>

678
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,794
<i>♪ I'm tense and nervous
And I can't relax… ♪</i>

679
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,337
Let's go!

680
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,674
<i>♪ I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire ♪</i>

681
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:41,220
<i>♪ Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire… ♪</i>

682
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,430
Have you seen or heard
from Eddie recently?

683
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,640
Eddie Munson.

684
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,059
- When's the last time you talked to him?
- Seen him?

685
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,813
- Okay. Sorry to bother you.
- Know anyone who'd know where he is?

686
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,274
I really don't think he's at the arcade.
Yep, I'm pretty sure.

687
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,612
Reefer Rick? No. Does this Reefer Rick
have a last name? I mean, it's kind of…

688
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,031
All right, <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

689
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
It's a double VHS. It's long.

690
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,036
But that's because
it's filled with action and romance,

691
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,288
and a little bit of suspense.

692
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,583
So, my boyfriend won't, like,
totally puke when I bring it home?

693
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,335
Oh, you… your boyfriend?

694
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,004
Uh, no. No. He's gonna…

695
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,881
He's gonna love it.

696
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,799
Yeah.

697
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,219
- See ya.
- Yeah, see ya later.

698
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,304
Alligator.

699
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,433
Goddammit.

700
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,394
Hey, guys, I might have a lead.

701
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,438
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

702
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,274
Apparently, Eddie gets drugs
from some guy named Reefer Rick,

703
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,900
and sometimes Eddie crashes there.

704
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,278
Sounds promising.
Where does Reefer Rick live?

705
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,655
See, that's the thing. No one knows.

706
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,117
He's more of a… a legend
than someone that people actually know.

707
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,202
- Last name?
- I don't know that either.

708
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,912
Bet the cops know the last name.

709
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,372
- What?
- Cops.

710
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,836
I mean, listen, if this Reefer Rick
is actually a drug dealer,

711
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,547
I guarantee you
he's been busted at some point.

712
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,716
- Means he's in the system.
- The cops?

713
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,719
Really, Steve? That's your suggestion?

714
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,431
I think they should be filled in
on what we know, what's going on.

715
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,683
- You think Eddie's guilty, don't you?
- Whoa.

716
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,061
I believe in innocent until proven guilty,
all that constitutional shit.

717
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,271
I just, you know,

718
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,857
don't think we can rule it out.

719
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,860
That's precisely what
we're trying to do here, Steve.

720
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,654
And maybe we'd have a little bit more luck

721
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,199
if you spent less time
trying to find a girlfriend

722
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,284
and more time trying to find Eddie.

723
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,746
- Somebody has to attend to the customers.
- Especially if they're babes, right?

724
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,414
Hey, not fair. Okay?

725
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:36,168
I attend to all customers equally,
babes and non-babes alike.

726
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,339
We've got a very big selection in here.
It can be super overwhelming for people.

727
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,965
Yeah, it can be.

728
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,720
- What are you doing?
- Maybe we don't need a last name.

729
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,894
- Twelve Ricks have accounts here.
- Lot of Ricks.

730
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,271
So, let's narrow it down.

731
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,150
Rick Alderman's latest rentals
are <i>Annie </i>and <i>Dumbo.</i>

732
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,736
- Chances our drug dealer has a family?
- Not likely.

733
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,947
All right. Rick Conroy.

734
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,199
<i>Sixteen Candles,
Teen Wolf, Romancing the Stone.</i>

735
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,492
No.

736
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,788
Okay. Rick Joiner.
<i>Mask, Footloose,</i> and<i> Grease.</i>

737
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,039
Nah.

738
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,459
Rick Kimbrough.
<i>The Blue Lagoon </i>and <i>Splash.</i>

739
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
Definitely not.

740
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,671
- No way.
- Okay. Rick Lipton.

741
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,465
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Cheech & Chong's Next Movie.</i>

742
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,050
<i>Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams.</i>

743
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,594
<i>- Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke.</i>
- Bingo.

744
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,556
- Lipton?
- Spelled like the tea. 2121 Holland Road.

745
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,975
- That's out by Lovers Lake.
- Middle of nowhere.

746
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,518
It's a perfect place to hide.

747
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,243
Um, hi, I'm Nancy Wheeler
from the<i> Hawkins Tiger...</i>

748
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,245
I've talked to enough reporters. Yeah.

749
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,085
Okay, well…

750
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,754
What about that one? With the flag?

751
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,008
Yeah, I tried them twice.
They were actually quite rude.

752
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,759
I am not doing that again.

753
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,220
I'm telling you, we've talked to everyone.

754
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,472
Nope. Not everyone.

755
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,769
Hi there. Hi.
Did you see something last night, huh?

756
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,272
Oh, you wanna tell us everything?

757
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,024
Nancy, come on. Let's get outta here.

758
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,484
But he's just the cutest little witness.

759
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,990
Stay here.

760
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,378
Hi.

761
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,591
Uh, I'm a friend of Max Mayfield's,
over there.

762
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,763
You're Wayne Munson, aren't you?

763
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,431
Eddie's uncle?

764
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,141
That's right.

765
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,395
I heard you found the body.

766
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,982
- The neighbors, they were...
- Like to gossip.

767
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,736
And I'm not interested
in gossiping no more.

768
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,822
Certainly not to a reporter.

769
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,285
What gave me away?

770
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,499
Look, let me level with you, Mr. Munson.

771
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,711
The paper that I write for is… small.

772
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,423
We don't have the staff
to keep up with the big guys.

773
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,552
And I'm just… looking for something,

774
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,180
anything really,
about what happened last night.

775
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,098
Why?

776
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,935
Far as I can tell,
you all have it figured out already.

777
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,354
My nephew's a freak.

778
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,272
He killed that girl.

779
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,524
Ain't that about right?

780
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,693
Let me guess.

781
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,903
You've been speaking to the <i>Hawkins Post?</i>

782
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,489
Chuck Bailey?

783
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,783
Yeah, I used to work with him.

784
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,828
I mean, that guy
doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

785
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,083
Let me tell your side of the story.

786
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,643
<i>My nephew,</i>

787
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,439
<i>he may look dangerous,</i>

788
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,066
but he didn't do this.

789
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,863
It just… ain't in his nature.

790
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,911
No matter what anyone says,

791
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,164
and they will say things, believe you me.

792
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,749
But…

793
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,127
This… wasn't Eddie.

794
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,923
The man who did this…

795
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,469
Who killed that poor girl,

796
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,554
he's…

797
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,265
Pure evil.

798
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,684
"Man"?

799
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,439
You think you know
who might've done this?

800
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,110
You ever hear the name

801
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,780
Victor Creel?

802
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,916
<i>I guess you're too young,
but back when I was a kid,</i>

803
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,086
<i>everybody knew the name Victor Creel.</i>

804
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,630
He lost his mind.

805
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,299
Killed his whole family.

806
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,884
Kids and wife.

807
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,053
Took their eyes.

808
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,514
Cut 'em right out.

809
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,808
God.

810
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,561
<i>That poor girl
I found this morning,</i>

811
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,189
<i>same exact thing.</i>

812
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,149
<i>So I'm thinking</i>

813
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,068
<i>maybe he broke out.</i>

814
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,987
Victor Creel is still alive?

815
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,241
They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum.

816
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,035
Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there.

817
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,121
That is, unless he broke out.

818
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,126
<i>Like that… What's his name?
White mask and killed the babysitters?</i>

819
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>Michael Myers?</i>

820
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,381
<i>Yeah, Michael Myers.</i>

821
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,008
<i>You ask me, Victor's like that.</i>

822
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,137
He's a real boogeyman.

823
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,982
Um, I'll be right back.

824
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,783
Fred?

825
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,911
Fred!

826
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,498
Fred!

827
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,086
Fred?

828
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,631
Fred?

829
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,880
Murderer.

830
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,548
Murderer!

831
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,717
- Murderer. Murderer!
- Murderer.

832
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,385
Murderer.

833
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:48,975
Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

834
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,229
Murderer! Murderer!

835
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,399
Murderer!

836
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,420
You are no longer men.

837
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,466
You are cogs in a machine.

838
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:25,845
A machine in service
of our great Motherland.

839
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,185
And if you are foolish enough
to attempt escape,

840
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,730
you will be hunted down.

841
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,692
You will be captured.

842
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,028
And then you will suffer greatly

843
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,781
as you perform your final act

844
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,533
for the Motherland.

845
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,995
There will be no second chances.

846
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,083
Run,

847
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,543
you die.

848
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,337
You hear, American?

849
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,510
<i>Your friend is… stuck.</i>

850
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,264
<i>But you get me money, I make him unstuck.</i>

851
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,807
<i>You must trust me.</i>

852
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,309
<i>How do I trust...</i>

853
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,770
Joyce, whoever Enzo is,
the answer is not on that tape.

854
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,734
You don't hear that?
In the background?

855
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,694
So he's outside.

856
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,988
Someone's talking. Not surprising.

857
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,158
I think she's talking to Enzo.

858
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,493
Play it again.

859
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,710
Can you translate that?

860
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,546
Uh, I… I can't understand it.
It's too low.

861
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,775
Hey!

862
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,447
<i>But you get me
money, I make him unstuck.</i>

863
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,449
- Turn it up.
- <i>You must trust me.</i>

864
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,285
<i>How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.</i>

865
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,538
She… She wants to use the phone.

866
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,332
She's mad at Enzo.

867
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,293
- Calls him a "moosor."
- "Moosor"?

868
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,378
- It's slang.
- For what?

869
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,007
<i>Literally, "moosor" translates
to trash or garbage.</i>

870
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,051
Like "pig" here, often directed at cops.

871
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,636
Cops?

872
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,725
Or guards.

873
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,024
Hopper's stuck.

874
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:49,322
And Enzo can get him unstuck.

875
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,368
Yeah.
It's not exactly the Ritz, is it?

876
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,666
Welcome to your new home, American.

877
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,630
Enzo's a prison guard.

878
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,715
Maybe Hopper bribed him.

879
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,426
Sounds like Jim, doesn't it?

880
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,056
- Joyce, where are you going?
- Bank.

881
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,725
I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money,

882
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,728
and we are getting Hopper back.

883
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,605
Okay.

884
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,692
El?

885
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,360
What the hell? Get out!

886
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,196
- Not there?
- No.

887
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,575
- Should've told me she was having trouble.
- I didn't know they were gonna be here.

888
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,453
You knew she was having trouble for a year
and didn't tell me.

889
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,664
- I didn't know she was lying to you.
- Which is why you were a douche all day?

890
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,749
- I wasn't being a douche.
- You were.

891
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,336
You were rolling your eyes, moping.
You were barely talking.

892
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,548
- You basically sabotaged the whole day.
- She was lying to you.

893
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,176
Straight to your face,
ever since you got here.

894
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,804
And I've been a total third wheel all day.
It's been miserable.

895
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,183
So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling.

896
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,310
Yeah, whatever, man.

897
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,772
Well, what about us?

898
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,857
What?

899
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,359
You're mad that I didn't talk to you?

900
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,655
You made it super clear that you're
not interested in anything I have to say.

901
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,783
- That's just not true.
- You've called maybe a couple times.

902
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,535
It's been a year, Mike.

903
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,954
Meanwhile, El has
a book of letters from you.

904
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,540
- That's because she's my girlfriend, Will.
- And us?

905
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,334
We're friends. We're friends.

906
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,002
We used to be best friends.

907
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,715
Then maybe you should've
reached out more. I don't know.

908
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,300
But why is this on me?

909
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,885
Why… Why am I the bad guy?

910
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,560
Let's just…
Let's just find her. Okay?

911
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,217
Yeah.

912
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,027
- Oh my God, her face.
- Right?

913
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,154
- She looks like she shit herself.
- Yeah.

914
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,086
Angela.

915
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,923
- Uh-oh. Look who it is.
- She looks upset.

916
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,425
You ruined my day.

917
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,137
Oh no. Did we embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend?

918
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,389
I want you to say sorry to me,

919
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:05,393
and I want you to tell my boyfriend
that it was just a joke

920
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,437
and that we are really friends.

921
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,521
Or what?

922
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,399
You gonna hurt us
with your mean stare again?

923
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,364
Sorry you can't cry to teacher today.

924
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,075
You'll just have to cry
to your daddy instead.

925
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,828
Oh, wait. Can't do that either.

926
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,384
Hey!

927
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,560
Angela.

928
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,940
Holy shit. Angela, you okay?

929
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,151
- Angela, hey. You okay?
- Oh my God!

930
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,112
- What did she do?
- Oh my God.

931
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,031
- Oh my God, what do we do?
- Oh, shit.

932
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,784
You're okay. You're okay.

933
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,472
Oh… Oh my God.

934
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,723
Holy shit, El.

935
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,308
What did you do?

936
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,977
What did you do?

937
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,106
What have you done? What have you done?

938
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,432
Okay. Well, that's settled.
I guess he's not here.

939
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,726
- Eddie! It's Dustin!
- Great.

940
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,062
Look, we just wanna talk, okay?

941
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,606
No cops, I swear. We just wanna help.

942
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,067
Eddie!

943
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,152
Shh.

944
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,072
Rick!

945
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,533
Reefer Rick!

946
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,118
Don't scream that.

947
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,289
- Rick!
- He's not there.

948
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,458
- Reefer Rick!
- Just…

949
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,251
He could just be really high.

950
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,921
- Is that a foot?
- No, that's a shoe.

951
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,089
Hey, guys?

952
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,871
Hello?

953
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,999
Is anyone home?

954
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,384
What a dump.

955
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,531
What are you doing?

956
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,450
What are you doing?

957
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,952
He might be in here.

958
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,704
So take the tarp off.

959
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,748
If you're so brave, you take the tarp off.

960
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,383
Hey, look over here.

961
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,804
Someone was here.

962
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,598
Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran.

963
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,268
Don't worry.
Steve will get him with his oar.

964
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,978
I know you think you're being funny,

965
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,022
but considering everyone in this room
has nearly died a hundred times,

966
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,316
personally, I don't find it funny
in the slight...

967
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,985
Whoa!

968
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,570
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

969
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie! Eddie! Stop!

970
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,868
Eddie! Eddie!

971
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,995
It's me.

972
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,705
It's Dustin.

973
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,415
This is Steve.

974
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:41,252
He's not gonna hurt you, right, Steve?

975
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,503
Right. Yeah.

976
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,422
Steve, why don't you drop the oar?

977
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,802
He's cool. He's cool.

978
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,178
I'm cool, man. I'm cool.

979
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,848
- What are you doing here?
- We're looking for you.

980
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,891
We're here to help.

981
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,518
Eddie, these are my friends.

982
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,897
You know Robin, from band.

983
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,024
This is my friend Max.

984
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,192
The one who never wants to play D&D.

985
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:06,903
Eddie.

986
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,197
We're on your side.

987
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,075
I swear on my mother.

988
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,369
- Right, guys?
- Yes. Yes. We swear.

989
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,454
On Dustin's mother.

990
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,414
Yeah, Dustin's… Dustin's mother.

991
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,131
Jesus Ch…

992
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:42,730
Eddie…

993
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,571
We just want to talk.

994
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,574
Okay?

995
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,914
We want to know what happened.

996
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,835
You won't believe me.

997
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,214
Try us.

998
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,429
Fred!

999
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,683
Fred!

1000
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,603
Excuse me.

1001
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:24,480
Hi.

1002
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,526
Excuse me, sorry.
Have you seen my friend wandering around?

1003
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,528
Uh, nerdy, glasses, scar on his face?

1004
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,779
No, sorry.

1005
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,457
Hi, officer?

1006
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,418
- Officer?
- What are you still doing here?

1007
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,504
My… My friend from the car earlier,
I… I can't find him.

1008
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,964
What do you mean?

1009
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,425
He was there
and then he was just gone and…

1010
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,261
Did you maybe see him
leave with somebody or…?

1011
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,930
I told you kids to go home. Jesus Christ.

1012
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,433
This is Glenn.
We might have a situation here.

1013
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,999
Her body just, like,

1014
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:29,211
lifted up into the air and, uh…

1015
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,507
And she just, like, hung there.

1016
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,259
In the air.

1017
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,429
And her bones… Uh, she…

1018
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,267
Her bones started to snap.

1019
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,604
Her eyes, man.

1020
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,981
It… It was like there was something,

1021
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,984
like, inside her head, pulling.

1022
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,073
I… I didn't know what to do, so I…

1023
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,660
I ran away.

1024
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,372
I left her there.

1025
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,921
You all think I'm crazy, right?

1026
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,381
No. We don't think you're crazy.

1027
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,384
Don't bullshit me, man!
I know how this sounds.

1028
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,512
- We're not bullshitting you.
- We believe you.

1029
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,640
Look,

1030
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,892
what I'm about to tell you might be

1031
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,896
a little… difficult to take.

1032
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,357
Okay.

1033
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,818
You know how people say Hawkins is…

1034
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,694
Cursed?

1035
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,280
They're not

1036
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,366
way off.

1037
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,870
<i>There's another world.</i>

1038
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,501
<i>A world hidden beneath Hawkins.</i>

1039
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:56,632
Sometimes it bleeds into ours.

1040
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,301
Like ghosts and shit?

1041
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,845
There are some things

1042
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,556
worse than ghosts.

1043
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,646
Help me!

1044
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,878
No, no, no…

1045
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,339
<i>These monsters
from this other world…</i>

1046
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,842
- Help! Somebody!
- <i>…we thought they were gone.</i>

1047
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,178
- Nancy, please!
<i>- But they've come back before.</i>

1048
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,846
That's why we needed to find you.

1049
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,892
If they're back again, we need to know.

1050
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,352
Fred.

1051
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,027
<i>That night,</i>

1052
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,321
did you see anything?

1053
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,364
Dark particles, maybe?

1054
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:12,124
It would almost look like dust,
swirling dust.

1055
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,377
No, man, there was nothing
you could see or, uh…

1056
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,255
Or touch.

1057
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,178
What do you want?

1058
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,518
I want you

1059
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,980
to join me.

1060
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,900
No, no, no, no.

1061
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,877
<i>You know,
I tried to wake her, man.</i>

1062
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,796
She couldn't move.

1063
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:03,550
It was like she… she was
in a trance or something.

1064
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,136
Or under a spell.

1065
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,180
A curse.

1066
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,140
Vecna's curse.

1067
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,199
Who's Vecna?

1068
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:33,080
An undead creature of great power.

1069
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,749
A spell caster.

1070
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,627
A dark wizard.
