00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,840
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,560
I couldn't send Neron into hell
without sending Dez down with him.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,320
I killed the man I loved,
and for what?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,040
John, you have to stop this.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,520
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell
and you don't join the Legends,

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,080
the effects could be cataclysmic.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,040
History be bloody damned.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,320
I really care about you.

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,280
This thing between us, it isn't real.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
It never was.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,560
- What's that?
- I think John just broke time.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,520
Oy, see, check this out.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,840
I got my powers back.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Zari.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,480
Constantine did it.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
He changed the timeline
back in New Orleans.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,920
He saved old Dez.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Unfortunately, I have no idea
why you're a cat, Z.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh, quit your whinging.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,640
I know it's a pretty raw deal
for you.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
Especially 'cause...

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,840
well, who knows
what they put in cat food.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
On the plus side
you are cute as hell.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,920
Z, it has been an experience.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,360
Now, I'm gonna set the autopilot
to take you back to the Waverider,

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,560
but first we're gonna drop me
off somewhere fabulous.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,400
Hope y'all are thirsty for champagne.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,000
Because I'm feeling a little bubbly.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,120
Hello, Red.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Ms. Monroe.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,760
How's lady luck treating you?

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,240
Red, it's me. Charlie.

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,360
Shape-shifter.

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Cheers to Saint Patrick.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,920
{\an5}I haven't seen you
since we escaped from that prison.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,960
Yeah. Hey listen, mate.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,400
{\an5}You got to stop doing
your leprechaun magic

39
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
{\an5}so out in the open like this,
all right?

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
I do this all the time.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,280
{\an5}These humans,
they don't notice anything.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Watch.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
Lucky 11. Winner!

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Quit doing that.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
But I'm just having a little fun.

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
What's got you so worried?

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
The Magic Police?

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
{\an5}They're called the Legends
and I'm just trying

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
{\an5}to stay off their radar
for a little while.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Sounds to me like you're scared.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
What, of them?

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
No, no, no, they're not dangerous.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
They're just annoying little
boy scouts, you know?

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,320
{\an5}Reach for the sky,
you filthy animals.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Pretty please.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
He asked nicely.

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,400
Greetings, gentlemen.

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
The leprechaun.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
You fellas play?

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
No.

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
Why did you do that?

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,200
Marilyn Monroe.

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,040
{\an5}I am killing it
at historical figure bingo.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,520
All right, everyone, calm down.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
We just saved your butts

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,560
{\an5}from a very dangerous
magical creature.

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,040
Who are you guys?

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Hi, Nate Heywood. Monster hunter.

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
Just wanted you ladies
to know you're in good hands.

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,800
{\an5}Man, Garima is gonna flip
when she hears we met Marilyn Monroe.

72
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Do you think a murderous alien queen

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080
{\an5}that sprang to life from Mick's
fantasies is into Marilyn?

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,600
What is up with these guys?

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,080
{\an5}Gideon, any messages
while we were gone?

77
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,720
<i>You missed calls from Barry Allen,
Oliver Queen, and Kara Zor-El.</i>

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Sounds like the annual crossover.

79
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,040
Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass.

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
Did I tell you Oliver owes me money?

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,960
{\an5}I bet this year
they'll swap costumes.

82
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,040
Oh, Zari.

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,880
Well, I'm glad to see that you
made it back to the ship okay.

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
Okay, I hear you.

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
You're still mad at me.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,320
Listen, I really need your help.

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,200
All right, yeah,
I can see that being a cat

88
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
is your main concern right now,

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,400
but I still don't know
why you're a cat.

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
Ms. Tomaz was turned into a cat

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,920
during the team's encounter
with a Fairy Godmother.

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,880
Gideon, your latest upgrade, smoking.

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,280
Thank you, Miss Jiwe.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,560
Amaya Jiwe, yup, that's me.

95
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,640
And may I say your new upgrade
and accent are also smoking.

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Oh, yeah.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
You know, I'm just trying
something out.

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,400
Yeah, okay, one last question.

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,280
Why are the Legends homicidal
wankers now?

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,520
If you're referring to the Custodians
of the Chronology,

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,360
their policy towards
magical creatures

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
has been shoot on sight

103
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
since their disastrous encounter
at Woodstock.

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
Right. Thanks, Gideon.

105
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,680
{\an5}Must be fallout from Constantine
altering the timeline.

106
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,200
{\an5}Right, this zero tolerance
bollocks ends now.

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760
Hey, people!

108
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,960
I have an announcement to make.

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,680
Please, gather around.

110
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Come listen.

111
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,520
{\an5}So, I know our shoot-first,
ask-questions-never policy

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,840
has lead to some interesting
decorations,

113
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,560
but it's time to change.

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,840
From now on we are going
to capture the magical creatures

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
and bring them to the Bureau
like we are supposed to.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,080
Why are you looking at me weird?

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,120
Well, just seems like a shame
to change our policy now.

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Considering we're so close
to capturing our white whale.

119
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
That's a <i>Moby Dick</i>reference.

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,120
And what is your white whale?

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
The only creature
we haven't been able to capture

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,320
because it's quite elusive.

123
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Maybe because it has the ability
to change shape.

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Shape-shifter!

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,880
How dare you step on this ship
and pretend to be our dead captain.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,840
What?

127
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,960
Wait, Sara's dead?

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,160
Yeah, that's why we know
you're not Sara.

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
Is that why you guys are like this?

130
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Like what?

131
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
Hunting down magical creatures
like it's a...

132
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes!

133
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
Damn it, Garima.

134
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,320
I called dibs on killing
shape-shifter last week.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,760
You know what? He did.

136
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,960
You remember when we were roasting
that little baby Gryphon,

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,920
which was delicious, by the way,
but you guys got into an argument

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,160
about who actually killed it,
so then Ray got upset

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,960
and he was like, "Hey,
I wanna kill the shape- shifter."

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
Oh, it heals itself
and turns into Amaya.

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
This is not good.

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,840
- Kill her again!
- I get to kill her this time.

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
After her!

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Zari. Oh, bollocks.

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
Go, go! Come on, Ray!

146
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,840
Hey, hey...

147
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Make sure she doesn't steal anything!

148
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,160
They've become maniacs.

149
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay, this is bad.

150
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,600
What, Constantine?
Yes, this is his fault.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,200
He needs to help us fix this,
but where is he?

152
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,960
Nice work, Zari cat.

153
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
I can't very well walk around here
looking like this.

154
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Oh, hush, it's still me
despite the insane grin on my face.

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,160
I don't remember there being
a memorial here.

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
{\an5}Sara Lance struck down by unicorn.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Bollocks.

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,840
Gary, you're late.

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,880
Sorry, Mr. Heywood,

160
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,880
my cat-sitter quit on me, so...

161
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,800
This place is going to hell
in a hand basket.

162
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,080
Yeah, it's my bad, sir.

163
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Look, the Custodians
of the Chronology

164
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,200
just destroyed a freaking leprechaun.

165
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
All right, you know what?

166
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,760
If you see them, tell them they're
getting a scream-down from me.

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Heywood.

168
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Have you seen
John Constantine around?

169
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,760
Is that a joke?

170
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
He's been in confinement for months.

171
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,360
You put him there.

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
- Idiots.
- Right.

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
This isn't the when,
when I'm supposed to be.

174
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
Johnny? Johnny?

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,120
No, the truth is not the truth!

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,960
All right, this is not the when,
when I'm supposed to be.

177
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
You should go.
This was real charming.

178
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Reality is fractured, but the pieces,

179
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,320
they speak to each other like light
between broken mirrors.

180
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,960
John Constantine.

181
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
Confined for becoming
dangerously unstable

182
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,520
after suspected time crimes.

183
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,320
Are you real? Do you exist?

184
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Because it's really hard
to tell these days.

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,040
Yup, bloke's gone cuckoo.

186
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,760
I sense a familiar face.

187
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,400
Who is that?

188
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Z? Z, Is that you?

189
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,360
Why the transmogrification?
Let's get this sorted out.

190
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Yeah, all right, I'm sorry,
but this is the only way

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,400
that you will know your true self.

192
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, finally.

193
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Hairball.

194
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Because of you dicks,
I have been a cat for so long.

195
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,120
Do you know
where this tongue has been?

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Places.

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,960
I wasn't sure that reversal
was gonna work

198
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,280
because I've been feeling a little,
you know, insane lately.

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,520
Yeah, well, you only have
yourself to blame.

200
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Wait, what?

201
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,840
You created a time wave

202
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
when you changed your past
with Desmond.

203
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,800
Because you're the epicenter,

204
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,160
your experience of this timeline and
that one both exist in your brain.

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,360
Just give me a break here.

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,400
All right, what you're trying
to say is that I broke time?

207
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,160
Yes, back in New Orleans.

208
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,800
Sure, you don't have to live
with the guilt of damning Desmond,

209
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,800
but you also never joined
the Legends.

210
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,960
Without John's help
with the unicorn at Woodstock,

211
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,800
Sara died, which made
the Legends into killers.

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
Well, there's only one way
to fix this.

213
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,400
We go to back to Woodstock
and we save Sara.

214
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,000
- Yeah.
- No!

215
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,960
Guys, you're not listening to me.

216
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,800
You have to go to New Orleans
and set history back on track.

217
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
Whoa, whoa, Z.

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,200
You're suggesting a total reset
of the timeline.

219
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
What we need is a surgical strike.

220
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,800
Now, if we save Sara,

221
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
then the Custodians
of the Chronology never exist.

222
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,760
I keep my powers,
Dez is de-demoned, Bob's your uncle.

223
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm sorry, guys.

224
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,640
I have to stop you before you
before you make this any worse.

225
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
All right, then.

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm sorry, love.

227
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Until you can learn
to stay out of my way, then you...

228
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
are a cat.

229
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,120
- In the mood for a prison break?
- Oh, yes I am.

230
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,600
Is the coast clear?

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,720
How much of that did you hear?

232
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
Nothing at all.

233
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,280
Nothing about breaking out
or hacking history.

234
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,040
Please don't turn me into a cat.

235
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
Well, I didn't turn her into cat.

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,640
I returned her to being a cat,

237
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
which is considerably easier,
believe me.

238
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,360
But if you gotta,
maybe a Calico and real fluffy.

239
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
Okay, I'm ready. Do it.

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,000
- What are we gonna do with her?
- I have no idea.

241
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,920
You don't have to do anything.
I wanna help.

242
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,000
You do?

243
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,600
The Custodians of the Chronology
must be stopped.

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,560
They turned my Kaupe friend
into a rug.

245
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
So, if you're trying to defeat them,

246
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I want in.

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,400
Watch the bumps, yeah?

248
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,640
- Oi!
- Someone might hear you.

249
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,360
<i>Red Alert, the Waverider
is landing. Red Alert.</i>

250
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh, man, the Custodians are here.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Could things get any worse?

252
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Wait, stop right there.

253
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,920
Are you me?

254
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
Yes.

255
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
From the future.

256
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,600
Do I ever find love,
or at least my sunglasses?

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,720
They might be in my other pants.

258
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes, Gary, all that and more.

259
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,600
It's the Custodians!
Notify Mr. Heywood.

260
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
But right now, I need you
to delay the Custodians.

261
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,640
Okay. Oh, but be careful.

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,600
There's been reports
of a shape-shifter on the loose.

263
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,840
Yeah, I know that already.

264
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
Because I'm you
from the future, dummy.

265
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Okay. Okay.

266
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Come on.
We gotta find a place to hide.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Knock, knock, anybody home?

268
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,640
<i>There's a letter on the desktop</i>

269
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,400
Come on, hurry up!
Let me out of this thing.

270
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
Oh, God.

271
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Where are we?

272
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,120
This is Ava's office, but she's gone.

273
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,920
Gone, gone?

274
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
I'm right here, you idiots.

275
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,360
Dad, we tracked a shape-shifter here,
so we're gonna need you to stand down

276
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,480
and let us do our job
and bag it for you.

277
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,760
Your job, son,
is to bring the creatures

278
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,040
back to the Bureau alive.

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
Not leave their insides
strewn through history.

280
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,520
It's called payback
for what they did to Sara,

281
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,080
and don't get in our way.

282
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,120
Sharpie? What happened to you?

283
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm allowed to grieve in my own way.

284
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,080
Why the hell are you
out of your cell?

285
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,840
Well, plans change, luv.

286
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Are you sure you're okay,
Director Sharpe?

287
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,320
I'm fine!

288
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,680
Okay, I'm just taking some time
to get my head together

289
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,680
after Sara was unicorned.

290
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm really sorry about that.

291
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,400
Things are not as they seem.

292
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,800
- Amaya?
- No.

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,360
Well, it's a long story,
but time is, well, broken.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you see,

295
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,960
you're living in a timeline
that doesn't exist,

296
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,920
and we are from a timeline
where your hair is still blonde.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,960
Okay, I don't have time
for this timey-wimey crap.

298
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
No, no, this is the truth.
Now, listen.

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,640
The Custodians of the Chronology
are actually the Legends of Tomorrow

300
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
and they're the good guys, mostly.

301
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
Yeah, and the kicker is Sara
is supposed to be alive.

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
Did you say Sara's alive?

303
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,520
- Yeah.
- I knew it!

304
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
I knew something was wrong.

305
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,920
I mean, I like the Indigo Girls,
but they should not be a way of life.

306
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,920
Then let's help them
set things right.

307
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,840
What do you guys need from me?

308
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,640
Well, well, well, look
who's helping our magical fugitive.

309
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,120
Smith! Take position.

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
We were looking for you.

311
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,320
Got eyes on suspects.

312
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,160
Thought you might want
to have some fun.

313
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
I got 12 gauges of fun right here.

314
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,280
That's it.
I'm placing you all under arrest.

315
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,160
Shut your mouth, pops.

316
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,160
Go!

317
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
Take cover!

318
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,800
Get them out of here!

319
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,320
I'll cover you. Go save Sara.

320
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
Did they really all
just kill each other?

321
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Don't think about it.

322
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
And we'll go back in time
and we'll fix things.

323
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
We have to.

324
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
Target ahead.

325
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,160
Arming the weapons now.

326
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Is that what I think it is?

327
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Twilight Sparkle come to life.

328
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,560
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

330
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
- Yes!
- Nice shot!

331
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
Who the hell's in the jump ship?

332
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,960
Who cares? Mission accomplished.

333
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
And you guys thought
we needed Constantine.

334
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,480
Yeah, we saved Sara's life.

335
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
Now that should fix everything.

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,800
The Custodians should be back
to being the Legends,

337
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,240
and Zari should no longer be a cat.

338
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
All right, this might be
a crossed wired thing

339
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,760
in my brain, but that is still
a cat sitting there, isn't it?

340
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,800
Killing the unicorn
didn't solve the problem.

341
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,680
No, Zari, we're not going
back to New Orleans.

342
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
We need to find out what's wrong
with this timeline and fix it.

343
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,280
All right, we go back to the Bureau,
figure out our next step.

344
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,520
{\an5}<i>Charlie, come on. Talk to me, love.</i>

345
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,440
What's happening?
Is everything normal?

346
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
No.

347
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,440
In fact, things are pretty far
from normal.

348
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,560
No reason to panic.
We still got this.

349
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,600
Right, we'll find out
how the boys died in this timeline,

350
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,200
then we'll go back and save them,
and hopefully when they return

351
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
they won't be magical
creature murderers.

352
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,920
Right, sounds so simple.

353
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Hey, watch it.

354
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,880
Out of the way, suckers.

355
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Make way for S.O.S.

356
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
What the hell is S.O.S.?

357
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,160
Good morning, Sirens.

358
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
Good morning, Hank.

359
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, I hope you're ready
to go to work today

360
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,160
because we have one hell
of a case on our hands.

361
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,920
If anyone knows what happened
to the guys, it'll be them.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
<i>Hang tight on the ship.</i>

363
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Looks like I'm joining the S.O.S.

364
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,760
All right, ladies.
Weapons check.

365
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,840
Way ahead of you, babe.

366
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
My pistol's hot and ready.

367
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,960
Hey, girls. Save some fun for me.

368
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,440
Amaya, what are you doing here?

369
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,280
We thought you went back to 1942.

370
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,480
I did, but then I heard
about your monster problem,

371
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
and, well, I couldn't stay away.

372
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
It's perfect timing.

373
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,200
We are up to our peaches
with magical creatures

374
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,880
and about to kick some ass.

375
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
I'm in.

376
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,880
Johnny, just be honest with me.

377
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,800
This thing between us, it isn't real.

378
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
It never was. It doesn't exist.

379
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,040
Get it together, John.

380
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Come on. Get your head together.

381
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know what you're thinking.

382
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,240
You want me to put things
back the way they were,

383
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,080
but that's not gonna bloody happen.

384
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
No, I'm not all right to be honest.

385
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,480
So, what kind of fun costumes
are we gonna need for this mission?

386
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
We don't do costumes anymore.

387
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,080
Yeah, we stopped
so we could streamline missions.

388
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,760
Yeah, why get all dressed up
if we're just wasting

389
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,480
these magical creatures
straight away.

390
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,640
I mean, please tell me you don't keep
a trophy room of their skulls.

391
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,720
What do we look like? Barbarians?

392
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,640
- No, we just toss them.
- You what?

393
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
Yeah, ever since
that Fairy Godmother killed

394
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
Nate, Ray, and Rory
we just waste any magical creature

395
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
that comes in our path.

396
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
No questions asked.

397
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,640
Well, they can't all be bad.

398
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,960
We haven't met a good one.

399
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,560
Hey, how is Zambesi?

400
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
- Who?
- Zambesi.

401
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Where you're from.

402
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,960
It's great. Yeah, it's, like, chill.

403
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Super chill.

404
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,320
If I do what you ask,

405
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,880
I'd be sending Desmond to hell.

406
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,920
Yeah, I know, maybe
I deserve this insanity.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,280
Oh, you're all soft.

408
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,880
Oy, wake up, losers.
I know how to fix it.

409
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,560
Right, we got to take care
of the Fairy Godmother in Salem.

410
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,080
Fire up the ship.
I'm heading up there now.

411
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
Cor blimey.

412
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,040
No more tea and crumpets
for this dodgy doppelganger.

413
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,440
Hard Drive here knew
you weren't really Amaya all along.

414
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,960
I'm equipped to detect
shape-shifter pheromones.

415
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,240
How fortunate our white whale
swam right into our net.

416
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,040
What is with you guys
and white whales?

417
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,840
Oh, you really think
you three can take me?

418
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,840
Oh, I can take you alone.

419
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,560
Damn it. Get back here!

420
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,560
Oh, hey.
How were the Sirens in Space-Time?

421
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,240
Well, they're not the Custodians.

422
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,600
They may actually be worse.

423
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
Now, let's go save the lads.

424
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,240
{\an5}The three of you have been
so rude with your nasty attitude.

425
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,600
It will be ever so sublime

426
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,920
<i>To slowly choke you up with vines</i>

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,880
Whatever you're gonna do, Charlie,
you better make it fast.

428
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
I got this.

429
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,680
<i>A peach or a cherry</i>

430
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,440
<i>Any good thing to make us so merry</i>

431
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Prudence.

432
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,920
Fairy Godmother, are you finished?
That was fast.

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Yes, and I was thinking,

434
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
if I'm to be your Fairy Godmother,

435
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
you must start behaving
like a proper young lady.

436
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
How do you mean?

437
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,480
Oh, nothing dreadful
or out of the ordinary.

438
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,520
Just chores, daily baths,
church service each morning,

439
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,560
and you must start eating broccoli.

440
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,320
But I don't want all that.

441
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,520
Well, until our bond is severed,
I'm afraid that's the way it must be.

442
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,640
Now, eat the broccoli.

443
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,360
Fairy Godmother, I relinquish you.

444
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
That's cool.

445
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,280
<i>I alone may become satiated</i>

446
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,880
<i>When you're all asphyxiated</i>

447
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,000
My bond with Prudence
has been severed.

448
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,600
Oh, fiddlesticks.

449
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,680
You know, I hate to jinx us,

450
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,960
but I really think
we nailed it this time.

451
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
I just hope you guys are right.

452
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,040
What's wrong?

453
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
What are you looking at?

454
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,880
There something on my nose?

455
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Bollocks.

456
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,120
- Anything yet?
- Don't rush me, luv.

457
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,880

for us in here.

Sounds like a team meeting.

460
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,520
I'll just pop in
and say hello, shall I?

461

<i>So, put on your

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,640
Well, today we learned about
the importance of cooperating.

480
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
And about the number three.

481
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,960
And about a famous man
from history named Napoleon.

482
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,160
I think I need a drink.

483
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
We can help.

484
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>When you're thirsty for a drink</i>

485
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,480
<i>And you just can't reach a sink</i>

486
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,120
<i>You gotta ask for a help</i>

487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,880
No, stop.
All right, please, please.

488
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,320
No more singing.

489
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,800
Just tell me, why are you puppets?

490
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Because Rory called us a bunch
of Time Bureau puppets.

491
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,120
Yeah, and then he ran off
with his new partner in crime.

492
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
So, did you figure out
how I turned into a damn puppet?

493
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
Yeah, it's worse than I thought.

494
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,280
After we managed to separate
the Fairy Godmother from Prudence,

495
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,280
she somehow glommed onto Rory.

496
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,080
You can probably figure out the rest.

497
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Well, we're just gonna have
to keep fixing what's broken

498
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
until we get it right.

499
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Yeah.

500
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Damn it.

501
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Nope.

502
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
No plaques.

503
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,400
No plaques. No plaques.

504
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,240
We did it. I'm shocked to bits.

505
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,000
Everyone's alive, Zari's human again,
and I still have my powers.

506
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,800
That's smashing news, luv.

507
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,840
Yeah, I mean, sure,
it's got a few cracks,

508
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,520
but fixed the timeline.

509
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
See that, Zari.

510
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,800
John, are you okay?

511
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
Yeah, yeah, it's, never better.

512
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
<i>John.</i>

513
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
<i>John.</i>

514
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
- What happened?
- Passed out, mate.

515
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
He didn't just pass out.

516
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
His brain can't handle

517
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,200
this wad of bandages
you call a timeline.

518
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,760
I can take the pain, luv.

519
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,920
What if you can't?

520
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,040
What if you die, John?

521
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,680
What happens to all the people
who need you alive and Constantine-y?

522
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah, well, you can leave
that to the real heroes, all right,

523
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
because I'm done giving a damn.

524
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,960
Oh, I see.

525
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,520
This is isn't about saving
Desmond anymore.

526
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,440
It's an excuse for you
to give up on yourself.

527
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,600
Just leave him alone, will you?

528
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,760
You think because there's no plaques
the world is fixed?

529
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,800
I promise you,
it's just as messed up out there

530
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,240
as it is in John's brain.

531
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,560
I know you don't want
to send Desmond to hell,

532
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,760
but that doesn't have to be
the end of the story.

533
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,400
You of all people can find a way
to keep fighting for him.

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,760
Go to New Orleans
and set things right.

535
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
Don't listen to her.

536
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,880
Come on, John. It's you and me.

537
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,600
We can make this timeline work.

538
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
No, Charlie.

539
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,240
We've tried over, and over, and over

540
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,120
to get what we wanted
and it hasn't worked.

541
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Well, Zari's right.

542
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,480
There's still hope for Desmond,

543
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,560
and maybe there's still hope
for your powers too.

544
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Hope?

545
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,480
My powers aren't some magic trick.

546
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760
They're who I am.

547
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,240
I'm not gonna just sit around
and hope that they come back.

548
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll fight for them.

549
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,360
This ain't over.

550
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,360
Not by a long shot.

551
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,280
Ava, I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

552
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,760
Yeah, the Bureau got
an emergency alert

553
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,080
about a magical presence
in New Orleans, 2018.

554
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,720
I thought maybe
we could check it out together.

555
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,240
- Let's get to work.
- Cool.

556
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Jeez.

557
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,600
I didn't live this specific moment,
but I remember it.

558
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,960
It's all part of jumbled,
bloody memory.

559
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,920
By the way, only about ten percent
of what you're saying

560
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
makes any sense,
but by all means continue.

561
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Right, so the earliest me
just left for the market.

562
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,280
The other one is upstairs
breaking up with Dez right now,

563
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,880
and when Dez leaves upset,
I stop him.

564
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Put things back to normal.

565
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>All right, good luck.</i>

566
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,760
Blimey, that's a lot of ammo.

567
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,120
- Blimey?
- Huh?

568
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,160
Oh, I meant wow.

569
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,200
All right, boys,
orders are shoot to kill.

570
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

571
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,640
Shouldn't we discuss what kind
of creature we're dealing with here?

572
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,440
We can't just go in guns a-blazing.

573
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
What if whatever's causing
this is just a little misguided?

574
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,520
It's a magical fugitive.

575
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,640
We kill those.

576
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,520
You two head out.
Stay on the comms.

577
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,920
I killed the man I loved,
and for what?

578
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,880
To buy New Orleans
a little more time?

579
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,120
Neron needs souls...

580
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,320
Okay, right, I think,

581
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,480
I think that something should be
landing right here any second now.

582
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,040
I work alone.

583
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Got it.

584
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
All right, Gideon,
what are we looking at?

585
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,040
<i>I've located multiple targets
on the ground</i>

586
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,360
<i>each one with a substantial
magical signature.</i>

587
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,600
Do we have a visual yet?

588
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,200
<i>Coming up now.</i>

589
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,160
Wait, that's John Constantine,
and there's more than one of him.

590
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,800
Looks like our shape-shifter
has a shape-shifter friend.

591
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
Wait a second, how do you know that

592
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,320
that's not really Constantine
out there?

593
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
Because it's John Constantine.

594
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
He doesn't time travel.

595
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
Believe me. I tried to recruit him.

596
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,920
Okay, so why don't we capture
all three of them

597
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,880
so we can find out
if any of them are the real John?

598
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,920
What is wrong with you?
You feeling okay?

599
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm fine.

600
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm just a firm believer
in taking precautions.

601
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,520
Precautions. Good one.

602
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
<i>Ray, Rory, what's your status?</i>

603
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
All right, we're in position,
with our sights on the shape-shifter.

604
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,800
When do we get to shoot?

605
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,960
<i>All right, on my mark, open fire.</i>

606
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Sara, don't.

607
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,240
Damn it, Ava, why not?

608
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,480
'Cause I'm the shape-shifter.

609
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,080
Guys, stand down,
we have a code blue on the ship.

610
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,280
What the hell's a code blue?

611
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,760
Just don't shoot yet.

612
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,960
There's something going on
in your life.

613
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
Just be honest with me.

614
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, do you know what?
This thing between us?

615
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,440
It isn't real. It never was.
It doesn't exist.

616
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
You should go.

617
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,080
Yeah, you're right. I should.

618
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,080
But this, this was real, Johnny.

619
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Hey, you, you dropped this.

620
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
My phone.

621
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,840
How did you get down here?
You were just upstairs.

622
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, never mind
about that right now.

623
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,520
I have something
really important to tell you.

624
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,440
You know what? I think you've said
quite enough today already...

625
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
No, no, Dez, please.

626
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Give me a minute, all right?

627
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,240
So, you're the shape-shifter.

628
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,120
Why do you look like Amaya?

629
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,000
It is complicated,
but this is how you know me.

630
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,200
What's happened to the Legends
to make you like this?

631
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
What do you mean?

632
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,640
You guys are so intent
on killing magical creatures.

633
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,160
Can't you see that this is wrong?

634
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
Not really.

635
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Look, now I know this sounds crazy,

636
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,120
but the me that you were just
speaking to upstairs

637
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
is my past.

638
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,120
So, you break up
with me out of the blue,

639
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,080
act like a total ass, and suddenly
that's in the past, just like that?

640
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,840
Listen, literally,
that is me from ages ago,

641
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,520
but the person who's standing
in front of you right now

642
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,800
is a little bit older
and he's a little bit wiser.

643
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,040
Sure. Still playing games, clearly.

644
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Look.

645
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
I thought this was real.

646
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,760
Yeah, it is real, Dez, and that's why

647
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,520
I moved heaven and earth
so that I could save you

648
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,040
from a lifetime
and eternity of anguish,

649
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
anguish that I caused.

650
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Look...

651
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,160
I guess what I'm trying to say
is I'm sorry you ever even met me.

652
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Don't be sorry.

653
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,560
Only a fool would fall in love
with John Constantine

654
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
and not expect it to be rocky.

655
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I knew the risks...

656
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,160
and I took them anyway for you.

657
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm still pissed at you.

658
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,800
Why can't we just go back
to the ways things were?

659
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
That's exactly what I was thinking.

660
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,640
- What is that?
- Know one thing, Desmond.

661
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm not quitting on you.

662
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,640
Sara, crazy-looking Constantine
just memory-flashed a civilian.

663
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,680
- Can we shoot him yet?
- Wait for my signal.

664
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm dealing with a situation
on the ship.

665
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,680
Constantine might be...

666
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
<i>Sara?</i>

667
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,360
- Sara?
<i>- Hold on a second, Ray.</i>

668
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Where did you get that?

669
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,520
Look, I don't know who you are,
or why you are on my ship,

670
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,560
but you're never leaving.

671
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,440
Oh, hello, handsome.

672
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,640
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the street?

673
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I was...

674
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,960
You... you went to the market.

675
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I did.

676
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
Next thing I know
I was standing in the street.

677
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,400
I don't, I don't know.

678
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,760
Wait, Sara, please.

679
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,480
Just tell me why you're so intent
on killing magical creatures.

680
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,120
Because that's how we stay alive.

681
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,400
Stop doing that!

682
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,520
- Don't you remember London?
- No.

683
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,880
When you and I first met

684
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,200
and I helped you see the truth
about magical creatures.

685
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,640
And how did you do that?

686
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
By being me?

687
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,960
By showing you that I'm not here
to hurt humans.

688
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,240
That not all monsters need
to be put down.

689
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,840
That's cute, but never happened.

690
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,200
What...

691
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,600
How can you not remember?

692
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,880
Bollocks.

693
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,400
Because of Constantine,
you and I never met

694
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
and you never changed.

695
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm the missing ingredient

696
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,320
in every one of these
botched timelines.

697
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm sorry, but all I see is a threat
that needs to be taken out.

698
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
Ray, fire when ready.

699
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,440
- So you got eggs?
- I got the eggs.

700
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,280
I got the bread.
Got everything we need.

701
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,400
Souffle?

702
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,080
Souffle, but first things first, eh.

703
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,320
<i>You need to be a part of the team.</i>

704
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,680
<i>Your shape-shifting days
are over, sweetheart.</i>

705
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,120
<i>- No!
- I know who's coming for you.</i>

706
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,440
<i>But choosing a life of magic,
it never leads to a happy ending.</i>

707
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,480
<i>That's the thing about time travel,
there's always a way.</i>

708
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
I'm sorry, Dez.

709
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,240
John, you okay?

710
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
Yeah, well...

711
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,040
my mind is no longer split in two,

712
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,280
but can't say the same
about my heart though.

713
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
You?

714
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,240
Well, lost my powers.
Back to being mortal.

715
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
Sorry, guys. It had to be done.

716
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,120
Well, let's go on
and find the Legends, shall we?

717
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,600
Yeah, see if all this was worth it.

718
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Yeah.

719
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
Well, everything seems
pretty normal so far.

720
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,120
This isn't over, you dingalings.

721
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,200
You better watch your knees,
Sara Lance.

722
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, no, is everyone a puppet again?

723
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
What?

724
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000
- What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you all!

725
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,640
I got an anti-magic isolation chamber
with your name on it, Mike the Spike.

726
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,840
The usual insanity that passes
for normal around here.

727
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,800
What is this?

728
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,040
Why are you being so weird?

729
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,400
Well, I...

730
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
I do have a little bit of a tale
to tell, to be honest.

731
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
You fancy a drink?

732
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,120
One of those stories.

733
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Let's go.

734
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Hey, Zari,
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

735
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,880
For what? For stuffing me into a bag
or almost destroying all of history?

736
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,600
Well, yeah, that too,
but what I'm really sorry about

737
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,720
is that we got off on the wrong foot.

738
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,720
You're a shape-shifter.
Your whole deal is tricking people.

739
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,560
Yeah, but now
I'm being honest with you.

740
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,200
You know, I could have been anyone
when I got my powers back.

741
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Do you know why I kept coming
back to this form?

742
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,800
Because Amaya is very hot?

743
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,400
It's because this is the form I was
when I joined the Legends.

744
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,000
Now, I have been a part
of many crews, and you guys,

745
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,200
well, you're not rubbish.

746
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Listen, destroying history
for personal gain,

747
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,480
it's happened to almost
everyone here.

748
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Rite of passage.

749
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,800
So you think I'm hot then?

750
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,680
I made snicker doodles
with your recipe.

751
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Not bad.

752
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,480
I'm reading your novel.
I'm on the last chapter.

753
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,280
Your females characters
are shallow, libidinous,

754
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,600
and so much fun to read.

755
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,240
- Thanks.
- Yeah, good job, Rebecca Silver?

756
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,520
Nom de plume.

757
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,800
Got it.

758
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,560
So let me get this straight.

759
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,520
They're making love
on the surface of the sun?

760
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,960
It's a metaphor.

761
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,080
Got it.

762
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,560
And the worst part?

763
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,880
It didn't even make
a bloody difference.

764
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,920
I was a fool thinking
I could outrun this fight

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
flying around with you lot.

766
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,160
Yeah, we tend to fly directly
into fights.

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,440
But we do it together,
and we have your back.

768
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,400
Well, as long as you know
what you're getting yourself into

769
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,160
because a demon like Neron,
he doesn't just want to win.

770
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,480
He wants to win
in the cruelest possible way.

771
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Yeah?

772
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,040
The Kaupe escaped?

773
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,320
Here's what I want you to do.

774
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,520
Track him down
and recapture him, or else.

775
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,120
There's been a setback,
but we'll make it right.

776
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,560
Oh, you'd better.
