[Clapping]

163
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,511
- [Man] Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

164
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,443
Come.

165
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:25,882
[Awasthi] Please, sir.

166
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,613
[Rudra] <i>In the entire room,</i>

167
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:38,318
<i>I felt like Anusha's eyes
were watching me.</i>

168
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,450
<i>Even I was dying internally.</i>

169
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:43,585
<i>But for now, I had to
focus on keeping myself alive.</i>

170
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,608
<i>The chess board had been laid out.</i>

171
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,326
<i>Now I had to make
every move carefully.</i>

172
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,586
<i>I had to somehow convince
the people sitting here that</i>

173
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,710
<i>this investigation is pointless.</i>

174
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,725
<i>And then I had a plan.</i>

175
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:56,815
So what have you decided?

176
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,163
I'll not take up this case.

177
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,987
Why? What's the problem?

178
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,132
It's an open-and-shut case.

179
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,881
We have all the CCTV footage.

180
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:08,781
Yes, sir.

181
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,837
Our suspect has fake
beard and moustache.

182
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,700
It can be clearly seen.

183
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,130
And if you see him
you'll get him immediately.

184
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,168
We have called
the sketch artist.

185
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,297
He'll make a picture of him
without the beard and moustache.

186
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,984
And then let's start the work.

187
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:23,293
I'm damn sure.

188
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:25,552
This case can be
solved in 48 hours.

189
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:27,788
So solve it. Why do you need me?

190
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:33,206
Actually Tyagi didn't file
a report of his daughter missing.

191
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,916
He got scared of the people
who made threats.

192
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,361
What do you want? Tell me that.

193
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,519
I want Tyagi's agreement.

194
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:41,186
What do you mean?

195
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,482
- Do you have the girl?
- No.

196
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,814
Then what are we investigating?

197
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,596
Agreed that you're convinced.

198
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,897
But Tyagi hasn't filed a report.

199
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,621
What if the girl comes back?

200
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,453
He has a point.

201
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:56,989
Point.

202
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,369
You guys sit here in the office.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,130
Everything seems
alright in the office.

204
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,625
I have spent three years
in jail due to this.

205
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:08,152
I can't do this. Sir.

206
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,087
[Rudra] <i>I had made my move.</i>

207
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,959
I understand your problem.

208
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,648
I'll talk to Tyagi.

209
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,437
His daughter is missing.
He too must be worried.

210
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,800
[Rudra] <i>There. The jackass
is suddenly concerned.</i>

211
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,267
<i>Darn the SSP.</i>

212
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,878
<i>The torch bearer of integrity.
Darn him.</i>

213
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,280
[Man] You focus on the case.

214
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,102
Awasthi, just brief him.

215
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,657
[Awasthi] Please, sir.

216
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,854
Come, sir.

217
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,884
- Is the CCTV footage ready?
- All is ready.

218
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,970
Sir is here.
He'll get that jackass.

219
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,121
He can't get away.

220
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:51,720
Listen, I understood this case.

221
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:54,288
It's my first day.
So give me a chance to think.

222
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:56,735
Where can I find this guy
who is a master at phone?

223
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,429
If you step out and turn right,

224
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,793
his shop is half a kilometer away
in that lane.

225
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,268
Okay. I'll go give it.

226
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,525
No. Why are you taking the trouble?

227
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:03,544
I'll send Surender.

228
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,131
- Surender.
- [Surender] Yes sir.

229
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,170
Why are you troubleling him?
He'll be required here.

230
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,533
He's not required
in the police force.

231
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:10,690
Why would he be required here?

232
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,114
- Come here. Go to Munna's shop...
- No. It's okay.

233
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:14,388
Where do we have to go?

234
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:16,619
[Awasthi] See this.
This is our suspect.

235
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,621
He is strong.

236
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,004
Get lost. One punch from sir
and he'll be flat on the ground.

237
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:21,967
[Shukla] See this.

238
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,430
He is walking around
as if no one saw him.

239
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,847
[Awasthi] Now
a person should be careful.

240
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,101
He is tall like a coconut tree.

241
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,063
He should understood that he
can be seen from a kilometer away.

242
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:34,509
Tall men are stupid.

243
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,710
No. Expect you.

244
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,675
He is a couple of inches
taller than you.

245
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:44,847
If I find this jackass
I'll stretch him it more.

246
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,175
[Shukla] Why are you getting
so worked up?

247
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,822
[Mishra] I am getting worked up.
It's about a girl.

248
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,459
[Rudra] <i>I was sure that Tyagi</i>

249
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,483
<i>will never agree
for the investigation.</i>

250
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,766
<i>It was the question of
his daughter's life after all.</i>

251
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,624
<i>But what if he agreed?</i>

252
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,495
<i>What if the SSP convinces him?</i>

253
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:05,525
<i>A dead girl, a dead phone
and missing lady</i>

254
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,624
<i>had made my life miserable.</i>

255
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,538
One minute. Pause.

256
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,748
See this.
This rascal has moved the camera.

257
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:18,345
And then he must have jumped off.

258
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,718
How would he have jumped off it?

259
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:21,577
He must have drugged the girl.

260
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,561
Gagged her and then
he must have jumped off.

261
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:25,977
- That sounds right.
- See this.

262
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:27,930
[Shukla] Look at this couple.

263
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,466
I'm sure this is that jackass.

264
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:34,483
And I'm sure his backup
must be ready there.

265
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:35,551
Yes, sir.

266
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:39,033
Once SSP sir gets the consent from
Tyagi the case will gain momentum.

267
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,015
- We'll get him in 48 hours.
- 12 hours.

268
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,365
[Shukla] It will require 24 hours
at the least.

269
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,494
[Mishra] How 24 hours?

270
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,977
Quiet. Have you gone mad?

271
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,564
Does this look like
Rajan Iqbal's story?

272
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,836
What will you say
when Tyagi comes?

273
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:56,525
One man climbed down
the pipe with his girl.

274
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,579
Alone. Didn't she shout or cream?

275
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,236
Why? Did she get
kidnapped willingly?

276
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,852
And even if she was drugged,

277
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:09,284
I challenge any of you
to make two rounds of this station.

278
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:10,929
With someone on your shoulder.

279
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,775
Got down from the pipe.

280
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:14,682
And what did you say?

281
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:16,908
The rest of the team
is waiting at the bus station.

282
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:18,210
At the bus station?

283
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,667
At Ghaziabad's most crowded place.

284
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,474
They changed buses there
and no one saw a thing.

285
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:28,861
And why are you
showing me repeatedly?

286
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,686
She is going with him willingly.

287
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,435
Not in his lap drugged.

288
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,117
What's going on here?

289
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:37,012
Are you creating a Bhojpuri movie's story?

290
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,481
And they're going to solve
the kidnapping case. Jackasses.

She is 19.

you sent a man after me.

You don't know how that happened.

Now the SSP is sitting before you.
You don't know how that happened.

- Put the phone on speaker mode.
- On speaker?

351
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,610
Put it on speaker, jackass.
Keep it in front of him.
