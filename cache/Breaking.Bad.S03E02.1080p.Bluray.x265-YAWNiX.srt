1
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,415
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,208
Oh, okay.

3
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,462
Down means off.

4
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,675
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

5
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,969
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

6
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,430
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't...

7
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,182
No, sir, your windshield.

8
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,478
License and registration, please.

9
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,522
Right.

10
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,572
This... this was from wayfarer 515.

11
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,660
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.

12
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,373
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

13
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,084
Some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

14
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,419
I understand.

15
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,885
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

16
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,471
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of wayfarer 515.

17
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,057
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

18
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,727
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,980
What? What, you don't believe me?

20
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,441
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

21
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,737
This car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

22
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,660
Wait. Waitjust a minute.
Just one minute.

23
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,996
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.

24
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,915
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

25
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,875
It's time for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,753
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is america, okay?

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,756
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights. You understand that?

28
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,718
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

29
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,137
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

30
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,431
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?

31
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,933
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,853
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

33
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,897
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house...

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,399
Where my children sleep!

35
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,652
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,779
- Are you kidding me?!
- Sir, last warning.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,906
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?

38
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,577
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

39
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,956
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the first amendment!

40
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,485
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,948
Border patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

42
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,203
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of juarez into laredo.

43
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,538
Border patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

44
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,499
With these pol/eros for two years.

45
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,919
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

46
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,504
Hit them hard.

47
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,174
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

48
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,676
So this truck was carrying more
than just people.

49
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,887
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,890
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

51
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,934
Why'd the border patrol
kick this to us?

52
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,061
They didn't. I pulled it.

53
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,106
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,485
Question is, why do we have
juarez-style action...

55
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,570
On our side of the dmz?

56
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,114
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

57
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,118
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

58
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,164
Maybe one of those extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,542
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

60
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,710
All right, that's it. Slow news day.

61
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,879
Add one more to the countdown.

62
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,714
Oh, yeah? What's that, gomey?

63
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,217
We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

64
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,053
Twenty-nine days since
we saw it last.

65
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,098
It's still out there, gomey.
Don't worry.

66
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,433
Local p.D. I gotta take this.

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,227
Gomey, go beat your pinata.

68
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,480
Rest of you jokers,
too damn quiet in here.

69
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,691
Catch some bad guys.

70
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,651
Schrader.

71
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,862
Hey, what's up, Walt?

72
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,614
What?

73
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,248
Jesse?

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,710
Hey, dad.

75
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,673
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

76
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,471
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,516
You doing okay?

78
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,019
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

79
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,523
I just happened to be driving by
and saw the sign.

80
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,568
So you're selling the place.

81
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,614
In this market. Can you believe it?

82
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,534
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

83
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,329
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

84
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,665
We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

85
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,001
Sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

86
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,755
Right on.

87
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,011
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

88
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,307
I read that in, I wanna say,
like time magazine.

89
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,062
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

90
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,065
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

91
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,486
Granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-ofâ€”the line.

92
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,199
Damn. That's great, dad.
Think I can get a tour?

93
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:16,663
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

94
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,293
There are pictures on the website,
if you want to take a look.

95
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,759
You're looking healthy.

96
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,721
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

97
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:43,773
You know, I could come by sometime
for dinner or something.

98
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,861
Yeah. Sometime.

99
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,033
Okay.

100
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,160
Later, dad.

101
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,135
You know, look,
he's a high-school teacher.

102
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,971
He's never been in trouble
a day in his life.

103
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,098
He finds out he's got lung cancer...

104
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,144
And now his wife kicks
the poor bastard out of his own house.

105
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:27,734
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates
a little slack, here's the guy.

106
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:40,997
Hey, Walt.
Remember officer Cavanaugh?

107
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,091
Officer, I'm very sorry that
I lost my temper.

108
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,930
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.

109
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,937
Yeah. Thanks, man.

110
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,291
She's divorcing me.

111
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,089
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

112
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,134
It is what it is.

113
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,681
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

114
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,853
She said that?

115
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,463
You don't write, you don't call.

116
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,390
It's a disaster.

117
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,352
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.

118
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,563
It's not a disaster, all right?

119
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,983
She's not going to the cops,
she's not gonna tell a living soul.

120
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,989
You wanna know why?
One word: Blowback.

121
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,369
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster,
for her.

122
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,791
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed.
You were right under his nose.

123
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,754
He'll be lucky if they let him
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

124
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,423
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.

125
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,886
My daddy's a drug dealer
and my mommy turned him in.

126
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,599
And the house? Gone. Feds would
rico her and the kids out on the street.

127
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,145
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No. It's not gonna happen.

128
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,192
She's bluffing and she knows it.

129
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,285
Her going to the police
is not the point, Saul.

130
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,538
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

131
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,627
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.

132
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,006
Hey, buddy.

133
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,469
- It's bad. It's a calamity.
- Oh, my god.

134
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,847
But we live to fight another day.

135
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,143
And after a decent interval of time...

136
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,438
Well, there are other fish
in the sea.

137
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,442
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

138
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,612
You'll be just amazed at
what's out there.

139
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,240
Thailand, the Czech Republic.

140
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:07,745
I mean, those women are so grateful
to even be here.

141
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,042
In the meantime,
idle hands are the devil's plaything.

142
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,381
So why don't you get back on the horse
and do what you do best?

143
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,635
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.

144
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,770
I can't be the bad guy.

145
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
What?

146
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,194
I can't be the bad guy.

147
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,826
Okay.

148
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,457
You know, we'll revisit.

149
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:59,380
Just promise me
you won't hang yourself in the closet.

150
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,039
Pop-pop!

151
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,793
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!

152
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,054
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

153
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,941
- Yeah.
- It's me. We may have a wife problem.

154
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,777
Look, I need eyes on it.

155
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,988
You got an address?

156
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,469
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.

157
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,265
Uncle Hank and aunt Marie
are bringing takeout...

158
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,144
But if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

159
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,383
Hey, buddy,
pass the ketchup, will you?

160
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,939
What? I've had enough trans-fat
for one lifetime.

161
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,941
Two-day drive
from the nearest ocean...

162
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,652
And you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.

163
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,657
Been awhile since that minnow's
been swimming. Right, buddy?

164
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,707
You know, Flynn here is looking
for a part-time job...

165
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,960
So, I don't know, if you know of
anything you might want to...

166
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,379
My name's Walter Jr.

167
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,717
Like, what,
you can't even say his name?

168
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,054
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn...

169
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,974
All you need to do is just tell me
that you don't want to be called Flynn.

170
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,519
Dad didn't even show up
till fourth period.

171
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,688
And his eyes were all red,
like he's been crying or something.

172
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,942
But you, you don't even care!

173
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,487
And now he won't even
drive me home.

174
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:14,033
He won't say why, but I know
it's because you told him not to.

175
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,494
- Honey, I...
- What?

176
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,205
I don't know what your problem is.

177
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:24,335
You may not love him anymore,
but I do.

178
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,340
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?!

179
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,259
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Oh, god.

180
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,762
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...

181
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,473
It's all right.

182
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
Hey, hey.

183
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,024
Skyler, I know that you must have
your reasons for all of this.

184
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,571
Sky, the...

185
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,908
I know it's none of my business...

186
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,871
But keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...

187
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,921
You're right, Hank.

188
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,925
It's none of your business.

189
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,809
Oh, my god. After all of that?

190
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,604
Please, tell me
that you are still not curious.

191
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,523
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.

192
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,526
The day I heard the words
"second cell phone," I knew.

193
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,030
- Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay. All right.

194
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,033
So, what? Stop dancing around it.

195
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,869
What is it exactly that you have seen
a hundred times?

196
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,621
Please, please, enlighten me.

197
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,417
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.

198
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,129
But, let's face it, underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

199
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,466
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.

200
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,427
He acts up. He steps out.

201
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,681
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

202
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,227
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.

203
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:10,691
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

204
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,027
I... I don't know.

205
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,782
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

206
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:23,120
It just feels like something more.

207
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,465
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?

208
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,217
How much is this gonna run me?

209
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,388
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

210
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,015
Yeah, I'll call you.

211
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,893
Return of the prodigal,
back to the land of the living.

212
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,603
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

213
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,399
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

214
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,112
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

215
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:01,742
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to god, I'm jealous.

216
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,622
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

217
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,835
Your former partner. This guy,
he works like a bastard, right?

218
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,628
Builds a business single-handed.

219
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,133
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

220
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,471
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

221
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,891
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

222
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,520
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

223
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,981
But you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

224
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,024
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

225
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,736
All right, all right, scratch that.

226
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,072
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

227
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,992
All due respect.

228
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,037
You want a job?

229
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,248
A job?

230
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,335
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.

231
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,791
There you go.

232
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:21,815
http://hiqve.com/

233
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,715
Thoughtpd...

235
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,343
- Well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

236
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,304
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.

237
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,641
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

238
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,643
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

239
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,857
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

240
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,360
She's a beauty. Look at her.

241
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,739
Hey, thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

242
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:55,995
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

243
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,960
Listen, believe me, this is...

244
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,755
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

245
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,092
I'm sorry, I just can't.

246
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,930
Is that right?

247
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,271
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

248
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,025
Glaring.

249
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,193
Okay.

250
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,491
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

251
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,042
Keller.

252
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:49,423
Again. Oh, god, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

253
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,217
Revenue with no backup.

254
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:57,306
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

255
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,695
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

256
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:16,325
How about if I just push 28,800...

257
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:22,039
Out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

258
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:32,883
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

259
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,968
Fair enough.

260
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,012
I'll take care of it.

261
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,264
Thank you for the heads-up.

262
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,476
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

263
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,688
What if your kids found out?

264
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:55,364
- If my kids found out?
- This. What you're doing.

265
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,077
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

266
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,917
Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

267
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,879
I guess maybe I'd...

268
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,008
I'd say that I might have feet of Clay...

269
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,636
But that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

270
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,390
You know, trying to provide.

271
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,311
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand...

272
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,276
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

273
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,612
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, so...

274
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,782
I'd better get back to it.

275
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,668
Oh, god.

276
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,213
Hi, Walt.

277
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,050
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...

278
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,719
What?

279
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,805
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

280
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,056
No, no, no, of course.

281
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,767
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

282
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,605
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.

283
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,983
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

284
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,653
I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to beneke now.

285
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,156
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?

286
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,702
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

287
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,871
Okay, bye.

288
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,332
Why are you doing this?

289
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:33,754
She's just trying to keep me from
seeing you and you're helping her.

290
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:40,469
Well, son, I mean, your mother,
she has her reasons.

291
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,638
What reasons?

292
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,850
Theyte_"

293
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,811
Well, they're...

294
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,691
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

295
00:28:54,858 --> 00:29:01,073
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

296
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,534
Butshe"_

297
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,795
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

298
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:19,758
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

299
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,221
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

300
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,181
Uncle Hank, aunt Marie...

301
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,269
Everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

302
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,189
Everybody is on your side.

303
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:42,864
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

304
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,743
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.

305
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,248
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?

306
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,627
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

307
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,798
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

308
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:04,094
You and your sister will
come first always.

309
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,723
Come on.

310
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:16,064
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

311
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,443
Let's just buck up.

312
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,946
And I'll take you home.

313
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,705
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

314
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,600
Hello. Good afternoon.

315
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,227
- Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.

316
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,065
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

317
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,442
Better call Saul!

318
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,570
I get it all the time.

319
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,241
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 margo.

320
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,828
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

321
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,748
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

322
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,543
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

323
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,253
However, for our purposes...

324
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,799
You might just as well visualize
a large bag of money.

325
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:28,261
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

326
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,223
- Cash?
- Cash. I know, in this economy.

327
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,226
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

328
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,729
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

329
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,440
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

330
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,736
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarized...

331
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,738
We can take care of this right now.

332
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,783
In fact, I could wire you your money
this very afternoon.

333
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,578
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

334
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,789
The price.

335
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,546
We feel 875 is very fair.

336
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,007
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

337
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:12,264
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

338
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,226
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

339
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,437
No, that's my offer.

340
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,856
That's less than half-price.

341
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,108
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

342
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,068
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

343
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,321
And you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

344
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,158
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

345
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,659
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.

346
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,287
How could you possibly imagine
we'd entertain this?

347
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,830
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.

348
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,333
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

349
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,043
That used to be in the basement.

350
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,297
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

351
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,924
And I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

352
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,386
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

353
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,971
But no meth lab.

354
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:58,685
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

355
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:04,232
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

356
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,693
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

357
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,570
I mean, good try...

358
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,073
At sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

359
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,869
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

360
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:21,500
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

361
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,919
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

362
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,214
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

363
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,884
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?

364
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,782
There you go, son.

365
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,578
Come on. It's not devil's island.

366
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,169
Okay.

367
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,524
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

368
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:33,280
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

369
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,701
Hi, honey.

370
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,331
Sorry.

371
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,920
Skyler.

372
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,010
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

373
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:59,431
I mean, can't we at ieastjust sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

374
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,475
Just hash things out like adults?

375
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,315
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

376
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,401
I thought I made myself very clear.

377
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,324
I got dipping sticks.

378
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,491
You've reached Walt's
temporary number.

379
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,493
Please, leave a message.

380
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,749
When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper...

381
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,961
I saw a pizza on our roof.

382
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,797
Would you know anything about that?

383
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,259
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.

384
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:04,222
Calm down, accept the situation
and keep your distance.

385
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:09,102
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.

386
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,404
Skyler. Skyler.

387
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,534
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!

388
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,301
Breaking even is not so bad.

389
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,554
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

390
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:50,602
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to space camp.

391
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,855
Oh, no.

392
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,692
Oh, god. This is all we need.

393
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,989
Hey, mom, dad. How's it going?

394
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,243
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

395
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,912
Come on.

396
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,040
Jesse, the house has been sold.

397
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,209
The new owners are expected
at any moment.

398
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,878
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

399
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,799
I bought the place.

400
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,023
Be back by seven, okay?

401
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,025
Love you.

402
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,936
Oh, god.

403
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,634
It's me. There's something
he should know about.

404
00:43:56,658 --> 00:43:58,658
