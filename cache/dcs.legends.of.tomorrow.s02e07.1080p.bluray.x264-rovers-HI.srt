Then it was meta-humans,
and I can handle that.

Now, I learned
that there are multiple arsenals

I don't get unnerved.

I push back.

Right or wrong,
it is who I am and it is what I do.

This is how you thank us?

You don't understand.
The reason the xenomorphs are here...

319
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,021
is because they have a beef
with the meta-humans.

320
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,777
Tell us something we don't know.

321
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,109
Like, what exactly have we done to them?

322
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,898
Nothing yet.

323
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,201
But they see individuals
with powers such as yours

324
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,953
as a future threat.

325
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,534
And, frankly, so do I.

doesn't mean we have to be.

Yeah, but it's damaged.

The creature's nervous system
is not unlike our own,

- What is that?

Where'd you get that?

Then, why don't you call them off?

368
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,964
We know you sent them packing
once before back in 1951.

That was just a reconnaissance mission.

370

What brought them back?

371
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,672
You did, Mr. Allen.

He knows who you are.

If they're that threatened by meta-humans,

408
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,508
it's hard to believe
they'd be satisfied with just one.

Well, Oliver's trying
to talk him out of it.

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,519
And if he does, what's the collateral
damage of the meta-bomb?

412
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,848

Well, what've we got to lose?

417
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,151
Look, maybe we should contact them.

00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,816
And make it fast.

419
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,525

- Dominator ships are coming in worldwide.
- Including Central City.

421
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,712
Yeah, but they're not moving or anything,

- they're just sitting there.
- For now.

They're trying to leverage us

425
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,466
Contact the Dominators.

426
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,978
Looks like your friend's
not calling you back.

427
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,355
- No, he's not, but I got a plan B.
- Go.

428
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,141
If this came from their drop ship,

429
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,479
and the drop ship came
from the mother ship,

430
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,269
theoretically, I could use it
to vibe us up there.

431
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,525
And if you can't?

432
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,533
Then, I'd be vibing us into the cold,
unforgiving vacuum of space.

433
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,740
- So, let's not do that.
- Yeah, let's not. Okay.

434
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,300
What an unusual gift.

435
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,803
You appear to be a meta-human as well.

436
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,635
Yeah, well,
I figured you'd cut me some slack

437
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,391
seeing as how we saved you back in 1951.

438
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,767
Remember that?

439
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,396

The threat of your kind

What if in using our powers
to make the world better,

we actually end up destroying it?

Yeah, so did we.

I only ended up making them worse.

632
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:28,877
Cheers.

633
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,762
It's like looking into a mirror.

634
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,930
Hey, you know what's funny?

635
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,312
She really kind of looks like my cousin.

636
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,062
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Hey.

637
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,851
Either of you ever saved the world before?

638
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,066
Mmm-hmm. Last year.

639
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,571
- Oh, it doesn't get old, does it?
- No.

640
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,448
It sure beats screwing up the world.

641
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,405
Hey, you are too hard on yourself.

642
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,819
That's what people usually tell me.

643
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,158
And for good reason I'm sure, but...

644
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,741
Back on my Earth,
it's just me and my cousin.

645
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,453
Between the two of us,
we're more powerful than...

646
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,496
- Yeah, everybody in this room combined.
- No, no.

647
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,256
That's the point.

648
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,588
That's what you've all proven here.

649
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,595
Meta-human or not, superpowers or not,

650
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,932
you are Earth's mightiest heroes.

651
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,058
Um...

652
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,262
I owe you an apology.

653
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,524
Keeping you at arm's length
was the wrong move and, uh...

654
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,526
Well, the truth is that this Earth
could probably use a Supergirl.

655
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,863
Well, that's funny.

656
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,650
Because I was just thinking
my Earth could use an Oliver Queen.

657
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,618
I know you said you don't get unnerved.

658
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,283
- (SIGHS)
- But if you did,

659
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,377
I think hardship
is what makes us stronger.

660
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,794
That's probably why these people
look to you as their rock.

661
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,047
You guys feeling the group hug?

662
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,806
- No.
- Come on, come on.

663
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,387
- Okay.
- All right.

664
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,516
Hey, Kara,

665
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,649
- I made you something. Yeah.
- What? Cisco.

666
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,067
What, uh...

667
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,316
What is it?

668
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,025
Oh. (LAUGHS) It's, uh...

669
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,816
- It's an inter-dimensional extrapolator.
- Oh. Uh...

670
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,368
It creates small breaches,
so you can use it

671
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,825
to cross over to our universe
anytime you need to.

672
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,912
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God. That's amazing.

673
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,497
I also included
communication functionality,

674
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,504
so if you ever need any help
you can always contact the team.

675
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,169
RORY: Hey, skirt.

676
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,001
Call me.

677
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,060
(SIGHS) All right, Grey. Spill.

678
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,690
How is it you have a kid?

679
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,401
I didn't think I had to explain
such matters to you, Jefferson.

680
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,732
Come on, you know what I mean.

681
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,279
When we traveled back to 1987,

682
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:03,449
I gave my younger self a lecture
about neglecting Clarissa and he...

683
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,869
And he followed your advice
all the way to pound town.

684
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,704
Wait.

685
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,794
You created an Aberration.

686
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,924
Which is why you cannot tell the team.

687
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,711
If you don't want me to tell the team,
that means you...

688
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,309
I do not want to lose my daughter.

689
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,777
Something tells me
you weren't invited here.

690
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,108
Dr. Heywood.

691
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,113
Don't Dr. Heywood me.
What the hell are you doing here?

692
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,151
I like parties.
And I'm here for the mop up.

693
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,161
Cover up. But you can't cover this up.

694
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,913
- (LAUGHS)
- Agent Smith.

695
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,665
It's so funny seeing you here.

696
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,078
I was just having the loveliest chat
with your President about you.

697
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,496
I was telling her on my Earth,

698
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,915
we have a Department
of Extra-Normal Operations

699
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,630
which deals specifically with aliens.

700
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,635
She thought it was an excellent idea.

701
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,757
She also loved my pitch about
reassigning you to Antarctica.

702
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,109
Maybe next time, you're a little nicer
to strange visitors from another planet.

703
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,354
<i>Pack a jacket.</i>

704
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,199
BARRY: You ready to see
if Cisco's gadget works?

705
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,441
KARA: Ready.

706
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,030
And remember,

707
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,161
if you guys ever need me,
I'm just a call away.

708
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
Same here.

709
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,036
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

710
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,717
It's weird to think that
all of this started with the two of us.

711
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,552
Ever think about what it would be like
if we never got on that boat?

712
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,971
I don't know if I have to think about it.

713
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,065
I mean, maybe the Dominators showed us
what our lives would have been like.

714
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,319
I know it was a prison, but in a way...

715
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,900
In a way, it was a gift.

716
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,951
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

717
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,505
DIGGLE: There she goes.

718
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,713
Off to her spaceship,
time traveling as if it's totally normal.

719
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,962
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)
John, it's like you said.

720
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,756
Normal sort of went out the window
when this one arrived.

721
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,100
I may never understand you, man, but...

722
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,263
You're one of the best men I know.

723
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,061
Thanks, Digg.

724
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,941
So, will you forgive me for what I did?

725
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,240
Barry, it's like I keep telling this guy,
you have to forgive yourself.

726
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,868
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

727
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,495
Yeah, thanks.

728
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,491
Well. We ought to do this more often.

729
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,875
Get together, I mean.

730
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,870
I don't know if the world could take it.

731
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,289
I meant, like,
without the world being threatened.

732
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,881
If the world wasn't being threatened,
what would we do?

733
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,013
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

734
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,223
I'm just saying that
next time I'm gonna get you.

735
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,637
I'm just saying I've beaten you twice.

736
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,180
The first time was a tie.

737
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,472
And the second time?

738
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,775
- There were no witnesses the second time.
- (CHUCKLING)

739
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,358
Super speed and arrow tools.

740
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,898
Our lives aren't exactly normal.

741
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,493
I told Kara that I was looking
to reclaim some normal.

742
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,282
Thinking on it now, I'm not so sure.

743
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,285
I know what you mean.

744
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,497
We both got a look
at what life would look like normal.

745
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,549
It would've been happy.

746
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,634
But not full.

747
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,384
No. No, nowhere close.

748
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,220
To things not being normal.

749
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,095
To life being full.
