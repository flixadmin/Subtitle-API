1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,140
Nikolai. William's brother.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,860
She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,840
If you really want to meet my brother,
I'll introduce you to him.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,260
<i>I[ know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's 
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.]</i>

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,100
They were after William,
but he wasn't there.
<i>I[ know I promised you'd meet Nikolai, but he's 
back in Stockholm. You'll meet him before summer.]</i>

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,500
They were after William,
but he wasn't there.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,480
What's going on?

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,180
Just stay here.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,900
It's the Yakuza guys.

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,360
What's up with your phone?

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,900
Yeah, sorry.
My battery is fucked.

12
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,160
Stroll?

13
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,960
A little stroll.

14
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,740
Do I get a kiss?

15
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
How long are we gonna stroll?

16
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,200
Can't we just stop and argue
now? Be done with it.

17
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,720
I don't want to argue.

18
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,780
Yes, you do.

19
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,740
You'll say something like:

20
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,280
You have to stop fighting, William.
Then I'll say:

21
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,540
I didn't mean for you to see that.
You'll say: But I did see it.

22
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
I want you to stop.
Me: Fine, I'll stop.

23
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,580
You'll say: Great.
I'll say: Good.

24
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,400
And then we're done with it. Hm?

25
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,800
William.. You smashed a bottle
on a guy's head.

26
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,400
In self defense? Yes.

27
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,540
You could have killed him!

28
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,740
Don't you understand how 
serious it is?

29
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,580
What's serious is that Yakuza
beats up innocent people.

30
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,740
Someone had to do something.

31
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,520
Someone didn't have to do anything!
You could've talked to him!

32
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,800
Or contacted the police, or I don't know!
Certainly don't respond with violence.

33
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,740
Wow you're naive.

34
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,180
I'm naive?! Because I don't
think violence solves anything?

35
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,540
Noora, violence solves things every day.

36
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,460
The world is driven
by violence and war.

37
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,120
How do you think Norway became 
such a free and democratic country?

38
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,460
They had a nice chat with
coffee and cake?

39
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,580
No. There are people who 
fought for it. With violence.

40
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,660
How did we defend ourselves
if someone tried to take our freedom?

41
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,720
We solved it with violence.

42
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,540
I can't eh..

43
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,980
I can't be together with a guy who..

44
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,680
.. who smashes bottles on
other people's heads.

45
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,620
Don't do this, Noora.

46
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,100
Yeah but I need a little space.
To think through all this stuff here.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,660
I can't think properly
when I'm with you.

48
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,940
Everything just becomes messy in my head.

49
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,060
Okay.

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,480
Bit of space.

51
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Slut, slut, slut...

52
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,900
On every picture.

53
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,020
Who commented that?
-allah9753

54
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,420
This weekend?
-After she posted the bus picture.

55
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,900
Is it just because she went to the bus?
-It's not because she was being so slutty.

56
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,320
You were acting like a real nun while
the Riot guys worked for dear life.

57
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,580
Fucking hell, when one of the Riot
guys came over to Sana and said:

58
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,760
"Wanna join me in the back of
the bus and sit on my face?"

59
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,800
So Sana said: "Why should I?
Is your nose bigger than your dick?"

60
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,180
Are you kidding? 
You said that? To who?

61
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,240
I have no idea. A sexist asshole
who doesn't take no for an answer.

62
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,160
Vilde, you hooked up a little.

63
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,060
The one time we're on the bus,
a random fight pops up.

64
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,860
But it wasn't random.

65
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,300
It was planned that 
they were going to meet.

66
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,520
Isak contacted the Penetrators after
Jonas was beat up by Yakuza.

67
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,860
While we were out partying,
Isak called Chris.

68
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:23,100
Why did it have to happen the
one time we were on the bus with them?

69
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,380
What happened with him that 
he got a wine bottle on his head?

70
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,420
I heard someone filmed 
it while it happened.

71
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,500
If they report it,
William is screwed.

72
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,520
It's extreme violence.
That's a prison sentence.

73
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,860
Hey girl.
Hello.

74
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,640
What are you doing?

75
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,880
I'm just writing.. or I'm trying to
write an article for Norwegian.

76
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,900
But you can't concentrate on
it because you're only thinking about William?

77
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,020
You.. What's the deal?

78
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,360
The deal is that..
I'm really in love with William.

79
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,880
Like.. insanely.

80
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,680
Seriously in love.

81
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,580
Don't you ever want to..

82
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,360
..just drink until you're really drunk,
or hook up with people?

83
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,500
Sure.

84
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,560
What makes you not do it then?

85
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,820
My faith is stronger than lust.

86
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
It feels much more important
to me than hooking up and drinking.

87
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,480
That's exactly it.

88
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,460
There's nothing that feels more important
to me than to be together with William.

89
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,700
Even though I know there should be.

90
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
So why aren't you together with him?

91
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,000
Because he's a bad person.

92
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,500
Why is he a bad person?

93
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,780
First off, he's very controlling.

94
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,880
How?

95
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:15,860
He tells me what I should feel,
and what to say. What I should do.

96
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,400
And you don't dare 
to contradict him?

97
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,680
No, I do. I dare to
contradict him.

98
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,900
But he gets angry
when you disagree with him?

99
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,080
No, he doesn't get angry.

100
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:48,780
But he argues in such a way that
I can't contradict him.

101
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,080
So.. What's the problem?
That he's smarter than you, or?

102
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,660
He tries to change my opinion.

103
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,240
But your opinions only change
when you think he's right.

104
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah, but I'm just trying
to be strong and independent. 

105
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:31,180
I can't.. Should I change all my
opinion for a guy, then?

106
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,900
You are strong and independent when you can 
change your opinions. No matter what gender changes you.

107
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,820
There's nothing wrong with him
challenging the way you think.

108
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,840
If you are not afraid
to say what you mean..

109
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
.. then you don't have to be 
worried about him controlling you.

110
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:18,880
But he's violent. He smashed
a bottle on someone's head.

111
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,160
Yeah, okay.

112
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,820
But why did he do it?

113
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:40,840
Because he has these damn ideas that 
the world is driven by war and violence.

114
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,760
We are completely different.

115
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,300
I am against war.

116
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,100
That's not why
he smashed the bottle.

117
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,180
He smashed the bottle because he
was angry and scared. Why was that?

118
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
I don't know.

119
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,300
You didn't ask him?

120
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,540
No..

121
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,060
Okay. I think it's interesting that
you're saying you're against war.

122
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,540
War doesn't start with violence.
It starts with misunderstandings and prejudice.

123
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah, so what?

124
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,260
If you say you're
in favor of a world full of peace..

125
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,420
.. you have to try to understand why
others think and act the way they do.

126
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,380
You have to accept that not everyone
sees the world the way you do.

127
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,300
You can't just believe that everyone has
 the answers to what is right and wrong.

128
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,340
If you haven't even made an attempt
to understand the one you love..

129
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
.. then I'll be pessimistic
on behalf of the whole world.

130
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:44,000
You don't have to be with him, but you can't decide
it without even trying to understand him.

131
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,880
Then there's Vilde..

132
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,680
Ah, Vilde.

133
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm really scared that
she'll be devastated.

134
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,220
You're underestimating Vilde. She's
the coolest of us all.

135
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,280
She's actually the first one
I would take to war with me.

136
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,400
Just tell her. She'll manage.

137
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,660
And she knows.
That William isn't hers.

138
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,040
Deep down.

139
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,740
Deep down, indeed.

140
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:08,920
Deep, deep, really deep down.
In the inner cells of her body, there's an atom.

141
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,060
In that atom, there is a proton.

142
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,020
In that proton, there's a small sealed box.

143
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,120
Inside that sealed box, there's another box.

144
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,980
And inside that box, that's where she knows.

145
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,140
Good luck.

146
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,620
But completely serious now, Noora..

147
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,220
If nothing feels more important to
you than being with William..

148
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
You have to try to make it work.

149
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,320
It's not certain it'll go well.
It may as well go to hell.

150
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,980
But that's life!

151
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,980
It's impossible to know for sure.

152
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,300
Unless you have a magic
hijab like me. Then you know.

153
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,260
What does your magic hijab 
say about me and William?

154
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
It says inshallah.

155
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,340
What does it mean?
Is it good or bad?

156
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,740
Impossible to say.
Could go either way.

157
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
Okay.

158
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,120
Who would have thought?
Sana has a soft side.

159
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,140
If you fucking tell someone..

160
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,840
Hey Vilde.

161
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,720
Noora? Hi.

162
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,740
What are you doing here?

163
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,340
I have to talk to you.

164
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,780
Coffee?

165
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,560
Thanks.

166
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,620
I'm in love with William.

167
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,100
And he's in love with you?

168
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,420
I think so.

169
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,480
What are you thinking?

170
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,620
A bit relieved, maybe?

171
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,160
Oh?

172
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,620
I thought about why I was 
so obsessed with William.

173
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,820
I knew he was just a fuckboy.

174
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,640
I thought I could use him 
to just be done with the first time.

175
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,540
But then when we were together,
he wasn't a fuckboy.

176
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,980
He was good, nice, and kind.

177
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
That meant something.

178
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,600
It got me thinking that maybe
it meant something for him as well.

179
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,040
Of course I understand that it didn't..

180
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,760
.. when he said I wasn't good enough.

181
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
That's when I was done with him.

182
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:44,180
It only confirmed that he
never felt something for me.

183
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,280
But then he apologised, and there he was again.
He sent messages and invited us to parties.

184
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,460
That's when I was unsure.

185
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,900
I think it was the uncertainty
that just made me completely..

186
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,540
Crazy.

187
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,700
But now..

188
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,620
Now that you say you're in love..

189
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,160
I don't have to
wonder what he's feeling.

190
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,360
And that's a relief.
If you get what I mean.

191
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,000
Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

192
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:31,060
All those times you said William was a
selfish asshole that wasn't good enough for me.

193
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,080
Do you think he's good enough for you?

194
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
I don't know.

195
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,620
Anyway, I'm really glad
that you told me.

196
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,060
Thanks.

197
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,780
No, of course..

198
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,560
It's not "of course".

199
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,820
You could have tried to kept it a secret.


200
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,360
Pretended there was nothing. Dragged
it out, let me sit there and talk about William..

201
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,680
.. and look stupid. While you actually
knew he had feelings for you.

202
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,680
But I did keep
it a secret from you.

203
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,180
I know that.

204
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,100
I was just testing you.

205
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,960
You knew?

206
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,860
Yeah. I've known it for a while.

207
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,260
But I'm gonna continue
working out.

208
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,840
Do you think this body becomes
like this by itself? Huh? No!

209
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,820
It's hard work. This here are squats,
every two days. Every morning at 7.

210
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:43,300
I'll be done in half an hour. Do you
want to eat lunch at the coffee place?

211
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,060
Hi.

212
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
Noora, wasn't it?

213
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,460
Eh, yeah.

214
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,180
Hi.

215
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,900
Is William at home?

216
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,120
Sorry.

217
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Okay. But do you know where he is?

218
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,060
Yeah, where is he?
Training, maybe?

219
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,100
Did you try to call him?
-Yeah, but my phone runs out of power all the time.

220
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,620
I can try to call him for you.

221
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,760
Eh, yeah.

222
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,060
Or do you have a charger?
A phone charger?

223
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,360
Yeah, yeah!

224
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,460
This is Noora. She'll just
borrow a phone charger.

225
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,380
Do you want some wine?
-No thanks.

226
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,940
Something else to drink?

227
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm fine.

228
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,400
I actually thought
you were in Stockholm?

229
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,760
Okay.. Why?

230
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,820
Because William said so?

231
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,020
William, William..

232
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,840
William isn't very fond
of mixing friends and family, you see.

233
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,440
He's not answering?

234
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,220
Eh, no.

235
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,080
We're in a fight, so..

236
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,820
I can send him a message to hear
when he's coming home, if you want to?

237
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,160
Eh, yeah. Maybe.
If you want to.

238
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,780
Who's the girl with blonde
hair sitting at the end?

239
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,180
Eh, Mari.

240
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,420
I think she goes to my school.

241
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,200
Yeah, she goes to Nissen.

242
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,700
Did you get a reply?

243
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,540
William's not coming home..

244
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,580
.. tonight.

245
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,620
Where is he, then?

246
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,320
Noora, you..
seem like an incredibly nice girl.

247
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,700
And I'm really happy for William.

248
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
He's my little brother.

249
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,180
There's nothing I want more than
for him to have a girl like you.

250
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,460
It's just that William
is.. complicated.

251
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Complicated?

252
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,900
He used to have
these insane tantrums.

253
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,740
He would hit, or bite. Kick.

254
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,940
He once threatened to push
our little sister out the window.

255
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,140
Mom sometimes had to lock him inside of a room.
She was so scared of what he could do.

256
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,660
He's stopped biting, though

257
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,020
William has always 
done as he pleases.

258
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
He's good at manipulating
to get what he wants.

259
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,600
When he doesn't get what he wants,
he becomes extremely destructive.

260
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,740
He doesn't really
care about other people.

261
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,660
If you were wondering why he didn't
want us to meet. This is why.

262
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,540
He's really scared
of being found out.

263
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,260
Perhaps I'm a bad brother
for telling you this but..

264
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,660
I've seen enough good 
women like you come and go.

265
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,800
There are girls who believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better to them.

266
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,180
I don't know..

267
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,280
You're standing here. Waiting.

268
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,060
While he's out there somewhere
and sleeping with someone else.
