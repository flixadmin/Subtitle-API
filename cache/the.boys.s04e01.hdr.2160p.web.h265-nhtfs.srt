a resync

33
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,645
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

34
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,689
- Homelander's gonna love this.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

35
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:27,611
{\an8}Homelander has agreed to donate
to the Starlight House, which is...

36
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,947
{\an8}- No. No.
- I mean, giv... Come on, give it up.

37
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,867
{\an8}- Give it up for this guy.
- No, no, no.

38
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,119
<i>I'm not just like the rest of you,</i>

39
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,370
I'm better.

40
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,373
- Homelander is a fucking psychopath.
- Homelander is protecting them.

41
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,419
You said you'd always looked out for me.
You promised!

42
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,130
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you.
- I hate you.

43
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,132
This little guy here is my son.

44
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,508
Fuck you, fascist!

45
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,849
You help me out with one small favor,

46
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,434
<i>and I'll help you.</i>

47
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,979
- Do you have it or not?
- Original recipe, all 11 herbs and spices.

48
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,542
Just a pinch.

49
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,817
{\an8}<i>My name is Annie January,
and I fucking quit.</i>

50
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,195
I say you're one of the Boys.

51
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,614
You are like rabid little doggy,

52
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,116
but loyal to whoever holds this chain.

53
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,117
Your brain's leaking.

54
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:17,369
<i>Temp V is gonna kill you both.</i>

55
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,456
- How long I got?
<i>- Months. 12 on the outside.</i>

56
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,749
Homelander needs to die.

57
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,459
<i>That's it. Whatever it takes.</i>

58
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,711
Soldier Boy's our weapon.
He's how we kill Homelander.

59
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,712
Did you know?

60
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,631
<i>That Soldier Boy was my father?</i>

61
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,487
Get out of the building, now.

62
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,137
Butcher, stop!

63
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,682
The thing you wanted, he's right
fucking there, and now you blink?

64
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:39,600
I made a promise.

65
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>You don't need me anymore.</i>

66
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,269
I could jump.

67
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>You can fucking fly.</i>

68
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,562
Good evening!

69
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,564
Now, look, I know it's a late night,

70
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,401
so I just wanted to come out
and say thanks for your patience.

71
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,153
The bar remains open, and, uh...

72
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,448
Oh, yeah, Colorado and Nevada
just went to Robert Singer!

73
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,702
Whoo!

74
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,666
So, stay tuned.

75
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,503
I feel like we're gonna be back very soon
with some very good news.

76
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,464
Thank you, and God bless America!

77
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,853
Motherfucking GruyÃ¨re puffs?

78
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,438
What am I supposed to do with these?

79
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,733
She says you've been working too hard.
You need to eat more.

80
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,736
We pull this off, I promise
I'll grub all these motherfuckers.

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,789
Hughie, come on. I need eyes.

82
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,393
<i>Yeah, yeah,
just give me one... more second.</i>

83
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,837
Sorry, sorry. There's, like, a million
connectors in here, and I can't see shit.

84
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,175
Are you helping,
or you just showing off?

85
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,511
Oh, for sure both.

86
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,347
<i>Is that it?</i>

87
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,808
All right, live and in living color.

88
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,645
Butcher, you copy?

89
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,357
Where the fuck is Butcher?

90
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,205
Oh, don't you fucking start. I'm fine.

91
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,290
<i>Charcuter.</i>

92
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,834
Who are you talking to?

93
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,086
I ain't said a word.

94
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,758
Geez.

95
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,429
All right.
Come on, then.

96
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,565
Evening, cunts.

97
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,651
We're here to commit
a bit of high treason.

98
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,867
<i>Going up.</i>

99
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,964
Hey, whoa, hey.

100
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,092
The plan is you wait here,
cover our exit, no?

101
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,761
<i>Oh, come off it. Watch a fucking door?</i>

102
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,639
Kimiko, if Butcher steps one foot
in that elevator, break his arm.

103
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,730
<i>Please
remove obstruction from doors.</i>

104
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,361
Fuck me.

105
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,955
Okay, big man, let's do this.

106
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,707
There's a lot of people in there.

107
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,546
Come on, kiddo.

108
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,591
Would you be scared
of a bunch of cockroaches? Huh?

109
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,468
Yeah.

110
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,513
Yeah.
Then baby chicks or whatever.

111
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,683
Look, the-the point is,
you have nothing to be nervous about.

112
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,019
Come on. We've talked about this.

113
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,313
They're only humans and...?

114
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,066
Toys for our amusement.

115
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,692
- That's right.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,069
We got this.

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,459
Hold up, hold up.

118
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,211
Okay, we got a problem.

119
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,798
W-Wait, what is... he doing here?

120
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,442
<i>Homelander's
in the building.</i>

121
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>If you see him, do not engage. I repeat,</i>

122
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,054
do not engage with Homelander.

123
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,931
<i>That means you, Butcher, you copy?</i>

124
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,891
My goodness,
you look beautiful this evening.

125
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,353
Especially you. Zoe, uh,
y-you remember my son, Ryan?

126
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,689
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,817
Hey, Zo, you know what? I heard that
this hotel makes its own ice cream.

128
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,944
Why don't you take Ryan
and try and find some, huh?

129
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,905
What a great idea. Go for it, sport.

130
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,032
Just nobody come back pregnant.

131
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,119
Just kidding.

132
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,164
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
They're too young. Although,

133
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,683
Ryan could spew goo if he wanted to.

134
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,542
What the fuck are you doing here?

135
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,752
Oh, I've supported
every new administration

136
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,671
for the past... 16 years.

137
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,924
I don't want your support.
You're on trial for fucking murder.

138
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,676
- Hi, Doug.
- One,

139
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,597
that's a formality, and two,
that's a clear-cut case of self-defense.

140
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,766
That thug threw a projectile at my son.

141
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,351
It was a plastic bottle.

142
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,895
Could've had anthrax in it.

143
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,498
Not that that would've hurt us,
but there was a principle at stake.

144
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:05,110
And, besides, when I took
that monster down, people applauded.

145
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,695
Your shareholders didn't.

146
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,532
Well, that's why
you and me are gonna prove to them

147
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,118
that even with a "soft on crime"
fucking libtard

148
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,578
- for a president...
- Mm.

149
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,915
...it's gonna be
business as usual at Vought.

150
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,501
Any transaction you and I may
or may not have had is ancient history.

151
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,345
Well, then let's make some new history.

152
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,013
Ladies and gentlemen, Victoria Neuman.

153
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,157
Let's give her a round.

154
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,892
Huh?

155
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,770
Girls get it done in the White House.

156
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,106
Hmm? God bless you.

157
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,541
Give us a minute here, would you, love?

158
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,558
Listen, Ryan, I've got a lot to say...

159
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,352
and fuck all time to say it.

160
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,021
I got a lorry out back.
I can get you out of here.

161
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,209
- What are you talking about?
- I know you're angry at me, and you've got every right to be.

162
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,652
But you know how dangerous Homelander is.

163
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,404
- He's my dad.
- Right.

164
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,382
H-He murdered some poor sod
right in front of your eyes.

165
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,533
- That guy was a pedophile.
- It ain't true.

166
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,826
He-He's lying to you.

167
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,328
Let me take you to Grace, all right?

168
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,664
A-And then you
don't got to see me no more.

169
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,586
Please, I'm... I'm begging you.

170
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,630
It's what your mom would want.

171
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,050
No means no, William.

172
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,814
This isn't the Neverland Ranch.

173
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,806
Don't worry.
Nothing bad's gonna happen, right?

174
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,934
Oh.

175
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,062
Seems it already has.

176
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,985
Look at that big black mass
curdling around your brain.

177
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,865
What do you got, six months?

178
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,326
Less?

179
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,872
That's too bad. W-We're not gonna have
that last dance together.

180
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,874
I'll miss us.

181
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,918
Bloody hell.

182
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,712
You wank to your own voice, don't you?

183
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,674
That's the spirit, champ.

184
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,468
Son.

185
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,482
Come on. I do not want to
miss Smash Mouth.

186
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,546
So many pantsuits.

187
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,315
Mom?

188
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,587
What are you doing in here?

189
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,446
Apologies, Miss Neuman,

190
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,840
<i>we're with your mother's detail.</i>

191
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,366
Is that Zoe?

192
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,618
We'll be done in just a minute.

193
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,123
Why don't you wait outside.

194
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,607
- Frenchie, what's happening?
<i>- She's a fucking Supe.</i>

195
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,258
She's a fucking Supe!

196
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,846
Yeah, I guess I'll just, uh...

197
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,099
...wait here.

198
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,230
It's okay.

199
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,565
We see nothing.

200
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,235
<i>Ãa va? Non Ã§a va?</i>

201
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,002
We need an exit, now!

202
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,176
There's a window
on the south end of the hallway.

203
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,016
Uh... We're eight stories up.

204
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,392
<i>Frenchie, trust me.</i>

205
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,841
- No!
- Frenchie!

206
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,511
Motherfucker.

207
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,650
Yes.

208
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,943
- Oh, shit.
<i>- Oh, mon Dieu.</i>

209
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,444
Oh, God.

210
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,780
Oh, gross.

211
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,753
Thank Christ. Can we go now? Jesus.

212
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,297
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

213
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,025
You got to teach Butcher
the meaning of the word "covert."

214
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,360
He just got made by a 12-year-old.

215
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,344
You mean Zoe, who just murdered two guys?

216
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,223
Vic, you-you shot your own daughter up
with V? How could you do that to her?

217
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,225
- I needed to keep her safe.
- Safe?

218
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,354
You turned her into a fucking monster.
Like you.

219
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,898
I'm sorry. That sounds like
the pot calling the kettle

220
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,650
a teleporting dude with his dick out.

221
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,777
Worst mistake I ever made.

222
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,407
Vic, you and me, we were...

223
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,160
We were like family. I mean...

224
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,372
was everything just... bullshit?

225
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,001
I almost told you once.

226
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,962
That night of the blackout, you remember?

227
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,882
You brought every bodega snack
you could carry for Zoe.

228
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,219
We played Uno with her for hours
until the lights came back on.

229
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,388
And I thought...

230
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,434
...you were one of my closest friends.

231
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,312
I mean, hell, you're dating a Supe.

232
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,273
If anyone would understand,
it'd be you, right?

233
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,441
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,568
I was scared.

235
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,236
Scared you'd have to pop my head.

236
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,113
I was scared to lose you.

237
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,370
I always cared about you, Hughie.

238
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,248
That part was real.

239
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,003
Hey, Vicky.

240
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,006
- Fuck you!
- Oh!

241
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,222
Seriously? Ugh.

242
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,476
I have to be on TV in, like,
ten minutes, you fucking asshole.

243
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,038
We're gonna out you. We're gonna go to
the press, tell them you blew up Congress.

244
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,581
I still, I still got the Red River files.

245
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,405
Okay, okay, okay.
Have you ever seen <i>WarGames?</i>

246
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,835
What am I saying, look at you,
of course you've seen fucking <i>WarGames.</i>

247
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,403
- We're making jokes?
- Mutually assured destruction.

248
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,989
I hurt you, you out me. You out me,

249
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,033
I kill everyone you've ever loved.

250
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,661
The only thing that makes sense
is a truce.

251
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,414
Or plan B.

252
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,085
Jesus fucking...

253
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,075
How is it you guys are actually
getting worse at your jobs?

254
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,473
Mm. They just called Arizona.

255
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,143
Guess I better go change.

256
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,043
Nice of you to show up.
Where the hell you been?

257
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,838
The bog. Trying to wash off
the stench of failure

258
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,172
from your cock-up last night.

259
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,966
Shut the fuck up, Butcher.

260
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,222
Grace.

261
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,851
- Not you.
- Oh, come off it.

262
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,520
I washed my bollocks and all.

263
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,188
- M?
- There are people who,

264
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,524
because of ignorance or maybe insanity,

265
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,694
still believe you have
something to contribute.

266
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm not one of them.

267
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,865
I'll get the kid back, Grace.

268
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,742
I'll make it right.

269
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:23,543
Two agents from my detail are dead
at the hands of a 12-year-old.

270
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:28,214
We had to tell their families they snorted
fentanyl-laced cocaine at the after-party.

271
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,260
- Sir, our intel told us the acid would work on Neuman.
- She's no idiot.

272
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,970
She'll know I was behind it.

273
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,682
Goddamn it! Everyone told me
to pick Buttigieg instead.

274
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,476
You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

275
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,936
I vouched for you.
The CIA is bankrolling you.

276
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,521
All due respect, ma'am,

277
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,833
you can always put Butcher back in charge.
He's right outside.

278
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,817
What about Starlight?

279
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,194
She goes by Annie now.

280
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,780
Can Annie burn out Neuman's
fucking eyes, debilitate her?

281
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,925
If she can get close enough to her without
getting her head popped off, who knows?

282
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,870
But we might have to accept the
possibility that Neuman's... invulnerable.

283
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,581
Congress certifies the election January 6.

284
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,752
After that, a Supe is one heartbeat away
from the presidency.

285
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,712
My fucking heartbeat.

286
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,299
Now, I can only keep my distance
from her for so long.

287
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,468
Eliminating her is top priority.

288
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
So do your fucking job.

289
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,722
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,272
Somewhere else you need to be?

291
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,192
No, sir.

292
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,196
Billy Butcher.

293
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,366
Joe Kessler.

294
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,409
Fuck me. How long's it been?

295
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,246
Uh, I'd say 11 years,
but, officially speaking,

296
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,914
none of that shit show ever happened.

297
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,833
Then how come
I remember you high on opium,

298
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,209
rimming out the General's wife?

299
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,418
Well, fuck you.

300
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,841
Hey, let me buy you a bad cup of coffee.

301
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,052
Demoted from
your own fucking team.

302
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,637
What's your shitty code name again?

303
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,847
The Boys.

304
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,683
Oof. Who came up with that shit?

305
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,228
Why you putting up with it? Walk away.

306
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,273
No, my son, I've got plans and schemes.

307
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,109
I'll be back at the head
of the table in no time.

308
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,111
Well, you better.

309
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,172
You know, a lot of the guys are thinking
you got benched

310
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,490
at the worst possible time.

311
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,201
You know, Mallory's so focused
on killing the VP-Elect

312
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,413
'cause that's what Singer wants,
and half of goddamn Langley's on it.

313
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,541
Well, you know Grace, she's always
been a bit of a political animal.

314
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,376
And what are you focused on?

315
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,753
Homelander.

316
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:35,341
He killed that poor cunt in broad
daylight, and they fucking cheered.

317
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,969
I mean, what you think
that taught him, eh?

318
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,639
No.

319
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,350
We're whistling away
towards a fucking apocalypse,

320
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,895
and Grace's eye ain't on the ball.

321
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,688
You had a clean shot at him, right?

322
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,150
With Soldier Boy? You didn't take it.

323
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,569
Was your eye on the ball?

324
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,658
Why do I get the feeling
we ain't just bumped into each other?

325
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,744
You remember the Panjshir Valley?

326
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,999
Yeah. Pretty hard to forget.

327
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,044
You dragged me out of there
and dropped how many bodies to do it,

328
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,463
without giving it
a second fucking thought.

329
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,840
And yet you still didn't
name your son after me, eh?

330
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:20,720
We need someone like you, Billy.
Right fucking now.

331
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,016
Before the Supes start rounding us up
and dumping us off in camps.

332
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,233
Hey.

333
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,945
A tie? You going to prom?

334
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,034
- What's up?
- Janine.

335
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,912
She got into a fight at school.

336
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,290
Principal didn't say why,
just that she KO'd a boy.

337
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,375
A boy?

338
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,418
Don't you dare be proud right now.

339
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,879
She's been slamming doors, Marvin.

340
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,716
She told me to "eat a dick."

341
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,301
Janine said that?

342
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,471
She's been having a hard time
since Todd moved out.

343
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,740
You mean, since you kicked him out?

344
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,266
Let's dial down the glee
in your voice, but, yes,

345
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,769
since I kicked him out.

346
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,646
But Janine still loves him.

347
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,648
- She's worried.
- Worried about what?

348
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,944
Todd got so deep into
all that weird Hometeamer shit.

349
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,147
He's not answering my calls.
I don't know where he is.

350
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,114
Okay, so...?

351
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,740
And you're good at finding people.

352
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,450
Oh, come on. Monique...

353
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,577
For your daughter, Marvin.

354
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,714
Well, I get what you saw in that guy.
He was good to Janine.

355
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,718
'Cause it sure as shit
wasn't the D.

356
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,055
Right?

357
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,995
<i>- You have to be good.
- You're my greatest failure.</i>

358
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,356
It's your destiny.

359
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,261
<i>It's because deep down
there's a part of you that is still...</i>

360
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,285
human.

361
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,768
Don't get brazen
with me.

362
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,468
You're not to refer to the deceased
as the "victim."

363
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,845
It's a loaded term
and for the jury to decide.

364
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,807
Sir, so I'm afraid we are behind
on the Tower Reconstruction,

365
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,186
but I can 100% assure you
that it is not my fault.

366
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,147
{\an8}<i>But it wasn't until
Annie January stepped out</i>

367
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,982
{\an8} <i>from Vought's shadow, and Homelander's,</i>

368
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,942
{\an8} <i>that we saw the true extent of her power.</i>

369
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,612
{\an8}<i>Vought and Homelander
aren't above the law.</i>

370
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>They can't just do whatever they want.</i>

371
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:49,077
<i>Deep, we got to talk
about the octopus in the room.</i>

372
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,288
<i>Your ex, Cassandra,
wrote a tell-all book...</i>

373
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,849
<i>I'm gonna have to stop you
right there, Hailey.</i>

374
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,793
<i>You know, there were no relations
with an octopus.</i>

375
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:01,005
<i>It's, uh, it's just a racist rumor
and a ridiculous lie</i>

376
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,175
<i>perpetuated by a jilted
and, uh...</i>

377
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,469
<i>emotionally unstable hysterical woman,</i>

378
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,112
<i>who, let's be clear, pooped in my bed.</i>

379
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,848
Deep, please tell me
the fucking octopus is gone.

380
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,768
Yes, Ashley. She's...

381
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,854
It is taken care of. Okay?

382
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,314
Hey, Noir.

383
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,942
Sir,
after that debacle at Godolkin...

384
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,152
thank you again for saving my life...

385
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,796
the board felt we should find
new candidates for The Seven, ASAP.

386
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,116
The selection committee has

387
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,743
narrowed it down to 25 choices.

388
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,581
Um, okay, great.

389
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,918
If we're going purely on socials,
I might suggest Talon out of Redlands.

390
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,547
Pass. She's a butterface.

391
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,633
- Her body's on point, but her face...
- Yeah, I get it.

392
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,885
Thank you so much for explaining.

393
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,470
Chauvinist prick.

394
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,348
Ugh, not that slutty cum rag.

395
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,269
- Hold up, I thought he ate a dog.
- He ate out a dog.

396
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,855
It's a big difference.

397
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,985
Sister Sage? Hell no.

398
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,737
She was with me in Teenage Kix
for, like, barely a year

399
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,632
- before they canned her ass.
- What's her power?

400
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,825
She's the world's
smartest person.

401
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,536
She's not smart enough to know
when to shut her mouth.

402
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,996
Wrangler. Isn't he a...

403
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,749
Texas nutjob. The San Antonio office
had to cover up those migrant murders.

404
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,513
- I kind of like him.
- Of course,

405
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,087
he bumps us with suburban women
and white men over 50.

406
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,964
Amazing choice, sir.

407
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,841
Yeah, I totally agree. He's a mensch.

408
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,235
Did I use that word right? Mensch?

409
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,552
You just said he was crazy.

410
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,315
What I meant was
we would be crazy

411
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,264
to, you know, not bring him in.

412
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,108
I am surrounded by sycophants
and fucking imbeciles.

413
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,295
It's just that you make
a lot of really great points, sir.

414
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,487
Deep, just...

415
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,037
Blow A-Train.

416
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,665
What?

417
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,084
I'm not kidding.
Go over there, pull out

418
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,754
A-Train's cock and blow him.

419
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,970
Okay.

420
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,439
Get up.

421
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,588
Sex is just a spectrum,
right, bro?

422
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,674
Get off your fucking knees.

423
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,968
This is exactly

424
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,011
what I'm talking about. Not one of you

425
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,139
has the stomach
to challenge anything I say.

426
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,308
Oh, my God.

427
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,603
I have got to carry this entire
fucking company on my shoulders.

428
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,814
You're... right?

429
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,573
I wasn't gonna do it.

430
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,455
{\an8}Homelander faces his toughest opponent
yet, our corrupt legal system.

431
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,457
{\an8}Smash that donate button,
get a free tote...

432
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,835
{\an8}Roland Keating attacked Homelander's son.

433
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,049
{\an8}The magic of Vought on Ice,
coming December 7 at VoughtCoin Arena.

434
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,135
{\an8}Things grew heated between the Starlighter

435
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,595
{\an8}and Hometeamer movements
outside the courthouse today.

436
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,308
{\an8}This creep had photos of his
quote-unquote "niece"

437
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,101
{\an8}naked in the bathtub.

438
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,729
{\an8}He's an antifa pedo who
fucked around and found out.

439
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,372
{\an8}And "an eye for an eye" might be
in the Jew section of the Bible,

440
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,600
{\an8}but it is still in the Bible.

441
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,123
Yes. Steady.

442
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,249
Good, good.

443
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:08,961
Yes.

444
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:14,383
Annie, that was awesome. Look, look.
It's a new record. 33 seconds.

445
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:18,679
Oh, amazing. I can fly 100 feet away
from all my cares.

446
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,723
And drain the power grid at the same time.

447
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,974
What would Greta say?

448
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,281
Six months of work, <i>c'est merde!</i>

449
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,325
So the acid didn't work.

450
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,370
We'll think of something else.

451
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,413
Like what? Yeah.

452
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,876
Hey, look, I-I-I totally agree
with whatever you said.

453
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,103
No one wants Neuman gone more than me,

454
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,338
and no one knows how dangerous
she is for the country.

455
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,717
Yeah, we may never get another shot
like that ever again...

456
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,969
- I am really bad at pep talks.
- Oh, you think?

457
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,390
All right, I'm out of here.

458
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,642
Recycling bin, motherfucker.

459
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,107
What?

460
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,819
- He blew our cover with Neuman.
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,404
He almost got you killed again.

462
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,405
Uh-huh.

463
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,032
You're the only one that wants him here.

464
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,325
We should cut him loose.

465
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,786
We're not cutting him loose.

466
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,080
We're not cutting him loose.

467
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,389
Well, it's a fine time to fucking well
bring that up, innit?

468
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,608
It's gonna be a lot harder
to do a murder with them cunts around.

469
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,194
Them? Nah.

470
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,991
They're, uh, hand-picked,
sort of secret-secret service, so...

471
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,617
I'm surprised you called.

472
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,453
I'm full of surprises, ain't I?

473
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,246
What do you want?

474
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:12,251
Well, I was thinking that, uh, you and I
could scratch each other's backs.

475
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,504
Like when you shot me in the head?

476
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,466
I need a hand to get Ryan
away from Homelander.

477
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,135
Is that all?
Boy needs a father.

478
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,428
That cunt ain't no father.

479
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,511
And you are?

480
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,732
You're between a cock and a hard place.

481
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,401
I'm going to put you
into that posh VP slot,

482
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,695
and he's gonna make sure
you spend the next four years

483
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,072
grabbing your ankles
while he shoves it up your ass.

484
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,866
I think I can handle myself.

485
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,629
Oh, you mean that nasty little virus
they cooked you up at Godolkin?

486
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,998
Yeah, I know about it,

487
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,376
and I know it ain't strong enough
to kill Homelander yet.

488
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,129
And then there's the hard place.

489
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:02,092
The full weight of the CIA
and my Boys working 24/7 to top you.

490
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,762
You need me.

491
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:12,520
If I was even gonna think about this...

492
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,730
I'd want a show of good faith.

493
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,858
The material Hughie has on me
from the Red River Group Home.

494
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,777
That don't stop him
from going to the press.

495
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,904
Mm. Stops them from printing it.

496
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:26,617
Just a wild conspiracy theory
from a disgruntled former staffer.

497
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,037
Those are my terms.

498
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,332
You know where to find me.

499
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,847
Motherfucker.
I just logged in five minutes ago.

500
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,683
- What's happening?
- This shit.

501
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,726
Uh... Oh, okay, yeah, you got to hit

502
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,770
"Keep me logged in."

503
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,106
Sorry. Uh, yeah, "Keep me logged in."

504
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,527
But, uh, spoiler alert, that will not
keep you logged in.

505
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,509
<i>This message
is for Hugh Campbell.</i>

506
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,452
<i>I'm calling again from New York
Central Hospital.</i>

507
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,638
<i>Your father was admitted...</i>

508
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,957
Fuck. Fuck!

509
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,375
Kid?

510
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,422
Sorry.

511
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,507
Dad? I'm...

512
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:36,562
The Starlight House,
a so-called "home for at-risk teens."

513
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,647
Sure. And Jeff Epstein killed himself.

514
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,985
No, the only thing these teens are
at risk of is being groomed

515
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,697
and thrown into Starlight's
LGBTerror-dungeon.

516
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,699
<i>Child Lives Matter, folks...</i>

517
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:52,077
It'd be a lot easier to get
media coverage if you were there.

518
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,998
Homelander's verdict will
1,000% be innocent,

519
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,417
and I'm not showing up
to even dignify that shit.

520
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,962
Annie, I'm happy to organize the protest
and-and make the speech,

521
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,464
but no one wants to hear it

522
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,175
'cause it's the Starlighter Movement
and I'm not Starlight.

523
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,886
- Well, neither am I.
- Then, tell that to her.

524
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,266
The whole reason I quit was
to get away from her.

525
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,352
Now, you're killing it
with the Starlighters.

526
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,770
You don't need me.

527
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,189
If... just if... you were Starlight,

528
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:24,068
then maybe we'd drum up
some real donations.

529
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,197
I want to help, of course,
but as Annie January.

530
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,492
No one's donating to the Annie House.
It sounds like we sell raisin cookies.

531
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,243
Hey.

532
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,578
Hey.

533
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,331
So, Colin is annoying as hell,

534
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,501
but he has saved my ass
more than a few times

535
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,545
over the past few months,
so thank you for the rec.

536
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,881
- He's a champ.
<i>- Oh, je t'en prie.</i>

537
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,051
You know, I can tell this even
from our first group meeting.

538
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,345
Anonymous meetings.

539
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,138
Right there in the name.

540
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,269
<i>- Excuse-moi.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,532
<i>Pardon.</i>

542
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,080
I should not have brought up our meetings.

543
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,289
It's okay.

544
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,335
I love my boss knowing
I'm an ex-junkie.

545
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,380
Shit.

546
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,179
I am almost never surprised.

547
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,224
May I come in?

548
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,190
- Sister Sage.
- Just Sage.

549
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,068
Right.

550
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,278
Vought added the "Sister" part.

551
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,489
Can't have one of us
without a racial qualifier.

552
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,908
- Ha.
- Never seen you without the suit.

553
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,827
Why incognito?

554
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,763
You know, I would've thought
the smartest woman on Earth

555
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,580
would have a nicer place.

556
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,957
Smartest person,

557
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,585
and that person's too smart
to give a fuck about Pottery Barn.

558
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,921
Okay. Preach, sister.

559
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,214
Well, um...

560
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,884
You're so smart.

561
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:36,969
Show me.

562
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,055
Show me.

563
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,811
Based on your public appearances,

564
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,939
your stylist is
dying your hair more often.

565
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,942
Used to be every month,
now it's every 2.4 weeks.

566
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,526
Did she tell you you're going gray,

567
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,069
or is she hiding it?

568
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,238
So between that
and your enlarged prostate...

569
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,031
- My fucking what?
- Look at your hands.

570
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,242
You've been washing them more often,

571
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,995
so likely you've been
peeing more often, which makes sense.

572
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,914
You got a lot of power, but you do age.

573
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:10,294
Plus, there's that small matter
your own father almost killed you.

574
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,421
Wow.

575
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,845
Any mouth breather could see you're
going through some existential midlife...

576
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,263
whatever.

577
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,308
Pretty ballsy for someone
whose power is a party trick.

578
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,476
You are welcome to laser me,

579
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,229
but I'm guessing you need me
and my party trick for something.

580
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,816
Hmm.

581
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,067
I need advice.

582
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,237
From someone on my level.

583
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,367
Of course, if you breathe a word of this,
I'll pull you apart bit by bit.

584
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,451
Naturally.

585
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,915
God, I've spent my life
scaling to the peak of-of Vought.

586
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:52,544
It's all I ever wanted.
And-and... now that I have it...

587
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,921
You're still not happy?

588
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:01,511
I save people, they cheer.
I fucking kill people, they cheer.

589
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,972
It's-it's meaningless.

590
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,852
Humans are nothing.
They're, they're less than nothing.

591
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,438
They're just toys for my amusement.

592
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,232
And yet they control everything.

593
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,651
It's unnatural.

594
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,279
What kind of legacy
am-am I gonna leave to my son?

595
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,949
A shithole country
in a shithole world?

596
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,033
Or something better?

597
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:27,996
Something... pure and cleansed.

598
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,832
Like... marble.

599
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,628
You do realize that probably
won't make you happy, either.

600
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,712
Still.

601
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,715
Tell me how you'd go about it.

602
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,927
Hypothetically.

603
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,432
Well... Greece,

604
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:52,562
all democracies, they fail
because people are fucking stupid.

605
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:57,693
You don't need an army of Supermen
like Nazi bae wanted... so German.

606
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,449
If you crush the masses,
who builds your monuments?

607
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,701
Who tongues your taint?

608
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,494
No.

609
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,206
The people will tear it apart themselves,

610
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,500
just got to nudge 'em a little.

611
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,295
Then you get to swoop in,
be the one saving it.

612
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,173
Like Caesar.

613
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,467
Like Caesar.

614
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,761
Statistically, it's inevitable.

615
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,359
- I'd like you to join the Seven.
- No fucking way.

616
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,319
- Why not?
- Because I'm not wearing

617
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:45,449
some vaguely racist super suit
in front of a bunch of clapping seals.

618
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:49,286
Plus, I'm a Black woman who is
a thousand times smarter than you.

619
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,204
Your ego can't handle it.

620
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,458
- I'm pretty smart myself.
- See what I mean?

621
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,168
Smart enough to listen.

622
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,213
I mean really listen to you.

623
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,050
You can stay here,

624
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,845
reeking of Taco Bell and loneliness,

625
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,807
or we can put some of your theories
into practice on a global scale.

626
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,062
When's the last time
you got a chance like that?

627
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,655
Butcher, what are you doing here?

628
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,240
Couldn't sleep.

629
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,995
What about you?

630
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,373
Um, my dad, he, uh, he had a stroke.

631
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,458
Oh, fuck.

632
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm sorry to hear that, mate.

633
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:41,296
Just gonna grab a few things
before I get back to him.

634
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,965
- Is he, uh...
- I-I don't know.

635
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:53,350
He-he called me right before it happened,
and, um... I didn't pick up.

636
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,520
Why didn't I pick up?

637
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,122
I mean, maybe I could've seen it coming.

638
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,665
- I could... I could've...
- No, no, no. Hughie.

639
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,567
Don't beat yourself up about it.
There's nothing you could've done.

640
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:06,446
All he ever wants is to chat about some
stupid fucking James Patterson book

641
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,591
that he's reading,
and I couldn't even give him that.

642
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,743
And now they're saying
that even if he lives...

643
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,413
God.

644
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:16,998
Yeah, well, I know what I'd want.

645
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,085
Quick lights out.
Better than the alternative.

646
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,505
Sitting there, stewing in your mistakes...

647
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,633
...as you wait out the inevitable.

648
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,821
I hope your old man pulls through.

649
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,950
Thank you. I... Oh.

650
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,038
- Hughie?
- Hey.

651
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,332
I'm so sorry.

652
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,710
I got here as soon as I could.

653
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,545
I'm sorry.

654
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,755
I'm okay.

655
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,400
Turn here.

656
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,401
- Right here?
- Yes.

657
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,405
So, what does the CIA think of you
wasting their vast resources,

658
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,532
all to hunt down the phone of Todd?

659
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,159
I didn't ask.

660
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,286
Just like I didn't ask you
to come, either.

661
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:40,123
Mm. We are here for you always, <i>mon ami.</i>

662
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,090
Colin?

663
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,762
Why do you ask?

664
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,722
You've been spending a lot of time...

665
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,058
...together in the bathroom...

666
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,520
Sorry, I should've said something.

667
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,982
But it's complicated.

668
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,947
To be clear

669
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,491
I love you.

670
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,784
{\an8} <i>Moi aussi.</i>

671
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,453
But you and I..

672
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,413
Are not happening.

673
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:21,790
I know.

674
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,585
So if Colin makes you happy...

675
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,797
Go be happy.

676
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,093
Yo, white boy spotted.

677
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,293
How's it going, Nick?
Here for the meet-up?

678
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,694
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

679
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:51,778
Cool.

680
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,595
That's a good question.

681
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,389
- What's that?
- She wonders, uh...

682
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,249
how a man such as this
win the love of a woman

683
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,458
like Monique, you know?

684
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,144
Oh, he's, uh,
he's nice to my daughter.

685
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,646
Come on,
there is only one reason.

686
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,132
Todd must be packing
some serious heat between his legs.

687
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,926
Seriously, Frenchie,
you did not have to come.

688
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,070
Okay, I'm only saying,

689
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:20,390
the man has some serious
Pete Davidson energy over there, no?

690
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:28,106
- You recognize her?
- Not sure.

691
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,942
Hi, fellas. Thanks for making it
on such short notice.

692
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:34,195
He's here, right?
Like, in the building here?

693
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,699
This is the best day of my life.

694
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,368
Yeah.

695
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,500
Well, you know, Dirk, I'm not actually
holding my breath underwater.

696
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,419
I'm technically breathing underwater.

697
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,338
So it's more impressive.

698
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,631
Mmm. A-Train, try these
buffalo ranch bacon blasters.

699
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,716
They're juicy.

700
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,676
Sage.

701
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,261
It's good to see you again.

702
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,025
What the fuck
are you doing here?

703
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,183
Homelander's tired of being
surrounded by morons.

704
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,103
- Hello, everyone.
- Homelander!

705
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,023
I just want to say, it's a huge honor
to be here with you.

706
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,649
Right. Now, I can't stay long,

707
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,362
but I heard that you are
some of my biggest fans,

708
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,822
supporting me
when others turned their backs.

709
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,783
I just wanted to personally say...

710
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:25,622
thank you for your devotion
and your sacrifice.

711
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:31,586
W... Well, really, it's you
who gives so much to...

712
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,797
You people are more than just fans.

713
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,717
You're martyrs
to the greatest cause on Earth.

714
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,969
- Open it.
- You got it.

715
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,808
Whoa. Bats.

716
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,142
Yeah.

717
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:51,564
I want you to take these bats

718
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,024
and beat these gentlemen to death.

719
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:04,869
You're funny.

720
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:09,040
Oh, it's like one of your tests.
You want us to say no.

721
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,375
No, Deep.

722
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,086
This is not a test.

723
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:20,927
I want you to beat
these gentlemen to death... now.

724
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,017
I think maybe we should go.

725
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,728
Oh, Jesus!

726
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:32,814
Mm-hmm.

727
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,150
Oh, shit.

728
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,531
Jesus!

729
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,043
Stay here.

730
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,421
Wait for further instructions.

731
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:10,643
Yo, what the fuck?
That was so fucked-up, you guys.

732
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,190
What the fuck
is he doing here?

733
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,862
He should be at his trial, no?

734
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,155
Shit.

735
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,386
{\an8}<i>This exclusive live footage</i>

736
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,913
{\an8}<i>of Homelander arriving
at the courthouse just now.</i>

737
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,498
{\an8}The verdict will be read any moment.

738
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,209
{\an8}So stay with us
after these important messages.

739
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,521
{\an8}<i>Are you ready to stop reusing
your catheter and start living your life?</i>

740
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,353
The verdict's coming.

741
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,105
Jurors are seated. Any second.

742
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,829
Not guilty!

743
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,548
Fuck you, fascist!

744
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,494
<i>From outside the courthouse</i>

745
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,913
<i>where the jury has returned a verdict.</i>

746
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,558
<i>- Homelander is not guilty of murder.</i>
- Go.

747
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:59,711
<i>The scene outside
the courthouse is chaotic.</i>

748
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,589
<i>- Homelander and Starlight supporters out en masse...</i>
- You got this.

749
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,090
- Go. Go.
- Okay, okay.

750
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,676
<i>...what was a peaceful demonstration
has turned violent.</i>

751
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,596
<i>We urge everyone: Stay home...</i>

752
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,897
Colin...

753
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,778
Colin!

754
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,659
You all right?

755
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,875
Colin. Colin. No, no! It's me.

756
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,585
It's me. Come on.

757
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,047
- I'm-I'm okay. I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

758
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,673
No. Are you all right?

759
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,801
Sorry, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

760
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:52,615
Everyone, remain calm.
We're all very special people.

761
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,576
Stop it. Stop.

762
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:13,469
Everybody, please, please go home!

763
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,305
We can fight but not like this!

764
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,015
Annie! Annie!

765
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,767
Bitch!

766
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,602
- Fucking traitor!
- Hey! Get off of her.

767
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,607
Get off of her!
Get off of her.

768
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,151
Kiara.

769
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,612
Kiara. Kiara?

770
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,782
Oh, God. Help!
Help, someone help.

771
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:38,327
Help, please.

772
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,662
Kiara.

773
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,587
Excuse me, pardon me.

774
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,671
I saw it myself.

775
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,548
It was the Starlighters, man.

776
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,599
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

777
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,186
<i>Please exit the facility
in an orderly fashion.</i>

778
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,107
<i>Please exit the facility
in an orderly fashion.</i>

779
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,401
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

780
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,989
{\an8}Justice prevailed today

781
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,576
{\an8}as the jury in Homelander's murder trial
handed down a not-guilty verdict.

782
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,829
{\an8}<i>But that moment of national healing
was cut tragically short.</i>

783
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:26,793
{\an8}<i>Violent attacks by Starlight supporters
left three innocent patriots dead.</i>

784
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,630
{\an8}<i>Out of respect, we are gonna wait
until all families have been notified</i>

785
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,799
{\an8}<i>before we release
the names of the victims.</i>

786
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,092
<i>But we know
that each of them gave their lives</i>

787
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,512
<i>exercising their constitutional right...</i>

788
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,139
No, let her sleep.

789
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,451
I'll come by first thing in the morning,
we'll tell her together.

790
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:43,768
Yeah.

791
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,412
<i>...that have saved us
over and over</i>

792
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,105
<i>and over, without asking
anything in return.</i>

793
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,440
<i>Folks...</i>

794
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:59,575
<i>Our only solace is that Homelander will
remain free to protect us all.</i>

795
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:03,287
<i>Now that this endless
miscarriage of justice is behind him,</i>

796
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,706
<i>Homelander can return his focus
to what really matters...</i>

797
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,810
<i>- standing up for the good guys.</i>
- You gonna finish that?

798
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,586
<i>- True Americans.</i>
- Oh, come on, buddy.

799
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,713
We're supposed to be celebrating.

800
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,510
What's wrong?

801
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,388
No, it... it's nothing.

802
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,474
Come on, now.
We-we talked about this.

803
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:26,519
We have to share
everything with each other,

804
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:32,233
do everything together,
until we almost merge into one.

805
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,989
So, you tell me, son.
Whatever it is, it's-it's okay.

806
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,451
I don't want Butcher to die.

807
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,129
But even after he abandoned you like that?

808
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,548
That was brutal.

809
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,258
And all those things he said about you.

810
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,428
He said awful, awful things about you.

811
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,305
Just horrible.

812
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,309
My mom loved him.

813
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,615
But what about you?

814
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:42,303
Noir was right,
that was so fucked-up.

815
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,680
You have every right
to be upset.

816
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,766
I'm upset for you.

817
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,226
What if we just left?

818
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,773
We could vanish under the waves forever.

819
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,652
Everyone there loves you for you.

820
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:02,114
As the sweet, sensitive,
really strong swimmer you are.

821
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:07,244
Look at me.

822
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:09,622
Baby, look at me.

823
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,293
We wouldn't have to hide our love anymore.

824
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:18,297
We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.

825
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,572
Mm.

826
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:35,166
<i>Hey, so,
I just finished reading</i> Deadly Cross.

827
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,044
<i>I mean,
how does Patterson do it?</i>

828
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:41,464
<i>I liked it even more than</i>
Criss Cross, Cross Justice,

829
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,340
Double Cross, Triple Cross,

830
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:48,220
Cross Fire, Cross Country,
Cross the Line, <i>even</i> Cross My Heart.

831
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:53,726
<i>You know, so, anyway, lots to talk about.
Uh, give me a call. I love you, son.</i>

832
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:05,696
You get better, okay?

833
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:11,494
You get better, and I will
talk to you for hours about <i>Deadly Cross.</i>

834
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:14,246
You can read the whole
fucking book to me if you want.

835
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,542
Deal?

836
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,213
I really hope you can hear me.

837
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,760
For what it's worth,
I think he can.

838
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,103
Mom?

839
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,153
Billy.

840
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,325
You promised me
you would take care of Ryan.

841
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,496
Bloody hell, what'd you think
I'm trying to do here?

842
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,334
I think you're
about to fuck over Hughie, again.

843
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,711
And it's going to blow up
in your face, again.

844
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:06,423
I saved the kid, at the Tower, didn't I?

845
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,927
I had a clean shot at Homelander,
game, set and fucking match,

846
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,762
but I chose to save him.

847
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,516
And look where it got us.

848
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,061
You promised me.

849
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:25,067
If Ryan becomes like Homelander,
that's the end of the world.

850
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,989
Don't you think I know that?

851
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,241
You have to find a better way.

852
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,121
What the hell do you want from me, Becca?

853
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,421
Be the man that I married.

854
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,264
That man died a long time ago.

855
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,434
It's too late.

856
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,686
I'm out of time...

857
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,176
Oh, for fuck's sake.

858
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,560
Well, I hope you're happy now.
