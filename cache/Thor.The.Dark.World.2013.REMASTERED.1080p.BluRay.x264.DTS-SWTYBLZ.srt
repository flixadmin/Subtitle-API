1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,619
Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.

2
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,828
And from that darkness
came the dark elves.

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,420
Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, malekith

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,425
sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,599
Such evil was possible
through the power of the aether,

6
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,474
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,766
Malekith.

8
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,650
Asgard' s forces are upon us.

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,368
The noble armies of asgard,
led by my father, king bor,

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,412
waged a mighty war
against these creatures.

11
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,675
Sendinthe kurcsed! I

12
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,278
As the nine worlds
converged above him,

13
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,829
malekith could at last
unleash the aether.

14
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,217
But asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.

15
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,432
Without it, the dark elves fell.

16
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,911
With the battle all but lost,

17
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,573
malekith sacrificed his own people

18
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,457
in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to asgard's army.

19
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,632
Theirdeaths will mean our survival

20
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,087
thiswarisfarfrom over

21
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,316
Malekith was vanquishea,
ahd the aether was no more.

22
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,227
Or so we were led to believe.

23
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,032
Sire, the aether. Shall we destroy it?

24
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,069
If only we could.

25
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,078
But its power is too great.

26
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,157
Bury it deep.

27
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,705
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

28
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,539
Loki.

29
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,253
Hello, mother.

30
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,627
Have I made you proud?

31
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,167
Please, don't make this worse.

32
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,093
Define "worse."

33
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,845
Enough!

34
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,302
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

35
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,697
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

36
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,235
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

37
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,204
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

38
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,365
and death.

39
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,752
I went down to midgard to rule the
people of earth as a benevolent god.

40
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,088
Just like you.

41
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,043
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

42
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,590
Just as humans do.

43
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,923
Give or take 5,000 years.

44
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,844
All this because loki desires a throne.

45
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,353
It is my birthright.

46
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,857
Your birthright was to die

47
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,897
as a child.

48
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,487
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

49
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,616
If I had not taken you in,

50
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,403
you would not be here now to hate me.

51
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,705
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

52
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,283
just swing it.

53
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,597
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

54
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,583
it's just...

55
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,336
I don't love them.

56
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,671
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

57
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,172
and you will never see her again.

58
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,387
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

59
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,638
And what of Thor?

60
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,859
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

61
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,520
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

62
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,219
He will bring order to the nine realms

63
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,323
and then, yes...

64
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,156
He will be king.

65
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,250
I've got this completely under control!

66
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,457
Is that why everything is on fire?

67
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,025
You're welcome.

68
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,714
All yours.

69
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,369
Hello.

70
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,284
I accept your surrender.

71
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,510
Anyone else?

72
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,935
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

73
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,146
Keep moving. Come on!

74
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,080
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

75
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,867
Where do we go next?

76
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,005
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the nine realms.

77
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,671
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

78
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,426
Asgard can wait.

79
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,804
You have my thanks.

80
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,637
As you have mine.

81
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,438
Heimdall, when you're ready.

82
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,356
Is anaheim secure?

83
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,987
As are nornheim and Ria.

84
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,841
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

85
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,866
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

86
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,114
That was not my intent.

87
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,624
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

88
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,497
the nine realms are at peace.

89
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,084
They're well reminded of our strength

90
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,877
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

91
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,086
Thank you.

92
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,713
Nothing out of order

93
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,012
except your confused
and distracted heart.

94
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,427
This isn't about Jane foster, father.

95
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,496
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

96
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,689
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

97
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,090
I'm telling you this, not as the allfather,

98
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,149
but as your father.

99
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
You are ready.

100
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,361
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

101
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,233
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

102
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,365
Join your warriors.

103
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,912
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

104
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,374
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

105
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,625
Another!

106
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,849
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

107
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,278
I remember you celebrated
the battle of harokin

108
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,647
so much that you nearly
started the second.

109
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,317
Well, the first was so much fun.

110
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,829
Take a drink with me.

111
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,999
Surely, the allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

112
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,004
No, this is one I set myself.

113
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,048
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

114
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,421
There are nine realms.

115
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,557
The future king of asgard
must focus on more than one.

116
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,389
I thank you for your sword

117
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,601
and for your counsel, good lady sif.

118
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,091
Hi.

119
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,416
Hi.

120
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
So, what's the story with you?

121
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,636
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

122
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,965
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

123
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,019
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

124
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,514
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

125
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,728
I think there's a story

126
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,062
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

127
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,068
It's complicated.

128
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,398
Is he still around?

129
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,525
No, he...

130
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,194
Went away.

131
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,733
I've been there.

132
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,947
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

133
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,453
I was seeing a woman

134
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,410
and she took a job in New York.

135
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,870
Eventually, the distance killed it.

136
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,419
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

137
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,171
- No!
- Oh, so many.

138
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,335
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

139
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,547
Sure, I'd love some.

140
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,261
Richard, this is Darcy.

141
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,764
What are you doing here?

142
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,978
Oh. Hello.

143
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,813
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

144
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,650
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

145
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,485
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

146
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,655
You know who.

147
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,403
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

148
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,221
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

149
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,306
Is there a point to all this?

150
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,410
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

151
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,663
Right.

152
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,769
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

153
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,251
You might want
to start looking at it again.

154
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,417
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

155
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,549
It's malfunctioning.

156
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,634
That's what I said.

157
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,588
That's what I did.

158
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,783
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

159
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,367
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

160
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,593
It doesn't look like nothing.

161
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,246
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

162
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,350
Our friend Erik

163
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,470
kind of went banana balls.

164
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,607
He's not interested.

165
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,877
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

166
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,311
It's time for you to go now.

167
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,775
Okay.

168
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,151
Short but sweet.

169
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,949
She needs help.

170
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,162
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

171
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,198
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

172
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,667
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

173
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,298
Sea bass...

174
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,594
Sea bass.

175
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,089
Jane?

176
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,761
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

177
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,884
and go after your friend.

178
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,007
This was so fun.

179
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,930
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

180
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,821
And I hate you.

181
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,570
What? I said he was cute.

182
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,739
Just shut up and drive.

183
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,076
You need to take the next left.

184
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,037
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

185
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,377
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,499
Hello, Dr. foster.

187
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,476
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

188
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,838
Right. I have to call Erik.

189
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,305
Oh, take a right.

190
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,641
And a left.

191
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,689
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

192
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,309
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

193
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,366
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

194
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,901
I'm here at stonehenge

195
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,238
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

196
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,069
The police were called to the scene

197
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,162
after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area

198
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,039
then, decided to strip naked
and effectively

199
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,288
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment

200
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,298
whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.

201
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,678
The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik selvig

202
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,381
has been called in
for questioning by police.

203
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,431
Come on, this is exciting.

204
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,720
Look! The intern is excited.

205
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,056
"Ian."

206
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,648
Do you want the phase meter?

207
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,191
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

208
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,152
The toaster-looking thing.

209
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,859
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

210
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,907
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?

211
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,957
An astrophysicist with three degrees

212
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,785
should be able
to change her own ringtone.

213
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,378
Why are you calling me?

214
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,706
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

215
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,291
"Ian." my name is LAN.

216
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,021
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

217
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,643
It's okay, we're Americans.

218
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,694
Is that supposed to make them like us?

219
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,522
They'll make it go away.

220
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,450
Oh, they're kids.

221
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,903
Are you the police?

222
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,247
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

223
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,623
Thanks.

224
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,413
We just found it.

225
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,837
Can you show us?

226
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,817
That doesn't seem right.

227
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Where'd it go?

228
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,443
That's...

229
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,108
That's incredible!

230
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,244
What happened?

231
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,784
Sometimes they come back.

232
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,498
Sometimes they don't.

233
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,668
I want to throw something!

234
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,917
Jane, give me your shoe.

235
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,716
I haven't seen readings like this since...

236
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,350
Since...

237
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,476
New Mexico?

238
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,934
Don't touch anything!

239
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,276
Give me your shoe.

240
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,799
Were those the car keys?

241
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,507
Darcy!

242
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,787
The aether awakens us.

243
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,423
The convergence returns.

244
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,811
You're late.

245
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,145
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

246
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,963
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

247
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,653
Perhaps.

248
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,658
How fare the stars?

249
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,490
Still shining.

250
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,451
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

251
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,081
Do you recall
what I taught you of the convergence?

252
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,338
Yes.

253
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,834
The alignment of the worlds.

254
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,718
It approaches, doesn't it?

255
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,840
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

256
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,102
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

257
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,060
But while its effects can be dangerous,

258
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,735
it is truly beautiful.

259
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,487
I see nothing.

260
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,192
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

261
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,373
How is she?

262
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,454
She's quite clever, your mortal.

263
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,827
She doesn't know it yet,

264
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,413
but she studies
the convergence as well.

265
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,797
Even...

266
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,962
What?

267
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,217
I can't see her.

268
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,214
Janel

269
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,094
where the hell were you?

270
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,846
Tell me you didn't call the police.

271
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,052
What was I supposed to do?

272
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,974
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

273
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,334
You call the cops, they call the feds.

274
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,461
Next thing you know,
we have s.H.I.Le.L.D. Crawling all over

275
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,941
- "area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

276
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,111
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

277
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,482
We had unimpeded access.

278
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,110
Our only competition was ten years old!

279
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,821
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

280
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,655
What?

281
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,123
That's weird.

282
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,103
Typical.

283
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,897
Jane.

284
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,316
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

285
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,984
It's been a very strange day.

286
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,652
I am. Jane, what...

287
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,116
Where were you?

288
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,332
Where were you?

289
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,581
Heimdall cannot see you.

290
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,492
I was right here where you left me.

291
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,836
I was waiting, and then I was crying

292
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,500
and then I went out looking for you.

293
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,210
You said you were coming back.

294
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,716
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

295
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,423
The nine realms erupted into chaos.

296
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,716
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

297
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,881
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

298
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,221
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

299
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,148
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

300
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,776
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

301
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,649
but I was wrong.

302
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,689
I was a fool.

303
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,034
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

304
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,161
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

305
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,002
What?

306
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,290
I know...

307
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,622
You do?

308
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,215
Do what?

309
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,960
What?

310
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,555
Hey!

311
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,763
Is this you?

312
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,947
We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

313
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,644
I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.

314
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,901
Hold that thought.

315
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,904
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

316
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,652
How's space?

317
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,858
Space is fine.

318
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,235
Excuse me.

319
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,493
Are you Jane foster? Yes.

320
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,581
Do you know this man?

321
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,240
He's my intern.

322
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,579
My intern's intern.

323
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,773
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

324
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,082
You'll have to come with me.

325
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,888
Jane.

326
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,637
- Jane.
- Thor?

327
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:05,975
Are you all right?

328
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,345
What just happened?

329
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,427
Place your hands on your heads.
Step back.

330
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,557
This woman is unwell.

331
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,648
She's dangerous.

332
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,981
Soam I.

333
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,102
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

334
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,103
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

335
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,493
Holy shit.

336
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,022
We have to do that again.

337
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,489
Hi.

338
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,487
Welcome to asgard.

339
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,515
Look upon my legacy, algrim.

340
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,720
I can barelyremember atime
before the light.

341
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,645
Our survival will be your legacy.

342
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,275
The asgardians will suffer
aswe have suffered

343
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,606
I will reclaimthe aether

344
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,941
I will restore our world

345
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,742
and I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

346
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,046
What's that?

347
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,166
Be still.

348
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,089
This is not of earth. What is it?

349
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,553
We do not know.

350
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,229
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

351
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,459
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

352
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,904
It's a soul forge.

353
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,242
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

354
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,158
Yes.

355
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,031
Quantum field generator.

356
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,081
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

357
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,370
She is ill.

358
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,747
She is mortal.

359
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,461
Iliness is their defining trait.

360
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,274
I brought her here
because we can help her.

361
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,215
She does not belong here in asgard

362
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,756
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

363
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,515
Did he just...

364
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,184
Who do you think you are?

365
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,808
I am Odin, king of asgard.

366
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,518
Protector of the nine realms.

367
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,312
Well, I'm...

368
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,278
I know very well who you are,
Jane foster.

369
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,605
You told your dad about me?

370
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,949
Something is within her, father.

371
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,388
Something I have not seen before.

372
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,618
Her world has its healers.

373
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,667
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

374
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,577
Guards, take her back to midgard.

375
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,450
No, I would not...

376
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,377
Touch her.

377
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,792
Jane, are you all right?

378
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,457
Yeah.

379
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,420
It's impossible.

380
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,383
The infection... it's defending her.

381
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,304
No.

382
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,474
It's defending itself.

383
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,515
Come with me.

384
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,439
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

385
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,481
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

386
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,984
The nine realms are not eternal.

387
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,322
They had a dawn

388
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,657
as they will have a dusk.

389
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,999
But before that dawn

390
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:05,504
the dark forces, the dark elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

391
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,752
"Born of eternal night

392
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,718
"the dark elves come
to steal away the light."

393
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,593
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

394
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,926
Their leader malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

395
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,601
and it was called the aether.

396
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,726
While the other relics
often appear as stones

397
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,479
the aether is fluid and everchanging.

398
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,235
It changes matter into dark matter.

399
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,948
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

400
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,160
Malekith sought to use
the aether's power

401
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,073
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

402
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,367
But, after eternities of bloodshed

403
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,045
my father bor finally triumphed

404
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,709
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

405
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,881
What happened?

406
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,093
He killed them all.

407
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,386
Are you certain?

408
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,539
The aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

409
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,803
and yet here it is.

410
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,393
The dark elves are dead.

411
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,526
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

412
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,614
No.

413
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,231
It does not.

414
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,952
The worlds are nearly aligned.

415
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,125
You will be the last of the kurcsed

416
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,920
let my life be sacrificed.

417
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,598
[Tis noless than our people did,

418
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,429
or you have done.

419
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,193
You will become darkness.

420
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,115
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

421
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,242
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

422
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:16,131
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to auniverse reborn.

423
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,360
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

424
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,827
Oh, please! If they were beneath you,
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

425
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,506
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

426
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,682
Odin continues to bring me new friends.

427
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,804
How thoughtful.

428
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,524
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

429
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,317
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

430
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,524
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, loki.

431
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,654
Have you?

432
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,535
Does Odin share your concern?

433
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,535
Does Thor?

434
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,327
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

435
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,538
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

436
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,422
My actions?

437
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,835
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

438
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,590
That I was born to be a king.

439
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,637
A king?

440
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,716
A true king admits his faults.

441
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,292
What of the lives you took on earth?

442
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,018
A mere handful
compared to the number

443
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,891
that Odin has taken himself.

444
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,728
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

445
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,820
Then am I not your mother?

446
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,993
You're not.

447
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,753
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

448
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,101
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

449
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,473
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

450
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,270
You were no longer on earth.

451
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,729
How is that possible?

452
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,902
I believe you were and you weren't.

453
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,856
The nine realms
travel within yggdrasil

454
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,401
orbiting midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

455
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,697
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

456
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,999
and we call this the convergence.

457
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,793
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

458
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,254
It's possible
you found one of these points.

459
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,512
We are lucky that it remained open.

460
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,926
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

461
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,391
then the connection is lost.

462
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,528
I like the way you explain things.

463
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,198
What's going to happen to me?

464
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,957
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

465
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,291
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

466
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,167
Don't let him hear you say that.

467
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,836
Jane foster...

468
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,258
Please meet frigga,

469
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,256
queen of asgard, and my mother.

470
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,473
Hi.

471
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,019
Move!

472
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,855
To the dungeons!

473
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,242
Come on!

474
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,470
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

475
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,861
The prisons.

476
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,818
- Loki...
- Go.

477
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,823
I will look after her.

478
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,855
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

479
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,926
There's no pleasing some creatures.

480
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,848
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

481
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,184
You have my word.

482
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,359
Very well, you do not have my word.

483
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,238
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.

484
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,912
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

485
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,667
- Odin.
- Frigga.

486
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,546
Gol

487
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,580
it's a skirmish.

488
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,876
Nothing to fear.

489
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,458
You've never been a very good liar.

490
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,468
Take her to your chambers.

491
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,419
I'll come for you when it's safe.

492
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,046
You take care.

493
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,261
Despite all I have survived,

494
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,767
my queen still worries over me.

495
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,207
It's only because I worry over you

496
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,062
that you have survived.

497
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,774
Listen to me now.

498
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,903
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

499
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,191
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,875
The throne of asgard is destroyed!
To the king!

501
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,694
Frigga.

502
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,907
Stand down, creature,

503
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,696
and you may still survive this.

504
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,873
I have survived worse, woman.

505
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,702
Who are you?

506
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,291
I am malekith.

507
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,082
And I would have what is mine.

508
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,910
You have taken something, child.

509
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,995
Give it back.

510
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,473
Witch!

511
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,679
Where is the aether?

512
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,102
I'll never tell you.

513
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,317
I believe you.

514
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,984
No!

515
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,901
The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle

516
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,150
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

517
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,741
Imagine... imagine that this is our world.

518
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,535
Thank you. And this is another world.

519
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,666
Normally, they're separate.

520
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,543
But during the alignment,

521
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,169
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

522
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,504
All nine realms
are passing through each other

523
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,927
and gravity, light, and even matter,

524
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,634
is crashing from one world to the other.

525
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,890
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

526
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:35,475
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the convergence.

527
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,481
This time, the alignment

528
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,564
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

529
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,232
It's beautiful.

530
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,906
It's simple. Any questions?

531
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,077
Yeah.

532
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,250
Can I have my shoe back?

533
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,005
Heal. You will need your strength
toreclaim the aether

534
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,101
and when you wake,
we will kill them all

535
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,966
Jane foster?

536
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,803
You need to come with us.

537
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,145
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

538
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,684
Our artillery cannot detect them.

539
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,603
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

540
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,902
My king, we are all but defenseless.

541
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,951
She's your prisoner now?

542
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,663
Leave us.

543
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,837
I do not wish to fight with you.

544
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,085
Nor I with you.

545
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,012
But I intend to pursue malekith.

546
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,468
We possess the aether.

547
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,349
Malekith will come to us.

548
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,510
Yes, and he will destroy us.

549
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,721
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

550
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,189
No, I value our people's lives.

551
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,647
I'll take Jane to the dark world,
and draw the enemy away from asgard.

552
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,612
When malekith
pulls the aether from Jane,

553
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,690
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

554
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,654
And I will destroy it and him.

555
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,447
If you fail, you risk this weapon

556
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,372
falling into the hands of our enemies.

557
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,868
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

558
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,960
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

559
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,379
we would never even know it.

560
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,709
If and when he comes

561
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,965
his men will fall
on 10,000 asgardian blades.

562
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,574
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

563
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,554
As many as are needed!

564
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,062
We will fight!

565
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,108
Till the last asgardian breath.

566
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,945
Till the last drop of asgardian blood.

567
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,197
Then how are you different
from malekith?

568
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,001
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

569
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,098
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

570
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,142
stupid s.H.Lle.L.D.
Isn't calling me back.

571
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,106
- What's s.H.I.Le.L.D?
- It's a secret.

572
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,104
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

573
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,024
Thor came back,
he took Jane to asgard,

574
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,740
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

575
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,738
Something else went missing this week

576
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,946
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik selvig

577
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,620
notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York

578
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,079
streaked nude across...

579
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,791
Darcy, you really need to look at this.

580
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,125
Your friend, Erik...

581
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,956
What was his last name again?

582
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,294
And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.

583
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,508
He was later taken into police custody

584
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,428
for psychiatric evaluation.

585
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,639
Police are still refusing to confirm...

586
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,193
You were not at Odin's war council.

587
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,658
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

588
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,155
No one is [0 come

589
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,531
or to go.

590
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,332
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

591
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,211
What use is a guardian such as that?

592
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,416
Malekith will return, you know this.

593
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,006
I need your help.

594
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,224
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

595
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,967
I'm not asking you to.

596
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,519
The realms need their allfather strong
and unchallenged

597
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,226
whether he is or not.

598
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,106
But he is blinded, Heimdall

599
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,934
by hatred and by grief.

600
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,690
As are we all.

601
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,987
I see clearly enough.

602
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,689
The risks are too great.

603
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,699
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

604
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,576
There is no other way.

605
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,749
What do you require of me?

606
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,416
What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.

607
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,754
Success will bring us exile
ahd failure shall mean our death.

608
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,723
Malekith knew the aether was here.
He can sense its power.

609
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,429
If we do nothing,
he will come for it again

610
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,722
but this time, lay waste to all of asgard.

611
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,725
We must move Jane off-world.

612
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,564
The Bifrost has been shut down

613
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,403
and the tesseract
locked away in the vault.

614
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:17,691
There are other paths off asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

615
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,697
One, actually.

616
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,530
No.

617
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,163
Thor. After all this time

618
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,920
and now you come to visit me.

619
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,422
Why?

620
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,801
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

621
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,549
Loki, enough.

622
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,809
No more illusions.

623
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,069
Now you see me, brother.

624
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,495
Did she suffer?

625
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,956
I did not come here to share our grief.

626
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,168
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

627
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,796
Go on.

628
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,628
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

629
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,677
You help me escape asgard
and I will Grant it to you.

630
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,337
Vengeance

631
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,927
and afterward, this cell.

632
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,481
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

633
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,737
What makes you think
you can trust me?

634
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,234
I don't.

635
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,032
Mother did.

636
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,821
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

637
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,122
I did so with a glimmer of hope

638
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,075
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

639
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,170
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

640
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,375
You betray me, and I will kill you.

641
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,598
When do we start?

642
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,016
He will betray you.

643
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,719
He will try.

644
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,684
This is so unlike you, brother.

645
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,853
So clandestine.

646
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,229
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

647
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,857
If you keep speaking, I just might.

648
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,825
Fine. As you wish.

649
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,365
I'm not even here.

650
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,197
Is this better?

651
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,867
It's better company at least.

652
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,916
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

653
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,841
Brother, you look ravishing.

654
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,384
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

655
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,721
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

656
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,930
given that you seem
to like them so much.

657
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,513
This is much better.

658
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,558
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

659
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,021
But the confidence...

660
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,608
I can feel the righteousness surging.

661
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,239
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

662
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,908
Honor? Patriotism?

663
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,995
God bless amer...

664
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,038
What?

665
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,912
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

666
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,955
My dagger, something.

667
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,712
At last.

668
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,513
A little common sense.

669
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,185
And I thought you liked tricks.

670
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,815
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of einherjar

671
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,729
who will see you coming
from miles away.

672
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,530
I won't be the one who comes for her.

673
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,334
I'm not hungry.

674
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,867
What the...

675
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,203
Good. Let's go.

676
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,630
You're...

677
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,760
I'm loki, you may have heard of me.

678
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,385
That was for New York.

679
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,841
I like her.

680
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,638
And what of the allfather?

681
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:17,022
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

682
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,768
You called me here on an urgent matter.

683
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,821
What is it?

684
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,566
Treason, my lord.

685
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,989
Whose?

686
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,736
Mine.

687
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,985
My king!

688
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,071
The mortal has been taken.

689
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,961
Stop Thor.

690
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,161
By any means necessary.

691
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,374
There they are! Take them.

692
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,511
On my command.

693
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,760
I'll hold them off. Take her.

694
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,800
Thank you.

695
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,760
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

696
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,605
It's good to see you, too, sif.

697
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,532
Assuming you can get loki's help
and you can free this mortal

698
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,151
what good would it do?

699
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,113
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

700
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,415
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

701
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,288
I will give you as much time as I can.

702
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,552
If you even think about betraying him...

703
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,299
You'll kill me?

704
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,385
Evidently, there will be a line.

705
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,785
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

706
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,741
I said, "how hard could it be?"

707
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,127
They're on the ship!

708
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,247
Get to the ship!

709
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,549
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

710
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,967
Shut up, loki.

711
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,367
You must have missed something.

712
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,098
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

713
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,767
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

714
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,727
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

715
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,070
Get him! Get him!

716
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,245
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

717
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,714
Look, why don't you let me take over?

718
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,978
I'm clearly the better pilot.

719
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,192
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

720
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,815
which one can actually fly?

721
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,918
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

722
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,005
Jane.

723
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,799
I'm okay.

724
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,263
Not a word.

725
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,759
Now they're following us.

726
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,266
Now they're firing at us.

727
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,838
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, loki,

728
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,193
it's not at all distracting!

729
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,358
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

730
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,129
You know, this is wonderful.

731
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,544
This is a tremendous idea.

732
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,802
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

733
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,212
and escape in that.

734
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,467
Flying around the city,

735
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,924
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

736
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,780
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

737
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,904
I see your time in the dungeons

738
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,577
has made you no less graceful, loki.

739
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,749
You lied to me.

740
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,370
I'm impressed.

741
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,921
I'm glad you're pleased.

742
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,008
Now, do as you promised.

743
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,923
And take us to your secret pathway.

744
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,695
- Fandral.
- Right.

745
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,414
For asgard.

746
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,802
Loki...

747
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,230
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

748
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,308
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

749
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,499
Ta-dal

750
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,383
We must strike now

751
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,430
no

752
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:28,677
Asgard is meaningless.

753
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,811
The aether has found its way home.

754
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,039
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

755
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,834
It would consume you.

756
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,381
She's holding up all right.

757
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,334
For now.

758
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,425
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

759
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,888
Say goodbye.

760
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,761
Not this day.

761
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,681
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

762
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,475
It's a heartbeat.

763
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,891
You'll never be ready.

764
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,839
The only woman
whose love you've prized

765
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,690
will be snatched from you.

766
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,066
And will that satisfy you?

767
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,735
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

768
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,032
Surrender is not in mine.

769
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,318
- The son of Odin...
- No.

770
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,449
Not just of Odin.

771
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,914
You think you alone
were loved of mother?

772
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,076
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

773
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,497
Trust?

774
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,912
Was that her last expression?

775
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,756
Trust? When you let her die?

776
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,592
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

777
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,090
Who put me there?

778
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,223
You know damn well!

779
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,673
You know damn well who!

780
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,603
She wouldn't want us to fight.

781
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,273
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

782
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,484
I wish I could trust you.

783
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,966
Trust my rage.

784
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,511
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. selvig.

785
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,349
What?

786
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,813
Oh, yeah.

787
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,892
My father, Dr. Erik selvig.

788
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,979
One man's leather wallet, brown.

789
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,531
One key ring, three keys.

790
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,571
Prescription medicine...

791
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,569
Various.

792
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,990
- And...
- Erik.

793
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,997
These. Yeah.

794
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,294
Those.

795
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,083
Thank goodness.

796
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,966
Erik.

797
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,878
Yes?

798
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,675
It's Darcy.

799
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,887
Darcy.

800
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,888
So good to see you.

801
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,056
I missed you, too.

802
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,599
How did you find me?

803
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,930
You were naked on TV.

804
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,434
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

805
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,521
Getting weird now.

806
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,066
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

807
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,037
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

808
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,115
I'm LAN by the way, Darcy's intern.

809
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,454
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

810
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,794
Are you all right?

811
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,795
I've had a god in my brain.

812
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,590
I don't recommend it.

813
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,507
Dr. selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

814
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,964
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

815
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,757
Wait. What's happening?

816
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,725
Birds?

817
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,222
Birds are happening?

818
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,558
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

819
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,897
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

820
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,562
- Nerd.
- Look!

821
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,322
Where did they go?

822
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,420
What the hell was that?

823
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,590
Why are you smiling?

824
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,004
There's nothing more reassuring

825
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,766
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

826
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,720
Take me to Jane's lab.

827
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,657
Jane.

828
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,624
Malekith.

829
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,811
All right. Are you ready?

830
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,225
I am.

831
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,978
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

832
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,867
Yes, possibly.

833
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,867
You still don't trust me, brother?

834
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,629
Would you?

835
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,768
No, I wouldn't.

836
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,024
Thor!

837
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,443
No!

838
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,205
You really think I cared about frigga?

839
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,998
About any of you?

840
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,005
All I ever wanted

841
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,543
was you and Odin

842
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,756
dead at my feet!

843
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,398
Malekith!

844
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,475
I am loki of Jotunheim,

845
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,564
and I bring you a gift.

846
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,363
I ask only one thing in return...

847
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,863
A good seat
from which to watch asgard burn.

848
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,737
He is an enemy of asgard.

849
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,574
He was a prisonerin their dungeons.

850
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:20,922
Look at me.

851
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,439
Loki! Now!

852
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,928
No!

853
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,272
See you in hell, monster.

854
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,592
No. No, no, no.

855
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,172
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

856
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,267
I know...

857
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,472
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

858
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:18,723
Stay with me, okay?

859
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,974
I'm sorry.

860
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,233
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

861
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,646
It's okay.

862
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,773
It's all right.

863
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:34,401
I'll tell father what you did here today.

864
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,411
I didn't do it for him.

865
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,335
No!

866
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,186
He's going to unleash it.

867
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:52,484
Not just on asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

868
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,731
How?

869
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:55,987
Jane, how?

870
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,328
I saw him on earth.
Why would he go to earth?

871
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,280
The convergence.

872
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,618
Oh, god.

873
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,149
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the aether.

874
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,661
Then malekith
would've only possessed it

875
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,459
that much sooner.

876
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,007
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

877
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,876
Jane...

878
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,220
Now we're trapped here.

879
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:24,978
It's not me.

880
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,481
Hello?

881
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,815
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

882
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,726
Richard? Where are you?

883
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,069
I'm still at the office.

884
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,153
It's been a crazy day here today.

885
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,152
- Oh, my god, this is amazing.
- Is jt?

886
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,491
I quite enjoyed our lunch

887
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,660
despite never actually
ordering anything.

888
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,156
How am I getting service here?

889
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,364
Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?

890
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,663
No, no, no. Please, whatever you do,
do not hang up the phone.

891
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,661
Okay, then.

892
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,121
I was just wondering
if you want to try again.

893
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,672
Maybe dinner next time.

894
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,374
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

895
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,752
- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.

896
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,845
Oh, my god.

897
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,848
Am I interrupting something?

898
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,602
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

899
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:06,772
Come on.

900
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,084
I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?

901
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,518
Where are we going?

902
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,610
Hello?

903
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,567
Why are there so many shoes in here?

904
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,987
I'll just text her.

905
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:29,455
So, who's Richard?

906
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,086
Really?

907
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,887
- Jane!
- Hey.

908
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,714
You can't just leave like that.

909
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,094
The whole world is going crazy.

910
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,100
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

911
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,437
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

912
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:53,229
Janel how wonderful.

913
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,327
- You've been to asgard.
- Where are your pants?

914
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,147
He says it helps him think.

915
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,929
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

916
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,660
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

917
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:04,949
Okay.

918
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,120
Are you well, Erik?

919
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,074
Your brother's not coming, is he?

920
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,418
Loki 1s dead.

921
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,585
Oh, thank god!

922
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,964
I meant, I'm so sorry.

923
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,629
Thank you.

924
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,108
Forgive me, my liege.

925
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,445
I've returned from
the dark world with news.

926
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:49,997
Thor?

927
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:55,083
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

928
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,131
What?

929
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,711
We found a body.

930
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,551
Loki.

931
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,480
Malekith is going to
fire the aether at a spot

932
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,562
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

933
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,152
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

934
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,649
For each additional world,

935
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,864
the power will increase exponentially.

936
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,027
The effect would be universal.

937
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,778
But the alignment is only temporary.

938
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,910
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

939
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,704
Well, how do we know where that is?

940
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,332
We follow the directions.

941
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,746
This has happened before

942
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,216
thousands of years ago,
and the ancients were there to see it.

943
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,252
All the great constructions,

944
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,804
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

945
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,305
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the convergence.

946
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,477
And they left us a map.

947
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,974
Stonehenge,

948
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,477
snowdon,

949
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,728
the great orme.

950
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,684
These are all coordinates taking us...

951
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,073
Here.

952
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,032
Greenwich?

953
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,735
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

954
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,234
Physics is going to go ballistic.

955
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,121
Increases and decreases in gravity,

956
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,706
spatial extrusions.

957
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,410
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

958
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,916
I better get my pants.

959
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,843
Focus! This is important.

960
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,574
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

961
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,884
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

962
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,682
They're taped together.

963
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:33,180
Do you even know
what these things do?

964
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,178
No.

965
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,524
Neither do I.

966
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,316
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

967
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,132
Holy...

968
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,258
Shit.

969
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,082
You needn't have come
so far, asgardian.

970
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,422
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

971
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,040
Not by your hand.

972
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,877
Your universe was never meant to be.

973
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,054
Your world and your family

974
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,257
will be extinguished!

975
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,889
We're running out of time.

976
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,354
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

977
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:44,023
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

978
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,150
Come on.

979
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,525
Come on, Darcy.

980
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,920
You know, with all that power,

981
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,539
I thought you'd hit harder.

982
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,031
Done.

983
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,666
The convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

984
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,995
That just means we have to
keep malekith busy for eight.

985
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,335
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

986
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,385
That is awesome!

987
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,969
How did you do that?

988
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,349
Well, the gravitational fields

989
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,727
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

990
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,228
Get the guy with the sword!

991
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,521
- Oops.
- Let's go.

992
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,199
What the hell just happened?

993
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:18,996
Move!

994
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,050
What are you all doing?

995
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,844
You need to get out of here, now!

996
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,512
You're joking, right?

997
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:42,645
That's Thor out there.

998
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,803
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

999
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,674
Confirming ship is hostile.

1000
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,718
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

1001
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,223
You have permission to engage.

1002
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,520
Roger.

1003
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:10,722
Missiles locked.

1004
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,308
Missiles away.

1005
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,939
Missiles off target.

1006
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,738
I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.

1007
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,612
Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.

1008
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:24,747
What are you doing?

1009
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:26,321
My signal's not connecting.

1010
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:29,626
Janel

1011
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,791
come on.

1012
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,373
Are you all right?

1013
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:15,547
You saved my life.

1014
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,177
Yeah.

1015
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,546
I guess I did.

1016
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,021
- Darcy?
- Janel

1017
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,481
- LAN!
- Selvig!

1018
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,187
Mew mew!

1019
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,689
Mind the gap.

1020
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:45,993
How do I get to greenwich?

1021
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,029
Take this train. Three stops.

1022
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,617
Mind the gap.

1023
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,503
Sorry. Sorry.

1024
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,664
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1025
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,912
Janel

1026
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,276
Thor!

1027
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,320
We're too late.

1028
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,786
The convergence is at its peak.

1029
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:13,780
Can those things stop him?

1030
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:14,997
Not from here.

1031
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,955
We can't get close enough.

1032
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,245
I can.

1033
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,573
Malekith!

1034
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,199
Darkness returns, asgardian.

1035
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:00,623
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

1036
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,749
I've come to accept your surrender.

1037
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,400
You think you can stop this?

1038
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,900
The aether cannot be destroyed.

1039
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,693
But you can.

1040
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,237
Thor! No.

1041
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:28,627
Janel

1042
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,913
Everybody okay?

1043
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,414
He's gonna come back.

1044
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,789
Except, you know,

1045
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:54,087
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1046
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,089
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1047
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,846
Did he say anything before he left?

1048
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,137
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1049
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:06,346
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1050
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,530
You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.

1051
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,704
You were wrong.

1052
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,157
The alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1053
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,368
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1054
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:33,460
What can asgard offer
its new king in return?

1055
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,500
My life.

1056
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:40,345
Father, I cannot be king of asgard.

1057
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,223
I will protect asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1058
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,595
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1059
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:51,850
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1060
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,524
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1061
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,154
It changes you.

1062
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,654
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1063
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:06,035
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1064
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,662
When you speak,
do I never hear mother's voice?

1065
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,208
This is not for Jane, father.

1066
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,711
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1067
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:19,134
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1068
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,594
It changes nothing.

1069
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,515
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1070
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,552
another who will not take it.

1071
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,845
Is this my legacy?

1072
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,605
Loki died with honor.

1073
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:33,933
I shall try to live the same.

1074
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,438
Is that not legacy enough?

1075
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,789
It belongs to you.

1076
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,284
If you are worthy of it.

1077
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,870
I shall try to be.

1078
01:40:55,299 --> 01:41:00,009
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1079
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,633
I know.

1080
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,809
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1081
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,645
even that, I could not say.

1082
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,769
It would speak only from my heart.

1083
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,566
Go,

1084
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,149
my son.

1085
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,528
Thank you, father.

1086
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,173
No.

1087
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,176
Thank you.

1088
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,608
I present to you,

1089
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,816
taneleer tivan, the collector.

1090
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:21,123
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1091
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,924
You know why we're here.

1092
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,550
Of course.

1093
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,633
But, if I may ask,

1094
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,679
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1095
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,727
The tesseract is already on asgard.

1096
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,398
It is not wise to keep
two infinity stones so close together.

1097
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,522
That's very wise.

1098
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,741
I can assure you,

1099
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,215
it will be absolutely safe here,

1100
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,919
in my collection.

1101
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:15,510
See that it is.

1102
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,569
One down.

1103
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:40,573
Five to go.
