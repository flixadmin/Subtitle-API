00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,750
Words - ''We do not sow.''

163
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,961
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

164
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,381
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

165
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,091
[Laughs]

166
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,302
And failed rebellions.

167
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,725
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

168
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,853
- Good.
- Words - ''Ours is the fury.''

169
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,522
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

170
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,524
The Westerlands.

171
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,735
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

172
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,863
- Words - ''A Lannister always pays his debts.''
- No.

173
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,366
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

174
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,493
- [Arrow thunks]
- Lords - the Lannisters.

175
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,496
- We're still on their words.
- l don't know them.

176
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,540
You do know them. Think.

177
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,126
''Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.''

178
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,921
- That's House Martell.
- ''Righteous in wrath.''

179
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,508
- House Hornwood.
- ''Family, duty, honour.''

180
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,551
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

181
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,222
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

182
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,557
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

183
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,684
Family comes first?

184
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,064
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

185
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,608
How can she protect the family

186
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,069
if she's not with her family?

187
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,405
Your mother sat by your bed

188
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,242
for three weeks while you slept.

189
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,452
And then she left!

190
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,207
When you were born, l was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

191
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,294
l placed you in her arms.

192
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:23,215
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

193
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,760
she will love you.

194
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,554
Absolutely.

195
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,724
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

196
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,685
[Sighs] l still can't tell you,

197
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,271
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

198
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,022
- [Arrow thunks]
- Today?

199
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,775
- No, l don't.
- Then how can you promise me

200
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,944
she'll be home soon?

201
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,324
Sometimes l worry
you're too smart for your own good.

202
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,870
l'll never shoot another arrow.

203
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,373
And where is that written?

204
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,126
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

205
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,712
lf the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

206
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,298
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

207
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,133
Really?

208
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,678
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

209
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
Why shouldn't you?

210
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,978
[Grunting]

211
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,402
[Moans]

212
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,989
Shh, keep it down.

213
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,575
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

214
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,953
l thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

215
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,372
lmportant enough for the likes of you.

216
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,792
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

217
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,379
Who, the Imp?
l'd call him half a nobleman.

218
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,423
Jealous?

219
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,300
Why should l be jealous?

220
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,345
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

221
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,515
What's a dwarf like down below?

222
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,725
l've always wondered.

223
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,937
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

224
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,191
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

225
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,236
Generous tipper.

226
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,030
l guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

227
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,032
You are jealous.

228
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,784
l'm a Greyjoy.

229
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,036
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

230
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,956
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

231
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,999
not even the Lannisters.

232
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,126
And what about the Starks?

233
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,381
l've been Lord Stark's ward
since l was eight years old.

234
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,884
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

235
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,846
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

236
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,140
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

237
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,894
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

238
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,564
You're a very serious boy.

239
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,817
- l'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

240
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,822
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

241
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,283
l don't want to pay for it.

242
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,035
Then get yourself a wife.

243
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,583
- [Arya] Come on.
- [Meows]

244
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,170
- l'm not gonna hurt you.
- [Meows]

245
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,718
[Meows]

246
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,846
How is your son, my lord?

247
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,724
He'll never walk again.

248
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,728
But his mind is sound?

249
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,689
So they say.

250
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,900
A blessing, then.

251
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,196
l sumered an early mutilation myself.

252
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,617
Some doors close forever...

253
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,871
others open
in most unexpected places.

254
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,790
May l?

255
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,256
lf the wrong ears heard
what l'm about to tell you,

256
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,509
off comes my head.

257
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,178
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

258
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,932
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

259
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,476
But there are things you must know.

260
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,938
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

261
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,859
your friend, l know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

262
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,487
l've been in the capital a month.

263
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,366
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

264
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,243
l didn't trust you.

265
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,745
So why do you trust me now?

266
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,667
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

267
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,919
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

268
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,754
You are one of them.

269
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,800
I
l would like to believe l am another
strange as that may seem.

270
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,469
What sort of doom does the king face?

271
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,305
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

272
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,393
The tears of lys, they call it.

273
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,854
A rare and costly thing,

274
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,440
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

275
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,535
Who gave it to him?

276
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,746
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

277
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,084
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

278
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,336
[Sighs] There was one boy.

279
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,006
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

280
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,092
The squire, Ser Hugh?

281
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,096
Pity, what happened to him,

282
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,349
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

283
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,562
lf Ser Hugh poisoned him...

284
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,107
who paid Ser Hugh?

285
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,571
- Someone who could amord it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

286
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,158
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

287
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,160
Why kill him?

288
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,372
He started asking questions.

289
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,338
[Meows]

290
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,695
[Man] He's found
one bastard already.

291
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,989
He has the book.

292
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,033
- The rest will come.
- [Lock clicks]

293
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,452
[Man #2] And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

294
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,287
[Man #1] The gods alone know.

295
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,415
The fools tried to kill his son.

296
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,252
What's worse -
they botched it.

297
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,465
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

298
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,344
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- [Man #2] What good is war now?

299
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,471
We're not ready.

300
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,182
lf one Hand can die,
why not a second?

301
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,893
[Man #1] This Hand is not the other.

302
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,520
[Man #2] We need time.

303
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,815
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

304
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,318
- You know what these savages are.
- ''Delay,'' you say.

305
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,404
''Move fast,'' l reply.

306
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,782
This is no longer
a game for two players.

307
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,951
[Man #2] It never was.

308
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,515
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

309
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,186
l admire your industry.

310
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,897
You do move quietly.

311
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,524
We all have our qualities.

312
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,527
You look a bit lonely today.

313
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,030
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

314
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,574
- First boy is on the house.
- l think you're mistaking

315
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,577
- business with pleasure.
- Am l?

316
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,374
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

317
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,920
Trust me,

318
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,672
we accommodate all inclinations.

319
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,802
Oh, l'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, l hear.

320
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:10,724
l'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

321
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,521
Though l suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

322
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:20,067
ls it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

323
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,903
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

324
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,448
And l heard the most amul rumour
about a certain lord

325
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,575
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

326
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,871
Must be enormously dimicult
to accommodate that inclination.

327
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,915
The logistics alone...

328
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,293
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

329
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,506
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

330
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,008
Strictly speaking.

331
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,724
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

332
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,270
l've often wondered.

333
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,481
Do you know,
l have no idea where they are.

334
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:03,318
- And we had been so close.
- [Chuckles]

335
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,112
But enough about me.
How have you been

336
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,322
since we last saw each other?

337
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,950
Since you last saw me
or since l last saw you?

338
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,453
Now the last time l saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

339
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,331
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes l own.

340
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,958
Council business.

341
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,086
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

342
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,175
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

343
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,721
lf the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

344
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:36,143
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

345
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,271
to think a simple word to the queen...

346
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,690
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

347
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,234
But you know something?
l do believe that l have seen you

348
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,278
even more recently
than you have seen me.

349
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,156
- Have you?
- Yes.

350
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,991
Earlier today, l distinctly recall

351
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,535
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

352
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,787
Was that you under the bed?

353
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,831
And not long after that

354
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,584
when l saw you escorting a certain

355
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,754
foreign dignitary...

356
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,215
Council business?

357
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,551
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

358
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:12,221
You're from there yourself, after all.

359
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,516
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

360
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,851
l'd like to think we are.

361
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,145
So you can imagine my burden,

362
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,941
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

363
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:28,028
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

364
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,947
turning right loyalty to the realm...

365
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,366
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

366
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,409
- where a simple word to the king...
- [Door opens]

367
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,662
What are you two conspiring about?

368
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,082
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

369
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,210
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

370
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,213
Disturbing news from far away.

371
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,883
Hadn't you heard?

372
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,928
[Birds cawing, waves breaking]

373
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,914
Off with you. No begging.

374
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,916
l'm not a beggar.
l live here.

375
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,169
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

376
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,129
l want to see my father.

377
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,965
l want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

378
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,800
You want your father, boy?

379
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:36,013
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

380
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,557
My father is Hand of the King!

381
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,226
l'm not a boy.
l'm Arya Stark ofWinterfell.

382
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,730
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

383
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,816
Now are you going to let me by
or do l need to smack you

384
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,402
on the ear to help with your hearing?

385
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,073
You know l had half my guard
out searching for you?

386
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,788
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

387
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,541
- Who did?
- l didn't see them,

388
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,460
- but l think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya. [Sighs]

389
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,213
l'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

390
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,216
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

391
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,051
Something about the savage.

392
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,470
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

393
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,806
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

394
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,018
Chasing a cat.

395
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,479
[Knock, door opens]

396
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,855
Pardon, my lord.

397
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,234
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

398
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,160
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

399
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,331
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- l'm a girl!

400
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,041
Did Benjen send you?

401
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,170
No one sent me, my lord.
l'm here to find men for the Wall

402
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,841
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

403
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,552
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

404
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,012
But that's not why l disturb you now.

405
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,141
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

406
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,310
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

407
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,816
lt's for his sake l rode here so hard
l damn near killed my horse.

408
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,609
There are others riding too.

409
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,237
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

410
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,698
Know what?

411
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,367
Best said in private, my lord.

412
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,042
Go on. We'll talk more later.

413
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,129
Jory, take her safely to her room.

414
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,673
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

415
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,475
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

416
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,187
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

417
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,023
No fear on that count, little lady.

418
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,114
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

419
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,243
She's taken the Imp.

420
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,131
[Neighs]

421
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,303
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

422
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:25,933
- To whom do l speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

423
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:30,229
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

424
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,523
May l ask, my lady,

425
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,441
why he is with you?

426
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,194
That's why there was no time.

427
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,947
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

428
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,283
My sister will decide what he looks like.

429
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,037
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

430
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,505
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

431
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,259
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

432
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,594
l'll impregnate the bitch.

433
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,430
[Tyrion] l like you.

434
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,276
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

435
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,695
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

436
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,905
l need to see the king first - alone.

437
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,283
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

438
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,368
He has summoned you.

439
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,371
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

440
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,124
l believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

441
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,545
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

442
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,047
l warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

443
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,800
l warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

444
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,136
Well, hear it now.

445
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,723
l want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

446
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,892
And that fool Viserys as well.

447
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,395
ls that plain enough for you?
l want them both dead.

448
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,023
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

449
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,735
Honour?!
l've got seven kingdoms to rule!

450
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,946
One king, seven kingdoms.

451
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,282
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

452
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,534
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

453
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:12,039
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

454
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:16,418
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

455
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,086
because the spider heard a rumour?

456
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,006
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

457
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,426
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

458
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,762
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

459
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,264
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

460
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,976
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

461
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,771
I
Jorah Mormont's a slaver
not a traitor.

462
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,232
Small dimerence, l know,
to an honourable man.

463
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,027
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

464
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,154
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

465
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,908
[Robert] And if he's right?
If she has a son?

466
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,286
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

467
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,249
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

468
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,503
l'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

469
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,547
Do nothing?

470
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,966
That's your wise advice?

471
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,636
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

472
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,847
You're my council.
Counsel!

473
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,642
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

474
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,646
l understand your misgivings, my lord.

475
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,315
Truly, l do.
It is a terrible thing

476
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,442
we must consider, a vile thing.

477
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,820
Yet we who presume to rule

478
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,989
must sometimes do vile things

479
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,324
for the good of the realm.

480
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,786
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

481
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,748
- the realm will bleed.
- l bear this girl no ill will,

482
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,669
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

483
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,130
How many towns will burn?

484
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,466
ls it not wiser, kinder even,

485
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,805
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

486
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,474
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

487
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,852
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

488
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,230
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

489
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,442
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

490
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,492
l followed you into war -

491
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,620
twice,

492
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,538
without doubts,

493
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,707
without second thoughts.

494
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,585
But l will not follow you now.

495
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,588
The Robert l grew up with

496
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:28,175
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

497
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,054
She dies.

498
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,390
l will have no part in it.

499
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,684
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

500
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,313
You'll do as l command
or l'll find me a Hand who will.

501
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,491
And good luck to him.

502
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,370
- l thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

503
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,163
l'm done with you.

504
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,334
Go, run back to Winterfell!

505
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,753
l'll have your head on a spike!

506
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,091
[Robert] l'll put it there myself, you fool!

507
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,093
You think you're too good for this?

508
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,137
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!

509
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,102
l'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

510
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,021
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

511
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,649
Lord Baelish is here for you.

512
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,361
His Grace went on about you
at some length

513
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:33,323
after you took your leave.
The word ''treason'' was mentioned.

514
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:38,203
- What can l do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

515
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,206
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

516
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,002
l'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

517
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,588
lf that sort of thing still interests you.

518
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,299
l don't have the time.

519
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,468
lt won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

520
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,102
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

521
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,689
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

522
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,901
Find them and meet me at the stables.

523
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,366
You bring him here without permission?

524
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,286
You pollute my home with his presence?

525
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,247
[Sucking sounds]

526
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,752
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

527
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,378
You remember her, don't you?

528
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,757
lsn't he beautiful?

529
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,885
And strong too. Jon knew it.

530
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,846
His last words were
''The seed is strong.''

531
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,432
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

532
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,060
his son would grow up to be.

533
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,313
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

534
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,649
Lysa,

535
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,193
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

536
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:54,321
- warning me...
- To stay away from them !

537
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,990
Not to bring one here!

538
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,409
Mummy...

539
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,538
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

540
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:04,581
[Chuckles]

541
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,917
He's little.

542
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,253
[Lysa] He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

543
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,298
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

544
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,884
Oh, did l kill him too?

545
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:20,097
- l've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

546
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,016
These men are knights of the Vale.

547
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,811
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

548
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,813
Every one of them would die for me.

549
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,400
lf any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

550
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,403
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

551
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:38,323
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

552
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,870
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

553
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,706
No one will hurt my baby.

554
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,499
Mummy...

555
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,044
l want to see the bad man fly.

556
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,425
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

557
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,012
l will not have him harmed.

558
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,140
Ser Vardis,

559
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,018
my sister's guest is weary.

560
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,729
Take him down below
so he can rest.

561
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,732
lntroduce him to Mord.

562
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,653
You go sleep, dwarf man. [Chuckles]

563
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,822
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

564
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,574
[Laughs]

565
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,911
[Slams, lock clunks]

566
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,213
[Wind whistling]

567
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,944
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

568
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,738
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

569
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,950
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

570
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,662
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if l slip.

571
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,289
[Scraping]

572
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,086
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

573
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,672
lf you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

574
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,799
l want you.

575
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,970
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

576
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,514
He treats me as if l'm a spoilt child.

577
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,767
Oh, and you're not?

578
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,020
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

579
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,314
How many wars have you fought in?

580
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,693
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

581
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,653
Hold still.

582
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,699
All l ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how l'm not tough enough,

583
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,576
how l squirm at the sight of blood.

584
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,328
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

585
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,372
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

586
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:53,083
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

587
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,336
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

588
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,922
[Groans] It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

589
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,883
l'm good because l work at it -

590
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,760
every day of my life
since l could hold a stick.

591
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,931
l could work at fighting all day, every day,
l'd still never be as good as you.

592
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,434
Yes, well, l guess we'll never know.

593
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,646
[Sighs]

594
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,946
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

595
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,365
So how did it end up?

596
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:30,537
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

597
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,664
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

598
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:36,293
Every time he talks about killing her,
l swear the table rises six inches.

599
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,254
lt's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

600
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,715
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

601
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,259
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

602
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,638
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever sumered to walk the world,

603
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,390
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

604
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:55,646
- l have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

605
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,191
[Laughs] But a lot more than you.

606
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,569
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

607
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,696
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

608
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,241
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

609
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,410
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

610
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,914
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

611
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,958
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

612
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,586
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

613
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,713
And he used to be good at it.

614
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,092
Do you know who should be king?

615
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,469
- Be serious.
- l am.

616
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,721
My father could be your bank.

617
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,765
l've never fought in a war before,

618
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,643
- but l'd fight for you.
- l'm fourth in line.

619
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,771
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

620
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,107
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

621
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,734
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

622
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,028
He's still my older brother.

623
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,573
- [Gasps] What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

624
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,825
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

625
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,244
Sometimes a little spills.

626
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,539
lf you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

627
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,833
You need to get used to it.

628
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,918
Go on. Look.

629
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,089
People love you.

630
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,593
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

631
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,179
They want to be near you.

632
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,225
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

633
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,520
but you don't gloat over it.

634
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,397
You don't love killing.

635
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:28,113
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

636
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:33,035
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

637
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,540
You would be a wonderful king.

638
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,129
[Kissing and sucking sounds]

639
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,138
[Door creaks]

640
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,728
l'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

641
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,438
You seemed so good together.

642
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,858
l'm glad l could do something
to make you happy.

643
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,822
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

644
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:15,619
l suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

645
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,120
No.

646
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,289
He's not serious enough.

647
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,377
l'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

648
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,586
[Robert] Hmm.

649
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:28,298
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

650
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,259
l don't know.

651
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,513
But l do know this -

652
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:40,769
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

653
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:44,147
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

654
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,943
we won't be able to stop them.

655
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,404
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

656
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,740
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

657
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,327
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

658
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,455
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

659
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:03,584
[Chuckles softly] Is my father wrong?

660
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,965
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

661
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,677
with 40,OOO Dothraki screamers at his back.

662
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,138
We hole up in our castles.

663
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,973
A wise move -

664
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:21,727
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

665
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,688
They leave us in our castles.

666
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,275
They go from town to town,
Iooting and burning,

667
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:32,154
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall

668
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,740
stealing all our crops and livestock,

669
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,784
enslaving all our women and children.

670
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,329
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

671
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:43,665
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

672
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,210
hiding behind high walls?

673
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,171
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

674
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:51,673
is the rightful monarch after all?

675
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,469
We still outnumber them.

676
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,140
Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

677
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,643
Five.

678
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,521
Five...

679
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,441
One.

680
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,735
One army - a real army

681
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,697
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

682
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:21,495
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

683
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,747
Now we've got as many armies

684
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,751
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

685
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,837
And everybody wants
something dimerent.

686
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,130
Your father wants to own the world.

687
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:35,551
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

688
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,678
What do you want?

689
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:51,316
We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

690
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,527
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

691
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,696
And that's all the realm is now -

692
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,906
backstabbing and scheming

693
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,034
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

694
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,830
Sometimes l don't know
what holds it together.

695
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,959
- Our marriage.
- [Laughs]

696
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:19,720
Ah, so here we sit,

697
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,558
17 years later,
holding it all together.

698
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,145
Don't you get tired?

699
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,731
Every day.

700
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,943
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

701
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:39,031
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

702
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,700
Yes, it is.

703
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,036
Yes, it is.

704
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,002
What was she like?

705
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,215
You've never asked
about her, not once.

706
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,799
Why not?

707
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,471
At first, just saying her name
even in private

708
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,766
felt like l was breathing life
back into her.

709
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:10,646
l thought if l didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

710
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:13,607
When l realised
that wasn't going to happen,

711
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,776
l refused to ask out of spite.

712
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:21,406
l didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking l cared enough to ask.

713
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,826
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

714
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,829
As far as l could tell
you actually enjoyed it.

715
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,873
So why now?

716
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:36,004
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

717
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,258
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

718
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,138
You want to know the horrible truth?

719
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,394
l can't even remember
what she looked like.

720
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:58,652
l only know she was
the one thing l ever wanted.

721
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,156
Someone took her away from me,

722
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,579
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

723
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,002
l felt something
for you once, you know?

724
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:18,088
l know.

725
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,008
Even after we lost our first boy.

726
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,845
For quite a while, actually.

727
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:33,604
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

728
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,029
No.

729
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:49,536
Does that make you feel better or worse?

730
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,335
lt doesn't make me feel anything.

731
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,515
[Door opens, closes]

732
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,809
She looks like him,

733
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,853
don't she, my lord?

734
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,898
She has his nose,
his black hair.

735
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,442
Aye.

736
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,528
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

737
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,907
lf it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

738
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,204
- l will.
- And tell him l've been with no one else.

739
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,749
l swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

740
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,960
l don't want no jewels or nothing,

741
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,795
just him.

742
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,505
The king was always good to me.

743
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,757
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

744
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,011
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

745
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,931
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

746
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,058
healthy.

747
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,896
Looks healthy enough to me.

748
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,942
The girl shall want for nothing.

749
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,450
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

750
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,202
l've found.

751
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,621
Whores rarely sink.

752
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,753
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

753
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:25,340
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

754
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,010
- [Ned] How many?
- Does it matter?

755
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,971
lf you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

756
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,015
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

757
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,018
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

758
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,313
He was overcome with fatherly love.

759
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,817
Come.

760
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,201
- Jory!
- My lord.

761
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,263
Such a small pack of wolves.

762
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,184
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

763
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,228
Was the Hand of the King.

764
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:23,273
Now l'm not sure what he is -
Lord of somewhere very far away.

765
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,567
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

766
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,905
Get back inside where it's safe.
l'm looking for my brother.

767
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,740
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

768
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:35,953
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

769
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,249
- l remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

770
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,168
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

771
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:47,631
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

772
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,259
- [Littlefinger] My lords!
- [Horse neighs]

773
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,886
l'll bring the City Watch.

774
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,308
Come, Stark.
l'd rather you die sword in hand.

775
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,394
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

776
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,438
As in, ''l'm going to open your lord

777
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:07,150
''from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

778
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:10,112
You kill me,

779
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,698
your brother's a dead man.

780
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,575
You're right.

781
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,369
