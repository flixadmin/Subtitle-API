Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,560
Kinda lonesome back here.

3
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,370
Yeah, little help.

4
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,020
Okay, um, just, I have to
keep my hands on the wheel.

5
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,570
Excuse me. Whoo!

6
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,690
Ah, Dopinder.

7
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Pool. Dead.

8
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,530
Hmm, nice.

9
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,700
DOPINDER: Smells good, no?

10
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,740
Not the Daffodil
Daydream. The girl.

11
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,790
Ah, yes. Gita.

12
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,290
Hmm. She is quite lovely.

13
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,130
She would have made
me a very agreeable wife.

14
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,380
But, um...

15
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,630
Site's heart has been
stolen by my cousin Bandhu.

16
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,590
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

17
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,810
Dopinder, I'm starting to think

18
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,720
there's a reason
I'm in this cab today.

19
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,390
Yeah, sir, you called
for it, remember?

20
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,150
No, my slender brown
friend. Love is a beautiful thing.

21
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,900
When you find
it, the whole world

22
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,230
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

23
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,240
So you gotta hold onto love...

24
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,900
...tight! Ah.

25
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,320
And never let go.

26
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,910
Don't make the
same mistakes I did.

27
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,160
Got it? Yeah.

28
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,830
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

29
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,710
Sir, what does Miss
Mama June taste like?

30
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,750
Like two hobos fucking in a
shoe filled with piss. Okay, enough.

31
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,670
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

32
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,510
Hmm, it's bad.

33
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,590
Uh, why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

34
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh, that's because it's
Christmas Day, Dopinder.

35
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,260
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

36
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,950
I've been waiting one
year, three weeks...

37
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,850
six days and, oh...

38
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,270
14 minutes to make
him fix what he did to me.

39
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,190
And what did he
do to you, Mr. Pool?

40
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,610
This Shit...

41
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Boo!

42
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,880
They won't disappoint.

43
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,300
They'd better not.

44
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,680
And what about next
month's shipment?

45
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,390
There won't be one.

46
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

47
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,730
That won't do.

48
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,230
See, we've had
this small disruption

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,570
to our supply chain...

50
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,660
We'd appreciate your patience.

51
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,410
Okay.

52
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,160
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

53
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,950
Pleasure doing
business with you.

54
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,420
Fucking mutant.

55
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,940
Oh, shit!

56
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,440
I forgot my ammo bag.

57
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,860
Shall we turn back?

58
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,020
No, no time.

59
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,940
Fuck it. I got this.

60
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,360
9,10,11,12 bullets, or bust.

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,530
Right here!

62
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,910
That's, uh, $27.50.

63
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
I never carry a wallet
when I'm working.

64
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,250
Ruins the lines of my suit.

65
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,710
Oh. But, uh,

66
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,120
how about a crisp high five?

67
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,290
Okay.

68
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,630
Merry Christmas.

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,050
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

70
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,550
Hey, yeah I wanna shoop, baby

71
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,470
Shoop shooop
Ba-doop, shoop Ba-doop

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,470
Shoop Ba-doop, Ba-doop, Ba-doop

73
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,580
You're packed and you're
stacked 'specially in the back

74
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,310
Brother, wanna thank your
mother for a butt like that

75
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,730
Can I get some fries with
that shake-shake boobie?

76
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,980
If looks could kill
you would be an Uzi

77
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,570
You're a shotgun, bang!

78
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,650
Wha... Oh!

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,490
Oh, hello. I know, right?

80
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,570
Whose balls did I have to fondle

81
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,330
to get my very own movie?

82
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,580
I can't tell you,

83
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,160
but it does rhyme
with "Polverine."

84
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,580
And let me tell you,

85
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,670
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

86
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,010
Anyway, I got places to
be, a face to fix and, oh...

87
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,760
Bad guys to kill.

88
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,470
Maximum effort.

89
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
WADE: Cock shot.

90
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,370
Ha!

91
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,200
Rich Corinthian leather.

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,000
WADE: I'm looking for Francis!

93
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,210
Have you seen this man?

94
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,290
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

95
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,720
WADE: Ow. Ow!

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,220
Yanky, yanky!

97
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,090
WADE: I've never said
this, but don't swallow.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,940
Shit.

99
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,570
Did I leave the stove on?

100
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,420
i1}REPORTER: Now, breaking news.

101
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
A multi-car collision
turned shots fired

102
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
on the crosstown
expressway this morning.

103
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

104
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,560
Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.

105
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,140
The assailant
appears to be armed,

106
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,640
dangerous, and wearing...

107
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,150
a red suit. A red suit.

108
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,060
Deadpool

109
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,650
Negasonic! Come,
we have mission.

110
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,110
NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD:
Colossus, wait up.

111
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,490
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us...

112
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,830
but he'd rather
act like a child.

113
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,240
A heavily-armed child.

114
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,170
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

115
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,130
Which benefits? The
matching unitards?

116
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,170
The house that blows
up every few years?

117
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,340
Please.

118
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,800
House blowing
up builds character.

119
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,090
You ate breakfast, yes?

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,430
Breakfast is most
important meal of day.

121
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,520
Here, protein bar.
Good for bones.

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,020
Deadpool may try to break yours.

123
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,950
MAN: Get out of the way!

124
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,880
WADE: Hey! Whoo!

125
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,310
WADE: Wait!

126
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,730
You may be wondering,
"Why the red suit?"

127
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,730
Well, that's so bad
guys can't see me bleed.

128
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
This guy's got the right idea.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,730
He wore the brown pants.

130
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,820
Fine! I only have 12 bullets...

131
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,570
so you're gonna have to share!

132
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,410
Let's count them down.

133
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,930
Shit.

134
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,680
Motherfucker!

135
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,100
10! Shit!

136
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,770
Nine. Fuck.

137
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,190
Eight.

138
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,270
Shit-fuck!

139
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,280
Bad Deadpool.

140
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,870
Seven. Good Dead pool.

141
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Oh!

142
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,720
Someone's not counting. Six.

143
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,830
Oh!

144
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,500
Four...

145
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,010
Gotcha.

146
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,930
Right up main street.

147
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,970
Three, two!

148
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,930
Stupid! Worth it.

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,170
Ah!

150
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm touching myself tonight.

151
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,300
Francis!

152
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,880
Francis...

153
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,050
What the shit-biscuit!

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,890
Where you at, Francis?

155
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,900
You're not Francis.

156
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,370
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

157
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,090
WADE: You're probably thinking,

158
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,060
"My boyfriend said this
was a superhero movie...

159
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,690
"but that guy in the
red suit just turned

160
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,920
"that other guy into
a fucking kabab!"

161
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,510
Well, I may be
super, but I'm no hero.

162
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,930
And yeah, technically,
this is a murder.

163
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,270
But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.

164
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,350
And that's exactly
what this is, a love story.

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,860
And to tell it right...

166
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,110
I gotta take you
back to long before

167
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,740
I squeezed this ass
into red spandex.

168
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,280
MERCHANT: Look, would it
help if I slow it down for you?

169
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,780
I didn't order the pizza.

170
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,700
Is this 7348 Red Ledge
Drive? Are you Mr. Merchant?

171
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,750
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

172
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,290
Then who placed the call?

173
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,210
WADE: I did!

174
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,920
Pineapple and olive?

175
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,260
Sweet and salty.

176
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,550
The fuck are you?

177
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,550
The fuck you doing in my crib...

178
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,720
Is it burnt crust?

179
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,640
I... God, I hope not. Um...

180
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,620
Whoa... Man, look, if this
is about that poker game.

181
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,890
I told Howie, I told him that...

182
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,900
Okay, uh, look, just
take whatever you want.

183
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,110
Thanks.

184
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,420
Sir, before you
do anything to him,

185
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,680
do you mind if I get a big tip?

186
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,910
Uh, Jeremy, is it?

187
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,490
Umm-hmm. Wade. Wade Wilson.

188
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,580
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, Jer.

189
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,160
I'm not here for him.

190
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,080
I'm here for you.

191
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,580
On.

192
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,550
Okay, wow, dodged a
big-time bullet on that one.

193
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,590
Not out of the woods yet.

194
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,510
You need to seriously
ease up on the bedazzling.

195
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,510
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

196
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,900
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

197
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,780
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

198
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,100
I will shoot your fucking cat!

199
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,310
I don't really know what
that means. I don't have a cat.

200
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,350
Then whose kitty
litter did I just shit in?

201
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,610
Anyhoo, tell me something...

202
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,360
what situation isn't
improved by pizza?

203
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,780
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

204
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,450
Getting that right? Orflosky?

205
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,870
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

206
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,370
Because she knows you.

207
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,630
Jeremy, I belong
to a group of guys

208
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,790
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

209
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,360
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

210
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,630
but lucky for her...

211
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,050
I got a soft spot.

212
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
But I'm a... A stalker.

213
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,640
Threats hurt, Jer.

214
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,220
Though not nearly as
badly as serrated steel.

215
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,390
So keep away from Meghan.

216
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Cool?

217
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,650
Yes, sir.

218
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
Then we're done.

219
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,150
Wait. We are?

220
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,900
Yeah. We're totally done.

221
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,070
You should've seen your face.

222
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,670
I didn't know what to
do. I was so scared.

223
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
Soft spot, remember?

224
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,330
You even look in her
general direction again...

225
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,930
and you will learn
in the worst of ways

226
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,080
that I have some hard spots too.

227
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,500
That came out wrong.

228
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,840
Or did it?

229
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,020
Mmm... Meghan?

230
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,910
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

231
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,270
No friggin' way.

232
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,340
Should've brought
my roller blades.

233
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,780
Show these kids how it's done.

234
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,200
Oh. And that's why we
do it. But mostly the money.

235
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,290
Hey, think you could
fuck up my step-dad?

236
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,870
I give a guy a pavement facial,

237
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,080
it's because he's earned it.

238
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,960
Hey, wait!

239
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,880
You're my hero.

240
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,460
No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

241
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,550
i1}WADE: Nope. Never will be.

242
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,550
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

244
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,390
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

245
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,600
It's like a job fair
for mercenaries.

246
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,360
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...

247
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,980
except we knock out the
teeth and take the cash.

248
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,070
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.

249
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,990
Buck! Liefeld...

250
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,410
BUCK: Hey, Wade!

251
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,970
Wade Wilson, patron
saint of the pitiful.

252
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,330
What can I do for you?

253
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,120
I'd love a Blow Job.

254
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh, God, me too.

255
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,750
The drink, moose
knuckle. But first...

256
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,440
Hey, and I ain't taking any
babysitting money, all right?

257
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,090
Make sure that
gets back to Ms...

258
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,170
Orlovsky.

259
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah, her.

260
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,630
You sure? Hmm.

261
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,260
You know, for a mere,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

262
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,260
I bet you let the
kid off easy, too.

263
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,180
Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas.

264
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,520
Just a little light stalking.

265
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,240
I was way worse than
him when I was his age.

266
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,940
I was traveling
to exotic places...

267
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,690
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

268
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,620
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

269
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,530
Killing them. Yeah, I've
seen your Instagram.

270
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,190
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

271
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,860
That's classified.

272
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,030
They have a
wonderful TGI Fridays.

273
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,450
All right, Kahlua,
Baileys and...

274
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,790
whipped cream.

275
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,000
I give you a Blow Job.

276
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,870
Why do you make me make that?

277
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,710
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

278
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,130
Take that over to Buck please,

279
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,130
and tell him it's from
Boothe. Little foreplay.

280
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,460
Remind me what
good will come of this?

281
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,550
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

282
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,970
BUCK: Boothe! Oh!

283
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,220
Easy, man. Hold up! Hold up!

284
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
What you want?

285
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,390
Cheers. To your health.
WEASEL: Fuck you.

286
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,980
BOOTHE: Come here, you fat fuck!

287
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,560
That's a new stool.

288
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,900
BUCK: Stay the fuck down.

289
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,240
MAN: Whoa! Took his ass out!

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,080
WEASEL: All right,
move. Move, move, move.

291
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
Buck, go rest.

292
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,020
MAN: Boothe got
hit then went down.

293
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,250
Yeah, he's still breathing.

294
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,510
Nobody wins today.

295
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,260
Nice try, Wade.

296
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,430
You got me. I picked
Boothe in the dead pool.

297
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,840
Who did you pick?

298
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,930
Yeah, Wade, about that, um...

299
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
No.

300
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,430
You did not bet on me to die.

301
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,440
You bet on me to die. Wow!

302
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

303
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,530
Well, joke's on
you. I'm living to 102.

304
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,700
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

305
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm sorry. I just... I
wanted to win money.

306
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,120
I never win anything.

307
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Whatever.

308
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,910
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

309
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,250
Domestic, nothing imported.

310
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

311
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,210
Baby, are you sure you
wanna shoot your whole wad?

312
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,470
Uh... Tight.

313
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,100
Vanessa. Wade.

314
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,600
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

315
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,230
I'd hit that.

316
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,310
Buck, you best
apologize before...

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,650
Yeah, that.

318
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,480
Say the magic
words, Fat Gandalf.

319
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,320
I'm sorry. Breathe
through the nose.

320
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,650
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

321
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,660
Let go. Okay. Hey, oh, oh, oh“.

322
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,800
Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry.

323
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm working on it.

324
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,240
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

325
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,250
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

326
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,080
Merchandise? Huh...

327
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,670
So you, uh...

328
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,170
bump fuzzies for money?

329
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,260
Yep. Rough childhood?

330
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Rougher than yours.

331
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,010
Daddy left before I was born.

332
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,180
Daddy left before
I was conceived.

333
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,070
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

334
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,430
Where else do you put one out?

335
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,770
I was molested.

336
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,520
Me too. Uncle.

337
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,850
Uncles. They took turns.

338
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,520
I watched my own birthday party

339
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,830
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

340
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,190
which also happens to be my...

341
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,110
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

342
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
You had a dishwasher.

343
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
I didn't even know sleep.

344
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,620
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

345
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,160
brownie mix and clown porn.

346
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,460
Who would do such a thing?

347
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,550
Hopefully you, later tonight?

348
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,350
Hey, what can I get
for, uh, $275 and a...

349
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,220
a Yogurtland rewards card?

350
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,890
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

351
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,150
And a low-fat dessert.

352
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,240
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

353
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,830
It's time to put balls in holes.

354
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,410
You said whatever I want.

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
I get it.

356
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,000
You love skee ball.

357
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,330
Apparently more
than you love vagina.

358
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,670
That's a tough call.

359
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,000
I just wanna get to know
the real you, you know.

360
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,010
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

361
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,010
sex object peddled by Hollywood.

362
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,090
VANESSA: Balls in holes.

363
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Balls in holes.

364
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,760
Prepare to lose tragically.

365
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,930
Bring it, big man.

366
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Okay.

367
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,600
Uh-oh.

368
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,190
Uh-oh.

369
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,770
The limited edition

370
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,780
Voltron: Defender of the
Universe ring, por favor.

371
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,740
Okay. Here we go.

372
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,780
Had my eye on this
sucker for a while.

373
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,700
And I will take
the pencil eraser.

374
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,200
BOY: Okay.

375
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,040
You are now the
protector of the planet Arus.

376
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,040
And you can erase stuff...

377
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,460
written in pencil.

378
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,210
M'lady?

379
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,600
Well, I hate to
break it to you...

380
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,460
but your 48 minutes are up.

381
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,800
Hey, how many more
minutes can I get for this?

382
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,300
FYI, five mini
lion-bots come together

383
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,390
to form one super-bot, so...

384
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,730
Five mini lion-bots?
Three minutes.

385
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,850
Deal.

386
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,190
What do we do with the
remaining two minutes, 37 seconds?

387
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Cuddle?

388
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
How long can you keep this up?

389
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,150
All year?

390
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,670
Happy Valentine's Day.

391
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,930
Happy Chinese New Year.

392
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,340
Year of the Dog.

393
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,680
Relax.

394
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,440
And Happy International
Women's Day.

395
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,030
No. No. No.

396
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,530
Happy Lent.

397
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,700
Ow, ow.

398
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,040
Wade'? Sorry.

399
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,540
Happy Halloween.

400
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,710
Happy Halloween.

401
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,220
Happy Thanksgiving.

402
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,390
I love you.

403
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,230
If your left leg is
Thanksgiving...

404
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,020
and your right
leg is Christmas...

405
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,860
can I visit you
between the holidays?

406
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,730
on!

407
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,570
That sweater is terrible.

408
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,240
But red looks good on you.

409
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Red's your color.

410
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,240
Brings out the
bloodshot in your eyes.

411
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,300
Listen, I've been thinking...

412
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,330
Really?

413
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,830
...about why we're
so good together.

414
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,250
Why's that?

415
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,840
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

416
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,420
Hmm.

417
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,590
And, uh, we're like
two jigsaw pieces,

418
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,040
you know, the
weird curvy edges...

419
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,720
You put them together and
you can see the mature on top.

420
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,600
Right.

421
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,260
Wade...

422
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,430
there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

423
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,060
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

424
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,270
Will you, uh...

425
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,400
stick it in my... Marry me?

426
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,360
Uh... Jinx?

427
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,450
Huh.

428
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,450
Where were you hiding that?

429
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,580
Nowhere.

430
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,200
They say one month's
salary. So, uh...

431
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,290
You mean?

432
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,370
I do.

433
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
That's my line.

434
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,460
I love you, Wade Wilson.

435
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,690
You're supposed
to... So that's a...

436
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,130
Yes! Whoo!

437
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,970
Yes!

438
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,600
I feel just like a little girl.

439
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,230
What if I just held
on and never let go?

440
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,900
Just ride a bitch's
back, like Yoda on Luke.

441
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,320
Oh, Star Wars jokes.

442
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,070
Empire.

443
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,740
Jesus Christ.

444
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,740
It's like I made
you in a computer.

445
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Mmm.

446
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,000
Hey.

447
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,500
Perfect.

448
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,750
Let's see. All right, wee break.

449
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,130
Shake it, yeah.

450
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,510
i1}WADE: Here's the thing.

451
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,760
Life is an endless
series of train-wrecks...

452
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,430
with only brief, commercial-like
breaks of happiness.

453
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,020
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

454
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,860
Which meant it
was time to return

455
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,690
to our regularly
scheduled program.

456
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,610
What the...

457
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,820
Oh, my God. Wade?

458
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,370
You're clowning.

459
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,210
You're not clowning?

460
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
I sense clowns.

461
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,380
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

462
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,300
There are certainly
options we can look into.

463
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,170
New drugs are being
developed every day.

464
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,850
So what do we do?

465
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,720
Surely there is
something we can do.

466
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,400
My uncle Ivan was
diagnosed with thyroid cancer...

467
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,920
and there were all these new
experimental drugs from Germany.

468
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,570
WADE: Vanessa's already
working on Plan A, B,

469
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,360
all the way through Z.

470
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,200
Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

471
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,240
Like it's the first
time I'm seeing it.

472
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,410
Or the last.

473
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,000
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson...

474
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,500
Mr. Wilson?

475
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,170
Take your time to process this.

476
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,090
It's important not
to do anything rash.

477
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,270
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack

478
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,850
of assholes named
Francis, where would I hide?

479
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,770
Oh.

480
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,210
WADE: A hush
falls over the crowd

481
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,630
as rookie sensation
Wade W. Wilson...

482
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,140
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

483
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,640
His form looks good.

484
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Oh!

485
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,560
And that's why
Regina rhymes with fun.

486
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

487
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,820
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

488
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,280
Oh! Giving him the business.

489
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,780
Incoming!

490
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,660
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

491
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,920
Looking good,
Francis. Well rested.

492
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,670
Like you've been
pitching, not catching.

493
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,170
Ringing any bells? No?

494
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,430
How about now?

495
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,600
Wade fucking Wilson.

496
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,350
FRANCIS: Well, hello, gorgeous.

497
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,360
WADE: Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

498
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,610
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

499
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,700
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

500
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,450
Please, you should thank me.

501
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,810
Apparently, I made you immortal.

502
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm actually quite jealous.

503
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,040
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it?

504
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,790
Now, I'm about to do to you

505
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,210
what Limp Bizkit did
to music in the late 90s.

506
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Dad?

507
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,550
WADE: I think we can all
agree that shit just went sideways

508
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,470
in the most colossal way.

509
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,470
Well, maybe not the most.

510
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,730
WADE: Uh... This is my
most prized possession.

511
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,310
VANESSA: Wham?

512
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,230
No, no, no. Wham!

513
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,190
Make It Big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

514
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,820
So, am I supposed to just smile

515
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,160
and wave you out the door?

516
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,660
Think of it like
spring cleaning.

517
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,070
Only if spring was death.

518
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,580
God, if I had a
nickel for every time

519
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,160
I spanked it to
Bernadette Peters.

520
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,620
Sounds like you do.

521
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,290
Bernadette is not
going anywhere,

522
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,290
because you're
not going anywhere.

523
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Drink.

524
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,020
You're right. Cancer
is only in my liver,

525
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,300
lungs, prostate, and brain.

526
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,620
All things I can live without.

527
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,840
Ha.

528
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,890
You belong here at home.

529
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,430
Surrounded by your Voltron

530
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,600
and your Bernadette,
and your me.

531
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,440
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

532
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,150
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-
opening-for-the

533
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,990
Spin-Doctors-at-the-
Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

534
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,660
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

535
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,660
I want you to remember me.

536
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

537
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,830
Well, I wanna remember us.

538
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,980
I swear to God, I will
find you in the next life...

539
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,090
and I'm gonna boom-box Careless
Whisper outside your window.

540
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,630
Wham!

541
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,010
No one is boom-boxing
shit. Okay?

542
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,020
We can fight this.

543
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,360
Besides, I just
realized something.

544
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,530
You win. Your life is officially

545
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,320
way more fucked up than mine.

546
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
I love you.

547
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,550
Wade.

548
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
Weas.

549
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,470
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

550
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,640
Though courtesy
calls for the latter first.

551
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,350
How about three shots of Patron?

552
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,140
Or how about Triticum
aestivum, wheatgrass.

553
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,560
Excellent for the immune system.

554
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,690
Jesus Christ. You
sound like Vanessa.

555
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,900
Here, check it out.

556
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,360
She's sending away for all
these colorful clinic: Brochures.

557
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

558
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,570
Chechnya. Isn't that
where you go to get cancer?

559
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,490
You got China
and Central Mexico.

560
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,080
You know how they
say "cancer" in Spanish?

561
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,250
No.

562
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,500
El Cancer. Oh.

563
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,420
I could have guessed that.

564
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,300
Look how happy you look here.

565
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,010
Mind if I keep this? Put it up,

566
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,510
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

567
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,890
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

568
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,640
Now that you're gonna
die tragically of cancer.

569
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,510
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

570
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,720
Oh.

571
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,640
And, uh, that guy over
there came in looking for you.

572
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,560
Real Grim Reaper type.

573
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,610
I don't know. Might
further the plot.

574
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Boothe.

575
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,950
Wade.

576
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,250
Mr. Wilson.

577
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,870
How can I help you?

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,580
Besides luring children
into a panel van.

579
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,300
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

580
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,510
Stalker alert.

581
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,760
It's my job. Recruitment.

582
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,930
I'm sorry you've
had such a tough go.

583
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,140
But you're a fighter.
Special Forces.

584
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,720
41 confirmed kills.

585
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,600
One every seven weeks.

586
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,980
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

587
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,980
It's to wash the taste out.

588
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,150
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

589
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,490
And now you spend your days

590
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,490
sticking up for
the little people...

591
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,160
People change. What do you want?

592
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,660
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

593
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,290
What if I told you we
can cure your cancer?

594
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,000
And what's more, give you
abilities most men only dream of?

595
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,470
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

596
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,680
but not a good
one, like Slap Chop.

597
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,350
More Shake Weight-y.

598
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,430
The world needs
extraordinary soldiers.

599
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,600
We won't just make you better.

600
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,690
We will make you
better than better.

601
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,980
A superhero.

602
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,110
Look, Agent Smith,

603
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,320
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

604
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,370
But if I ever hit "fuck
it," I'll look you up.

605
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,330
Oh, um...

606
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,430
Shit. We're within
500 yards of a school,

607
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,660
so you may wanna...

608
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
His drink's on him.

609
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,260
WEASEL: What did he say?

610
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,490
VANESSA: Hey, what's going on?

611
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey. Sorry.

612
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

613
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,830
I dreamt I kidnapped
his daughter

614
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,540
and he just wasn't having it.

615
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,430
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

616
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,600
At some point you have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

617
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,730
Hmm.

618
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,620
i1}WADE: The worst part about
cancer isn't what it does to you...

619
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,910
but what it does to
the people you love.

620
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,710
Who knew if this guy
could save my life...

621
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,460
but I knew there was only
one way that I could save hers.

622
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,930
Isn't that what superheroes do?

623
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,320
WADE: Okay. Let's
pro-con this superhero thing.

624
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,110
Ow.

625
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,110
i1}Pro: They pull down
a gaggle of ass.

626
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,570
Local dry cleaning discounts.

627
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,410
Lucrative film deals,
both origin stories

628
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,620
and larger ensemble team movies.

629
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,540
Con: They're all
lame-ass teacher's pets.

630
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,580
You know, I can hear you.

631
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,540
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

632
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,340
Stay right here.

633
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,090
COLOSSUS: You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

634
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,930
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

635
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,100
You will both be coming with us.

636
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,010
WADE: Look, Colossus,
I don't have time for

637
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
the goody two-shoes
bullshit right now!

638
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,100
And you are?

639
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,480
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

640
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,980
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

641
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,860
That's the coolest name ever!

642
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,950
So, what, you're
like, uh, his sidekick?

643
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,490
No. Trainee.

644
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,990
Let me guess.

645
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,540
X-Men left you behind
on what? Shit detail?

646
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,710
What does that make you?

647
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,170
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

648
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,500
Can we trade names?

649
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,130
Can we go?

650
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,550
WADE: Look! I'm a teenage girl.

651
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,800
I'd rather be
anywhere than here.

652
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,050
I'm all about long
sullen silences...

653
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,640
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

654
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,270
So what's it gonna be,
huh? Long sullen silence...

655
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,890
or mean comment? Go on.

656
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,350
You got me in a box here.

657
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Aha!

658
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,480
We can't allow this, Deadpool

659
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,980
Please, come quietly.

660
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,320
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

661
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,440
COLOSSUS: That's not nice.

662
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,050
You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

663
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,660
Trust me, that wheezing
bag of dick-tips has it coming.

664
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,330
He's pure evil.

665
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,000
Besides... Nobody's
getting hurt.

666
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,420
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

667
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,550
Wade, you are better than this.

668
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,180
Join us. Use your
powers for good.

669
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
WADE: Heads up.

670
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,600
Be a superhero.

671
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
WADE: Listen!

672
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,130
The day I decide to become
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

673
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,520
who rooms with a bunch of other
little whiners at the Neverland mansion...

674
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:45,440
of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

675
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,280
on that day...

676
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,530
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

677
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,120
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

678
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,870
Either that or slap
the bitch outta you!

679
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,210
COLOSSUS: Wade... Hey.

680
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,410
Zip it, Sinéad!

681
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Hey, douche-pool!

682
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,880
And I hope you're watching...

683
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,420
Quite unfortunate.

684
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,050
That does it!

685
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,470
Oh!

686
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,810
Canada!

687
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
That's not good.

688
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,270
COLOSSUS: Wade, please.

689
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,820
WADE: Cock shot!

690
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,940
Oh, your poor wife.

691
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,820
You really should stop.

692
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,830
All the dinosaurs
feared the T. Rex.

693
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,620
WADE: I promise this
gets worse for you, big boy!

694
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,590
This is embarrassing.

695
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,460
Please, stay down.

696
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,980
WADE: You ever hear of the
one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?

697
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,430
Do you have off switch?

698
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,140
Yeah, it's right
next to the prostate.

699
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,300
Or is that the on switch?

700
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,430
Enough!

701
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,860
COLOSSUS: Let us
go talk to the Professor.

702
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,110
McAvoy or Stewart?

703
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,450
These timelines
are so confusing.

704
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,370
"Dead or alive, you're
coming with me!"

705
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,030
COLOSSUS: You
will recover, Wade.

706
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,830
You always do.

707
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,880
You ever see 127
Hours? Spoiler alert.

708
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,720
Oh, my God.

709
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,880
Nasty.

710
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,530
WADE: Oh, there's
the money shot, baby.

711
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,520
Are You There God?
It's Me, Margaret.

712
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,900
i1}WADE: Rock, meet bottom.

713
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,410
And when life ends up
breathtakingly fucked...

714
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,870
you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

715
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,120
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.

716
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,000
This? Well, this was mine.

717
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,250
AGENT SMITH: Mr. Wilson.

718
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,130
Nothing warms my heart more
than a change of someone else's.

719
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,930
You finally hit "fuck it."

720
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Just promise you'll
do right by me.

721
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,770
So I can do right
by someone else.

722
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,060
Of course.

723
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,560
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

724
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,270
Or animated.

725
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,370
MAN: Move it! Keep moving.

726
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,590
This place seems sanitary.

727
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,550
My first request
is warmer hands.

728
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,430
Oh! And, Jesus, a warmer table.

729
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,140
We should really come
up with a safe word, fellas.

730
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm thinking "pork and beans."

731
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,610
Easy.

732
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,820
Aren't you a little
strong for a lady?

733
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm calling Wang.

734
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,120
What's up with the matches?

735
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,120
Oral fixation or just
a big Stallone fan?

736
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,960
Patience, Angel.

737
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,500
All in good time.

738
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,630
Are you here for the
turndown service, or what?

739
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,260
We have another talker.

740
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,320
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

741
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,510
Shut the fuck up.

742
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,770
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

743
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,850
I manage this workshop.

744
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,190
Ah, my welcome speech used
to be full of euphemisms like...

745
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,730
"This may hurt a little."

746
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,820
"This may cause
you some discomfort."

747
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,200
But I've grown blunt.

748
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,860
This workshop is not a
government-led program.

749
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,530
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

750
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,000
into men of
extraordinary abilities.

751
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,880
But if you think super-human
powers are acquired painlessly...

752
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,210
Wrong.

753
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm injecting you
with a serum...

754
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,550
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

755
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,550
For it to work we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

756
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,230
You've heard that whole "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

757
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,520
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

758
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,190
I was a patient here
once myself, you know.

759
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,240
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

760
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,410
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

761
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,750
In my case, it
enhanced my reflexes.

762
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,210
Also soorohed my nerve
endings, so I no longer feel pain.

763
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,750
And, in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

764
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,060
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

765
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,100
You have something
in your teeth.

766
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,190
Right in the middle
there. Just, I don't...

767
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,320
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

768
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,610
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

769
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,110
Ah, made you look.

770
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,030
Hey, is Ajax your actual name?

771
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,830
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

772
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,990
What is it, really?

773
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,330
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

774
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,040
Mitch? The Rickster?

775
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,310
Is it Basil Fawlty?

776
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,130
Oh, joke away.

777
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,940
One thing that never
survives this place

778
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,460
is a sense of humor.

779
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,090
We'll see about that.

780
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,590
I suppose we will.

781
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,510
He's all yours.

782
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, come on.

783
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,720
You're gonna leave
me all alone here

784
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,430
with less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?

785
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,860
i1}FRANCIS: This is
how it's going to work.

786
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,940
Adrenaline acts as a
catalyst for the serum...

787
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,110
so we're going to have
to make you suffer.

788
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,800
i1}FRANCIS: If you're lucky,
the mutant genes will activate

789
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,660
and manifest in a
spectacular fashion.

790
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,750
i1}FRANCE: If not, well, we'll
have to keep on hurting you...

791
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,840
In new and different ways,

792
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,340
each more painful
than the last...

793
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,340
until you finally mutate.

794
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,180
Or die.

795
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,610
CUNNINGHAM: You
mean a bucket list?

796
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,940
WADE: Like a fuck-it list.

797
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,300
I'd really like
to light a spliff

798
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,690
off the Olympic torch.

799
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,110
CUNNINGHAM:
Pass it to me right after.

800
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,620
Let's not forget naked
tandem base-jumping

801
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,160
with the WNBA's
Sacramento Monarchs.

802
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,330
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

803
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,710
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

804
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,170
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

805
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,220
Making banana
pancakes for my kids.

806
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,730
Vanessa.

807
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,570
WADE: I wanna see Vanessa.

808
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,980
FRANCIS: You're lovely.

809
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,450
I don't know about anyone
else, but I'm touched.

810
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,530
We were just joking.

811
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,910
No, no. It's okay.

812
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,740
I encourage distractions.

813
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,830
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us, now would we?

814
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,750
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

815
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,040
How tough can he be...

816
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,090
with a name like Francis?

817
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,760
Francis?

818
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,550
WADE: That's his legal name.

819
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,600
He got "Ajax"
from the dish soap.

820
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,230
F, R, A, N, C, I...

821
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,060
Oops!

822
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,730
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

823
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,030
FYI, I could probably get
you the superhero discount.

824
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,490
You are so
relentlessly annoying.

825
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,570
Thanks.

826
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,870
Never heard that before.

827
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,160
Why don't you do us all a
favor and shut the fuck up?

828
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,250
Or I'll sew your
pretty mouth shut.

829
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,960
Oh...

830
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,620
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

831
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,250
See, here's the problem with

832
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,050
round-the-clock torture...

833
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,090
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

834
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,090
Is that what you think?

835
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,810
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

836
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,980
nothing will.

837
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,620
Now, what we're going to do is

838
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,370
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

839
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,110
to the exact point you
feel like you're suffocating.

840
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,570
If your brainwaves slow,

841
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,490
meaning you're
about to pass out...

842
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,320
then we'll turn up the O2.

843
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,740
If your heart rate slows...

844
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,450
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

845
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,960
we'll turn it back down.

846
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,080
And that's where
we'll leave you.

847
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,290
Right there.

848
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,880
Oh, and I thought you
guys were dicks before.

849
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,340
FRANCIS: You know
the funniest part of this?

850
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,510
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

851
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,810
You. A dishonorable discharge.

852
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,640
Hip-deep in hookers.

853
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,980
You're nothing.

854
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,360
Little secret, Wade.

855
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,020
This workshop doesn't
make superheroes,

856
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,320
we make super-slaves.

857
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,070
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

858
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,160
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

859
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,350
Who knows what
they'll have you doing?

860
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,540
Terrorizing citizens, putting
down freedom fighters.

861
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,540
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

862
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,550
What the fuck is wrong with you?

863
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,510
You're never going
home after this.

864
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,890
Now there's a brave face.

865
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,520
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

866
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,730
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

867
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,030
Enjoy your weekend.

868
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,070
"Weekend"? Back up.

869
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,360
Weekend'?

870
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,120
WADE: Did I say
this was a love story?

871
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,620
No, it's a horror movie.

872
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,220
FRANCIS: Fucking hell.

873
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,470
Looks like someone lost
his shot at Homecoming King.

874
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,600
What have you done to me?

875
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,240
I've merely raised
your stress levels

876
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,980
high enough to
trigger a mutation.

877
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,310
You sadistic fuck!

878
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,480
I've cured you, Wade.

879
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,990
Now your mutated
cells can heal anything.

880
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,820
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

881
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,660
Yeah, I've seen similar
side-effects before.

882
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,000
I could cure them...

883
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,290
but where's the fun in that?

884
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,170
Now, I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

885
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,970
Not because I need to.

886
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,640
Because I want to.

887
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,160
Oh, Well.

888
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,780
Go ahead.

889
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,540
Oh, you smell like shit.

890
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,790
Whoa!

891
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:29,870
ANGEL DUST: Motherfucker.

892
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,710
Hey, hey, hey. It's
all right, it's all right.

893
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,760
I think we owe
him that one, yeah?

894
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,220
You take off. Go on.

895
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,340
Off you go.

896
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,020
Quick question.

897
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,240
What's my name?

898
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,370
Didn't think so.

899
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,000
WADE: Sorry, Francis.
My lips are sealed.

900
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,780
You don't want to kill me.

901
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,200
I'm the only one who
can fix your ugly mug.

902
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,430
What's my name?

903
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,770
CUNNINGHAM: Wade.

904
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:25,170
WADE: I didn't just get
the cure to El cancer...

905
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,340
I got the cure to El everything.

906
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,140
But there was only one thing...

907
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,970
that really mattered.

908
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,380
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.

909
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,510
WOMAN: Oh, that must hurt.

910
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,010
Thank you so much.

911
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,070
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

912
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,570
WOMAN: Look at his face.

913
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,990
MAN: Oh, my God. Poor guy.

914
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,220
FEMALE PEDESTRIAN:
Honey, don't stare.

915
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,410
MALE PEDESTRIAN: Freak.

916
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,100
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

917
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,770
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

918
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,230
Ah, bullshit!

919
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,570
I'm a monster inside and
out. I belong in a fucking circus.

920
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,240
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

921
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,740
Oh! Oh.

922
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,110
Do you like what you see?

923
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,410
No.

924
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,370
You look like an avocado

925
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,790
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

926
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:21,910
Yeah.

927
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,080
Not gently. Like it
was hate-fucking.

928
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,100
There was something
wrong with the relationship...

929
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,960
and that was the only catharsis

930
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,710
that they could find
without violence.

931
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,340
And the only guy who
can fix this fugly mug...

932
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,090
is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

933
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,970
And he's gone. Poof!

934
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,900
Yeah, well you gotta do
something to remedy this...

935
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,010
because as of now,

936
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,810
you only have one
course of action.

937
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,100
Damn straight.

938
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,020
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

939
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,100
What?

940
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,230
Star in your own horror films.

941
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,730
Because you look
like Freddy Krueger

942
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,280
face-fucked a
topographical map of Utah.

943
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,860
Here's what I'm
actually gonna do.

944
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,090
I'm gonna work through his crew

945
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,530
until somebody
gives up Francis...

946
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,990
force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

947
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,700
and fuck the brain hole.

948
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,790
I don't wanna see
that or think of it again.

949
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,680
But the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

950
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,710
Yeah.

951
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,770
That's good. You
should keep it that way.

952
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,500
What, like, wear a mask?

953
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,510
Yes. A very thick
mask. All the time.

954
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,220
I am sorry...

955
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,800
you are haunting.

956
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,890
Your face is the
stuff of nightmares.

957
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,260
Like a testicle with teeth.

958
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,060
You will die alone.

959
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,810
I mean, if you could die.

960
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,350
Ideally, for others' sake.

961
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,650
That'll do.

962
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,730
All you need now is a
suit and a nickname...

963
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,650
like Wade the Wisecracker...

964
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,200
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

965
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,160
Oh, shit.

966
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,820
What?

967
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,580
I put all my money
on you and now...

968
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,140
I just realized I'm never
gonna win the, uh...

969
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,200
Dead pool.

970
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,500
Captain Deadpool...

971
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,420
No, just...

972
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,050
Just Deadpool,
yeah. Just Deadpool.

973
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,220
To you, Mr. Pool.

974
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,510
Deadpool

975
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,120
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

976
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,690
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it.

977
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,860
Where's Francis?

978
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,550
WADE: Where's Francis?

979
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,890
AL: Seltzer water
and lemon for blood.

980
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,060
Or wear red. Dumbass.

981
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,250
WADE: Don't make me ask twice.

982
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,920
Where...

983
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,250
is Francis?

984
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,460
He made me ask twice.

985
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,590
Is the mask muffling my voice?

986
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,760
Where's Francis?

987
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,270
Where the fuck is Francis?

988
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,150
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni.

989
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,530
Where's Francis?

990
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,120
No! Please!

991
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,580
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

992
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,330
Oh! You little spider monkey!

993
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,920
Where... is... Francis?

994
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,260
This is confusing.

995
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,680
Is it sexist to hit you?

996
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,260
Is it more sexist
to not hit you?

997
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,640
I mean, the line
gets real... blurry.

998
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,970
WHERE IS FRANCIS?

999
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,480
Tell me where
your fucking boss is

1000
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,810
or you're gonna die!

1001
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,020
In five minutes!

1002
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,990
Don't hesitate to call me.

1003
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,720
Nice to see you, Jared.

1004
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,350
I'll take the footlong...

1005
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
Fully loaded.

1006
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,200
Whoa, whoa!

1007
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,860
41 confirmed kills.

1008
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,370
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

1009
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Mr. Wilson?

1010
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,370
Ding-ding.

1011
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,370
You're looking very alive.

1012
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,250
Ha! Only on the outside!

1013
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,520
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

1014
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,850
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

1015
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,010
Where's your boss?

1016
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,630
I can tell you exactly...

1017
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,390
Oh, you'll tell me. But first...

1018
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,140
You might wanna
look away for this.

1019
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,510
Now this little piggy went to...

1020
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,890
WADE: Thank you, Agent Smith.

1021
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,570
Taxi!

1022
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,320
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1023
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,880
WADE: And we all
know how this turned out.

1024
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,790
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.

1025
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,590
There. All caught up.

1026
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,430
We're here.

1027
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,430
Sorry about bleeding
in all your garbage.

1028
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,780
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

1029
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
Whoo!

1030
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,490
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed...

1031
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,700
like the kind where
your year-long plan

1032
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,620
ends with the wrong
guy getting dismembered!

1033
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,080
That said, when it comes
time to licking wounds,

1034
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,790
there's no place like home.

1035
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,500
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

1036
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,960
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

1037
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,840
God, I miss cocaine.

1038
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,170
Her.

1039
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,970
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1040
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,680
That's like 16 walls.

1041
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,770
She's like Robin to my Batman,

1042
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:02,520
except she's old,
and black, and blind.

1043
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,360
And I think she's
in love with me.

1044
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,190
WADE: Wait, pretty sure
Robin loves Batman, too.

1045
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,200
WADE: AI?

1046
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,870
Morning, sleepyhead.

1047
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,540
It smells like old
lady pants in here.

1048
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,500
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

1049
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,340
But you're no lady.

1050
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,180
Oh! So comfy.

1051
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,850
Upside of being blind: I've
never seen you in Crocs.

1052
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,370
You mean my big, rubber
masturbating shoes?

1053
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,520
AL: Yes, I know.

1054
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,560
Downside of being blind...

1055
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,900
I hear everything
in this duplex.

1056
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,360
Sit on a stick.

1057
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Bactin?

1058
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:53,700
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

1059
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,490
How's that Kullen coming along?

1060
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,530
IKEA doesn't assemble
itself, you know.

1061
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,540
You're telling me. I
don't mind the Kullen.

1062
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,580
It's an improvement
on the Hurdal.

1063
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,750
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the Hurdal.

1064
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,420
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

1065
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,800
Oh, no, I didn't get
excited till I saw the Kullen.

1066
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,930
Screw, please.

1067
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,390
Here? Now? Just kidding.

1068
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,680
I know it's been decades.

1069
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,890
You'd be surprised.

1070
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,720
Pretty grossed out.

1071
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,100
Ta... Da.

1072
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,070
I wish I never
heard of Craigslist.

1073
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:35,760
And I quote, "Looking
for roommate,

1074
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,030
"blind to life's imperfections.

1075
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,200
"Must be good with hands."

1076
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,490
Or would you rather I build
the IKEA, and you pay rent?

1077
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,450
Why such a douche this morning?

1078
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,330
Let's recap.

1079
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,580
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

1080
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,420
slipped through my arms today...

1081
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,250
Arm.

1082
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,900
Catching him was my only chance

1083
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,840
to be hot again, get
my super sexy ex back...

1084
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,180
and prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1085
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,180
So, yeah, today was
about as much fun

1086
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,970
as a sandpaper dildo.

1087
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,430
♪ Driveby.

1088
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,950
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

1089
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,120
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1090
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,460
I suppose I'd wear a mask
too if I had a face like that.

1091
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,630
I only wish I healed the same.

1092
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,300
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

1093
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,680
On our terms.

1094
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,850
Right. And when he heals?

1095
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,850
He can't.

1096
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,560
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1097
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,650
You know, it's funny. I
almost miss the fucker.

1098
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,480
I like a challenge.

1099
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,860
But he's bad for business.

1100
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,780
Now let's go find him.

1101
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,660
Oh.

1102
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,540
Tylenol PM?

1103
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,210
You can stick that where
you stuck the Bactin.

1104
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,880
I raided my stash of
wisdom tooth Percocet...

1105
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,050
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

1106
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,970
But I appreciate the gesture.

1107
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,180
Am I crazy, or is your
hand really small?

1108
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,140
About the size of a KFC spork.

1109
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:29,390
Ugh.

1110
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,400
I get why you're so pissy...

1111
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,150
but your mood's
never gonna brighten

1112
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:35,400
till you find this woman...

1113
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,860
and tell her how you feel.

1114
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,570
What do I keep telling
you, Mrs. Magoo?

1115
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,240
She wouldn't have me.

1116
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,070
If you could see me,
you'd understand.

1117
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,240
Looks aren't everything.

1118
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,410
Looks are everything.

1119
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,540
You ever heard
David Beckham speak?

1120
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,750
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

1121
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,560
You think Ryan
Reynolds got this far

1122
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,250
on his superior acting method?

1123
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,670
Love is blind, Wade.

1124
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,750
No.

1125
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,170
You're blind.

1126
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,590
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

1127
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,860
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

1128
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:03,950
and then I'm gonna come up with

1129
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,210
a whole new Christmas Day plan.

1130
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,060
In the meantime,

1131
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,520
you might wanna leave the room.

1132
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,560
I bet it feels
huge in this hand.

1133
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,400
GO, go!

1134
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,880
WEASEL: So, the doctor
says, "The bad news is

1135
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,170
"you don't have
that long to live."

1136
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,750
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1137
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,660
The doctor says, "Five."

1138
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,320
The guy says, "Five what?"

1139
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,580
And the doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

1140
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,040
Can I help you ladies?

1141
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:40,760
Oh, I do hope so.

1142
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,430
I heard you might
be able to point me

1143
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:49,100
in the direction of
a, um, friend of mine.

1144
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,640
Name of Wade Wilson.

1145
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,230
Sorry.

1146
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,940
I don't know the name.

1147
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,610
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

1148
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,120
I've seen this girl.

1149
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,610
FRANCIS: Ah, this
must be Vanessa.

1150
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,830
I've heard so much about you.

1151
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,290
Um, sweetheart, you
might wanna look around.

1152
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,510
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1153
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,510
Easy, Angel.

1154
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,090
Put the little man down.

1155
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,430
We have everything we need now.

1156
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,850
You sure?

1157
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,520
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1158
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,360
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade ll.

1159
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,610
Whoo.

1160
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,780
Thanks for having my back, guys.

1161
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,120
Wade, we have a fucking problem.

1162
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,040
And by "we," I mean "you."

1163
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,620
Ah, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1164
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,830
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1165
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,040
Yeah, "afrangry", I guess.

1166
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,010
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1167
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,050
Fuck me!

1168
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,300
Uh, maybe not start with that.

1169
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,350
Hey, coming onto
our stage right now...

1170
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,690
give it up for Chastity!

1171
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,730
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1172
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,900
Better find her fast
before numbnuts does.

1173
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,490
How do you know she's in here?

1174
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,740
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

1175
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,270
WADE: Every time I see
her, it's like the first time...

1176
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,270
Especially from this angle.

1177
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,050
i1}ANNOUNCER: You can't buy love,

1178
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,550
but you can rent it
for three minutes.

1179
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,470
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

1180
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,270
Come on!

1181
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,730
Come on, get it together.

1182
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,810
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1183
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,280
Here we go.

1184
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,490
Maximum effort.

1185
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,120
Vanessa.

1186
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,580
Someone out back asking for you.

1187
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,790
Something about,
uh, an old boyfriend.

1188
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,280
I knew it was you.

1189
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,030
The weird, curvy edges.

1190
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,450
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1191
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,380
You have Wade
Wilson to thank for this.

1192
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,890
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1193
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,890
Uh, I saw her head to the back.

1194
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,390
Go get her, tiger.

1195
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,710
Fuck. Fuck!

1196
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,050
Motherfucker!

1197
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,300
Wait, wait. Lets just

1198
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,390
Cock juggling...

1199
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,530
We can talk about
what we're gonna...

1200
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:38,550
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1201
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,810
Okay, or you can hit that.

1202
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:41,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck! Fuck!

1203
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,140
No, no. All right. Hey!

1204
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,430
Fuck! Fuck!

1205
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,940
Fuck! Hey, um...

1206
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,940
Whoa! Whoa! Relax. Relax. Okay.

1207
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,430
Okay. I think
that's a good start.

1208
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,440
Oh, I'm gonna rip
his motherfucking...

1209
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,570
Wait.

1210
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,150
Find it! Find it. What?

1211
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,680
I'm gonna get
angry. Okay. All right.

1212
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:58,740
All right. Okay. All right.

1213
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,120
Here. This is Vanessa.

1214
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,200
What? No, wait. It's Francis.

1215
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,120
He wants you to come to him.

1216
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,710
What is that?
That's the shit emoji.

1217
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,940
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

1218
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,290
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

1219
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,130
I need guns.

1220
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,300
Okay, which ones?

1221
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,550
I need all the guns!

1222
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,880
All right. Okay.

1223
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,990
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1224
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,990
We all know what
I can do with 12.

1225
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,580
Hey, hey, careful with
that, Ronnie Milsap!

1226
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,790
We're downrange.

1227
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,670
I was gonna spend the night

1228
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,910
assembling the Borje, but
this is holding my interest.

1229
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,760
I told you, we're going
with the Urvaj, not the Borje.

1230
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,760
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1231
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,510
Shit. That's all the
pieces in the house.

1232
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,470
Nah, nah... Come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

1233
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,350
Up, up, Up.

1234
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,770
Oh. Down, down, down.

1235
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,930
Fuck you.

1236
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,520
.45 cal. I like it.

1237
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:14,860
Wade...

1238
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,820
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

1239
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:22,990
Uh...

1240
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,530
Listen, Al...

1241
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,040
if I never see you again,

1242
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,790
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

1243
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:35,460
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

1244
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,860
buried somewhere
in the apartment...

1245
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,670
right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1246
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:46,220
You wanna get fucked up?

1247
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,070
Put her down over here.

1248
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,500
Go on then.

1249
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,500
Thanks, dickless.
And I mean you.

1250
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,170
Wow. You're a talker
too. You and Wade.

1251
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,010
I've been trying to
tell you assholes,

1252
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,510
you've got the wrong girl.

1253
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,050
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1254
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,680
See, I thought that too. But
he keeps on coming back.

1255
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,100
Like a cockroach...

1256
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,600
but uglier.

1257
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,100
Now, I may not
feel, but he does.

1258
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,230
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1259
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,530
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1260
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,950
Fuck, you're old.

1261
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,870
Fakelaugh. Hiding real pain.

1262
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,290
Go get Silver Balls.

1263
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,750
You guys going for a
bite? Early bird special?

1264
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,110
Oh, like there's something wrong

1265
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,770
with eating before
sundown or saving money.

1266
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,130
No, you know that
bad guy that you let go?

1267
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,550
He's got my girl.

1268
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,100
You're gonna help
me get her back.

1269
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,220
COLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?

1270
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,850
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

1271
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:14,770
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1272
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,580
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1273
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,650
It's a big house.

1274
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:20,880
It's funny that I only
ever see two of you.

1275
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,110
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1276
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,180
WADE: And that is
why, in my opinion...

1277
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,410
the movie Cocoon
is pure pornography.

1278
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,580
Who brought this twinkly man?

1279
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,670
Twinkly, but deadly.

1280
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,250
My chrome-penised
friend back there

1281
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,920
has agreed to do me this solid.

1282
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,340
In exchange, I said that I would

1283
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,340
consider joining his boy band.

1284
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:46,680
It's not boy band.

1285
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,930
Sure it's not.

1286
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,930
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1287
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,020
I tried to hold on
tight, Mr. Pool...

1288
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:57,810
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1289
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,190
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

1290
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:07,700
Dopmden Hmm?

1291
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,030
What was that?

1292
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,990
Uh...

1293
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:17,710
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1294
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,630
Ban who?

1295
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:22,460
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1296
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,170
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1297
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,170
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

1298
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,050
then dump 'ms carcass
on Ghats doorstep.

1299
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,010
I did not tell him to do that.

1300
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,770
Absolutely not. It
got lost in translation.

1301
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:37,020
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1302
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,140
I'm so proud of you.

1303
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,360
Drop Bandhu off,
safe and gentle-like.

1304
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,480
Kill him.

1305
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,530
And then, win Gita back...

1306
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,400
the old fashioned way:
With your boyish charm.

1307
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:48,030
Kidnap her.

1308
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,660
He's super dead.

1309
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Whoa!

1310
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,580
I presume a crisp high five?

1311
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,080
For you? 10.

1312
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:03,250
Okay, guys, let's get out
there and make a difference.

1313
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,340
You know what to do.

1314
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,880
Knock 'em dead, PoolBoy!

1315
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,100
Time to make the
chimi-fuckin'-changas.

1316

WADE: Not often a
dude ruins your face...

grabs your future baby mama...

1318
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,890

1319
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,400
of your five shittiest moments.

1320

Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

Superhero landing.

1334

She's gonna do a
superhero landing.

1335
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,690
Wait for it.

1336

WADE; Whoo!

Superhero landing!

You know, that's really
hard on your knees.

Totally impractical.
They all do it.

You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

1341

That's why I brought him.

I prefer not to hit a
woman, so please...

1343

I mean, that's
why I brought her?

Oh, no, finish your
tweet. It's not... That's...

Just give us a second. Yeah.

There you go. Hashtag it.

Go get her, tiger.

Oh, I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

All right, then. Fire!

1350

Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1351
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,340
Language, please.

1352
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:50,590
Suck a cock.

01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,280
Look away, child.

So, I'mma give you a chance

for y'all to lay down
your firearms...

Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since TGI Fridays.

that tuna casserole?

So good. But bad
for the waistline,

I'm talking about.

Your... On the left. You

Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1455
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,780
that really matter.

1456
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,580
Moments when
you're offered a choice.

1457
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:15,370
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1458
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,920
save a friend...

1459
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,130
spare an enemy.

1460
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,130
In these moments...

1461
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,800
everything else falls away.

1462
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,970
The way the world sees us.

1463
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:30,430
The way we...

1464
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,770
Why?

1465
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,810
You were droning on.

1466
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:41,940
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1467
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,900
but at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1468
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:47,780
If wearing superhero tights...

1469
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,570
means sparing psychopaths...

1470
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:51,780
then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1471
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:54,250
Not everyone
monitors a hall like you.

1472
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:55,410
Just promise...

1473
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,080
Yeah, yeah, I'll
be on the lookout

1474
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,330
for the next four moments.

1475
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:00,960
Oh, shit.

1476
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,760
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm just a boy,

1477
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,970
about to stand
in front of a girl...

1478
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,340
and tell her...

1479
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,510
What the fuck am
I gonna tell her?

1480
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:13,850
Well, hmm, you
better figure it out.

1481
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,630
I can't even tell you...

1482
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,770
I deserved that. That, too.

1483
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,100
No, no, no, maybe
not the nethers.

1484
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:22,110
Start talking!

1485
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,690
I'm sorry.

1486
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,440
I'm so sorry.

1487
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,820
For everything, I'm
sorry for leaving...

1488
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,290
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1489
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:36,120
It's been rough couple of years.

1490
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,200
Rough?

1491
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,880
I live in a crackhouse.

1492
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:49,470
With a family of 12.

1493
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,720
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1494
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,720
Everybody fights for
Noelle. She's the fattest.

1495
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,470
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1496
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,730
Floor space, dental
floss, even condoms.

1497
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,030
So, you live in a house.

1498
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,830
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1499
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,610
But, baby, the guy
under this mask,

1500
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:29,260
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1501
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:34,850
You mean this mask?

1502
01:37:54,950 --> 01:37:56,580
And this one.

1503
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,790
In case the other fell off.

1504
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,960
All right. Yeah, just... Ow.

1505
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,710
Like a Band-Aid,
just give it a...

1506
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,960
Owdie 5,000.

1507
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,130
Wait, wait, wait...

1508
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:13,300
Are you sure?

1509
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,140
I'm sure.

1510
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,480
Wow.

1511
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,980
Yeah.

1512
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,280
Hey.

1513
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:42,290
After a brief
adjustment period...

1514
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:44,750
and a bunch of drinks...

1515
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,130
it's a face...

1516
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,170
I'd be happy to sit on.

1517
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:05,100
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1518
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,190
No.

1519
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,520
Super-penis.

1520
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:10,650
COLOSSUS: Come
on, Wade. Language.

1521
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,280
Young one is present.

1522
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,200
What are you still doing?

1523
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,950
Get out of here. Go
make yourself useful!

1524
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:20,780
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1525
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,540
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1526
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,460
And you, chicken noodle...

1527
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,370
Nothing compares to you.

1528
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,540
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1529
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,300
That's all right. You're cool.

1530
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,840
What in the ass?

1531
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:38,050
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1532
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:41,510
We will make an
X-Man of you yet, Wade.

1533
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,890
For a second there,

1534
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,820
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1535
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:47,060
coming together to
form one super robot.

1536
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,060
There's a stupid.

1537
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:50,230
Yeah.

1538
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:58,070
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1539
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:02,910
Come here.

1540
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,760
Wham! As promised.

1541
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:29,940
WADE: See?

1542
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:33,610
You don't need to be a
superhero to get the girl.

1543
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:36,440
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

1544
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:40,450
Now, let's finish this
epic wide shot. Pull out.

1545
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,120
There we go, that looks nice.

1546
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,380
That's gonna be
about the only thing

1547
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,700
that's pulling out tonight.

1548
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:47,960
Who doesn't love a
happy ending, huh?

1549
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,540
'Til next time, this is

1550
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,880
your friendly neighborhood
pool guy singin'. ..

1551
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,210
I'm never gonna dance again

1552
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:57,800
The way I danced with you

1553
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:07,850
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

1554
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:09,340
You're still here?

1555
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,970
It's over. Go home.

1556
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,180
Oh, you're expecting a
teaser for Deadpool 2.

1557
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,100
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1558
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:24,940
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1559
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,690
With an eye patch and a
saucy little leather number?

1560
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:29,440
Go. Go.

1561
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:35,690
Oh.

1562
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:38,280
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1563
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:41,450
For the sequel, we're
gonna have Cable.

1564
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:43,950
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1565
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,180
We have no idea who
we're gonna cast yet,

1566
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:46,290
but it could be anybody.

1567
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:47,870
Just need a big
guy with a flat top.

1568
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,630
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren...

1569
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:52,130
Keira Knightley. She's
got range. Who knows.

1570
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,630
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1571
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:55,670
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1572
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:58,180
It's a total dick move.

1573
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,220
Go.
