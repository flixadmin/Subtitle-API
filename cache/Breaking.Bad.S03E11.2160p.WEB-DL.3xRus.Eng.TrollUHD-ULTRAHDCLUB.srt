1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,181
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,355
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:29,195
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,700
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,788
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,500
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:48,131
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,134
It's who she was.

9
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,388
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,515
This chick have medical issues?

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,935
This particular painting

12
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,021
is of a door.

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,901
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,904
Like, real ones or...?

15
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,450
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,578
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,082
over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,835
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,713
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,466
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,219
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,389
And that's not psycho to you?

23
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,683
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,395
Should I just smoke this one cigarette?

25
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,148
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,069
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,364
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,159
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,745
Okay, fine.

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:06,626
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,673
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,219
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something,

33
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,680
and you might not even get why.

34
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,391
You open yourself up and go with the flow

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,185
wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:29,065
Okay, so the universe took her to a door.

37
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:34,154
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,072
until it was perfect.

39
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,491
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,911
Yeah? Well

41
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,456
I mean

42
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,083
some things.

43
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,018
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,610
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over

46
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,030
until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,242
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,371
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

49
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,700
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,873
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,382
{\an8}Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,008
{\an8}You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,638
{\an8}Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,807
{\an8}Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,102
{\an8}- If you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

56
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,647
{\an8}Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,693
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,240
{\an8}- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,535
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,205
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,418
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,170
{\an8}Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,298
{\an8}It's all right.

64
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,138
{\an8}I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,225
{\an8}Gonna get me out of here sometime today?

66
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,062
Sky?

67
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,653
{\an8}We got our first bill, and,
you know, if you're still insistent...

68
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,614
{\an8}I am.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,122
{\an8}Prepare yourself.

70
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,798
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

71
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,011
You're sure you can do this?

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,973
{\an8}Yeah.

73
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,220
{\an8}I'll do that.

74
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,558
{\an8}What the hell, man?

75
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,812
{\an8}What, I can't work a scale now?

76
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,024
This is bullshit. Just say it.

77
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,609
Just say the words.

78
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,070
You think I'm stealing.

79
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,462
{\an8}Walk with who you are.

80
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,674
{\an8}That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me

81
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,510
{\an8}back when I first started
coming to meetings.

82
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,597
{\an8}It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

83
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:17,437
{\an8}But this idea of "walk" also tells me

84
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,733
{\an8}that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,654
{\an8}I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

86
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,700
See some hands? First time?

87
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,126
Great. Welcome.

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,795
{\an8}Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

89
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,089
{\an8}Say whatever's on your mind.

90
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,009
{\an8}How about you?
You wanna start us off?

91
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,390
{\an8}Yeah. My name is Andrea...

92
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,856
{\an8}We don't bite. No judgments.

93
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,276
{\an8}You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

94
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,615
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

95
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,497
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

96
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,004
Hey, what's up?

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,340
My name's Jesse.

98
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,636
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

99
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,889
And this is, I believe, Peter?

100
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,934
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

101
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,362
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

102
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,989
It's gonna get slower smuggling product

103
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,742
with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

104
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,870
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

105
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,414
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,793
So how's it selling?

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,461
Mad volume?

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,256
Yeah, it's...

109
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,883
You know, it's...

110
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,469
It's not so good.

111
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,223
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

112
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,684
I sold a teenth.

113
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,146
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,439
To who?

115
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,859
To him.

116
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,781
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

117
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,451
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

118
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

119
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,041
and you're too pussy to sell?

120
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,003
You're pathetic.

121
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,590
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

122
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,135
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

123
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,930
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

124
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,349
It's not so easy like you think.

125
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:05,479
I will show you exactly how easy it is.

126
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,943
- Thank you.
- All right.

127
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,029
See you next week.

128
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,667
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

129
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
Andrea, right?

130
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,007
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse,

131
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:38,137
and I don't really wanna be here either.

132
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,018
Sorry.

133
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,919
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

134
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,837
No.

135
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,381
Your dad is.

136
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,889
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

137
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,141
Are you that boring?

138
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,977
I'm comforting.

139
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,731
I'm a comforting presence.

140
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,743
Hey, so check it out.

141
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,121
See what that means?

142
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,330
Check out the date.

143
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:51,044
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

144
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:57,300
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

145
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,971
You don't turn 16 for two more months.

146
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,598
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

147
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,726
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

148
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,812
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

149
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,232
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

150
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,611
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

151
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,491
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.

152
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,036
A 'Stang.

153
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,498
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

154
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,793
Makes a nice motory sound, you know?

155
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,007
Dad, you're not gonna get off that easy.

156
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,178
Well, I think that this is...

157
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,848
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

158
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,643
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

159
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,562
Okay.

160
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,108
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

161
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,863
in Grabber Lime with a shaker hood.

162
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,406
'Stang.

163
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:06,953
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

164
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,148
What is "Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

165
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,111
It's a loan out, it's fine.

166
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,280
Whose loan out?

167
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,158
It's fine. Really.

168
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,827
I...

169
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,579
...have a guy.

170
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,415
Okay.

171
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,670
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

172
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,966
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

173
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,927
Yes. My guy is a top

174
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,804
- guy.
- Who is he?

175
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,556
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

176
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:14,145
Walt, this money has to be unimpeachable

177
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,815
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

178
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,401
And it is. It will be.

179
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,780
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

180
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,242
Jesus, Skyler, do you really wanna know?

181
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,994
Do you really wanna know?

182
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,749
Really?

183
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,119
What a pleasure it is to have you.

184
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,664
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

185
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,209
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

186
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:23,048
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate events.

187
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,301
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers

188
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:30,096
only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

189
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,061
That's a joke. That's a joke.

190
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,855
It's funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

191
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,608
Here, please, sit down.

192
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:47,113
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

193
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,574
Yes, I do. I have

194
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,535
concerns.

195
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,205
If we're going to go down this road,

196
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,458
and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

197
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,754
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

198
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,093
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this

199
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,763
in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

200
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,891
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

201
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:19,396
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

202
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,525
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

203
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,236
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

204
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,613
I know what money laundering is.

205
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,325
- Well.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,371
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

207
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,959
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

208
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,710
That's simple.

209
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,132
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

210
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,717
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

211
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,303
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

212
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,475
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

213
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,144
There you have it.

214
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,523
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo

215
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,236
as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers

216
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,406
who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

217
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,116
It's a win-win for everyone.

218
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,952
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

219
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,705
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

220
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,541
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion

221
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,588
then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

222
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,631
Investment in what?

223
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,633
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

224
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,927
Laser tag.

225
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,974
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun

226
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,643
in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

227
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,688
Laser tag?

228
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,026
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

229
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,070
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

230
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,324
It's just that in relation to Walt,
it's...

231
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,535
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

232
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,289
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

233
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,710
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people

234
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,631
buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

235
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,052
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

236
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,471
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

237
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,014
"Hey, everybody

238
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:23,144
Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue."

239
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,899
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends

240
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,484
the government?

241
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,488
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

242
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,032
I've been doing this for a lot of years

243
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,118
successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

244
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,457
So thank you for stopping by.

245
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,310
You want a beer or something?

246
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,063
Or something?

247
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,023
What do you mean?

248
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,277
Like, beer.

249
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,029
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

250
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:21,035
Even if I wasn't, we're not supposed to.

251
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,204
Yeah.

252
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:30,128
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

253
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,632
You know, don't you think it's ridiculous

254
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,511
that society says beer is okay,

255
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:43,391
and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

256
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,855
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely

257
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,734
from something
that lifts you off the ground?

258
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:02,403
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use,

259
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,331
and I feel like crap because of it.

260
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,671
- I know, it's just...
- What?

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,093
I can't get caught using again.

262
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,183
See, the thing is

263
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,854
not to get caught.

264
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,401
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

265
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,699
Just a little gas in the tank,

266
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:46,954
and suddenly everything is interesting.

267
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,418
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

268
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,093
Like I said, I got nothing here.

269
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,057
What if I could get some?

270
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,233
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

271
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,444
Your nana brought you home early.

272
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,366
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

273
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,577
I was, then I saw your car.

274
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,790
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

275
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,127
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

276
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,381
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.

277
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,191
Jesse, this is Brock.

278
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,363
So you have a kid, huh?

279
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,031
What's up?

280
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,492
Brock, huh?

281
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,203
That's a cool name.

282
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,999
Here, give it up.

283
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,513
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

284
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,641
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

285
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,938
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

286
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,150
He's gonna go play with his Legos
and his cars.

287
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,235
- Say, "Bye, Jesse."
- Bye, Jesse.

288
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,906
Hope you had a good time at Grandma's.

289
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,408
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

290
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,743
The convertible one?

291
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,622
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

292
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:57,752
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man

293
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,462
is neither.

294
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,800
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown,

295
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,885
but he knows what he's doing.

296
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,555
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

297
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,766
Well, it's a little late on that.

298
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,853
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

299
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,527
Skyler

300
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,531
this isn't just about
what happened before.

301
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,496
My involvement in this is ongoing.

302
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,457
Understand?

303
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,502
I can't just quit.

304
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,049
I have something of a contract.

305
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,219
But it's all very safe, professional.

306
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,429
Structured.

307
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,348
Like, I can't simply quit.

308
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,110
Where you going?

309
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,587
If you're gonna launder money, Walt

310
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,631
at least do it right.

311
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,277
You worked here four years.

312
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,571
It's a business you understand.

313
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,990
It's a story people will believe.

314
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,492
Not laser tag, this.

315
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,787
This is what we buy.

316
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,081
You.

317
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,417
This is what you buy.

318
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:28,819
Yeah, I mean, there's free doughnuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free doughnut.

319
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,660
Hey, Jesse, right?

320
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,788
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

321
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,998
Can we please, just...?

322
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,291
Dumb-ass.

323
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,003
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the DL.

324
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,258
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

325
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,218
Do what?

326
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,929
You know, sell to her?

327
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,600
What are you two even doing here?

328
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,603
What do you mean?

329
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,233
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,069
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

331
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,488
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

332
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,706
Whatever. Later.

333
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,960
Hey.

334
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,839
Dude needs to come into the fold.

335
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,008
Yup.

336
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,473
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

337
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,183
You wanna see?

338
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,936
Ready?

339
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,441
That's not real.

340
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,611
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

341
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,404
Look at this. Watch this.

342
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,907
Ready?

343
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,915
You like that?

344
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,919
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

345
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,130
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

346
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,133
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

347
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,886
Could you do a trick with firecrackers?

348
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,347
Firecrackers?

349
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,226
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

350
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,687
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

351
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,150
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

352
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,945
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

353
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,821
And we don't talk about him.

354
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,700
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

355
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,081
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

356
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,999
Hey, that's mine.

357
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,254
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

358
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,215
People will believe it, at least.

359
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,509
I worked here for four years.

360
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,011
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

361
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,390
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

362
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,725
I explicitly say, "No air freshener",

363
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,021
and every time, I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

364
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,526
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

365
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,862
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

366
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,490
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

367
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:25,453
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

368
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,541
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

369
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,336
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

370
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,339
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner,

371
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,718
and it worked because I believed it,
all right?

372
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,053
Has nothing to do with the story.

373
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,308
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

374
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,767
There's no Danny here.

375
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,896
What in God's name is a Danny?

376
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,234
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

377
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,031
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens

378
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,867
teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

379
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,827
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

380
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,456
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble

381
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:13,460
he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

382
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,631
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

383
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,676
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

384
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:27,432
That guy, the guy with the eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

385
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:32,020
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

386
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,523
You got no Danny here.

387
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,079
You wanna stay for dinner?

388
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,872
Yeah.

389
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,957
Thanks.

390
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,460
What time is it?

391
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,047
Early still.

392
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,177
So...

393
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,431
What?

394
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:14,938
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

395
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,941
What?

396
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,070
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

397
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,115
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

398
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,077
What?

399
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,038
Thought you said the kid is coming home.

400
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,208
Yeah, in a few hours.

401
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,627
And you seriously wanna get high?

402
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,922
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

403
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,383
You're the one who brought it up.

404
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,262
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

405
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,389
What kind of mother are you?

406
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
What?

407
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,019
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

408
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,569
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

409
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,696
You come in my house and judge me?

410
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,116
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

411
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,701
What do you know about me?

412
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,537
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

413
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,040
The day Brock was born, I swore

414
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,128
I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

415
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,923
I'll die first.

416
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,885
Sorry. I...

417
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,554
I just...

418
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,061
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

419
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,147
That's what you wanna do, then go.

420
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
It's not what I want.

421
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,445
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

422
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,083
We both were.

423
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,213
You're right

424
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,674
I don't know what you've been through.

425
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,177
You can tell me if you want.

426
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,100
This whole neighborhood's run by gangs.

427
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,438
They run the drugs, control the streets.

428
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,069
They sort of took Tomas in.

429
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,738
No dad around.

430
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,075
Eight years old

431
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,119
they got Tomas slinging.

432
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,872
Part of some crew.

433
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,418
Then when he was 10,

434
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,840
for some initiation or something

435
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,426
they made him kill somebody.

436
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,600
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

437
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,397
But then I saw him like a week later.

438
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,279
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

439
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,366
They gave Tomas a gun.

440
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,327
Gave him a choice.

441
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,414
Him or some dude.

442
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,709
So he did it.

443
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,171
Told me all about it like it was nothing.

444
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,842
Who did he say he killed?

445
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,761
Some dealer.

446
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,141
From some outside crew.

447
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,062
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

448
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,152
Just rode up on his bike and shot him.

449
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,949
Off of Central?

450
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,203
Like over by the train tracks?

451
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,166
When was this?

452
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,628
Few months back.

453
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,009
What else did he tell you?

454
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,725
He shot the guy right through the neck.

455
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,895
Shot him dead.

456
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,234
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

457
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,117
It won't happen again.

458
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,037
Not to my son.

459
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,515
Guess what.

460
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,104
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess

461
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,106
I hate those people.

462
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,941
Well, I just heard

463
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,863
about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank

464
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,450
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

465
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,453
Isn't that fantastic?

466
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,998
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

467
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,377
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

468
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,170
Hey.

469
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,424
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

470
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,720
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

471
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:43,350
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

472
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,270
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

473
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,481
You don't need to be in a hospital.

474
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,734
In this condition, yeah, I do.

475
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,821
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

476
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,866
- You'll have all the same equipment.
- Same equipment? What's that mean?

477
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,954
The equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

478
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,207
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great

479
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,168
because you'll be home.

480
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,713
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

481
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,007
I know that's how you always wanted it.

482
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,802
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

483
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,347
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

484
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,307
Well...

485
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,185
You put a hospital bed in my bedroom?

486
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,146
Hank

487
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,897
you'll be home.

488
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,067
You get that out of my house.

489
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,236
You hear me, Marie?

490
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,821
Today.

491
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,450
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital

492
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,454
when I walk out of here.
You understand?

493
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,207
And not before.

494
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,837
What's a Danny?

495
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,839
Danny's an accomplice.

496
00:36:56,006 --> 00:37:00,760
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering

497
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,388
who's paid to look the other way.

498
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,643
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell

499
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,606
without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

500
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,027
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

501
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,905
Easier said than done.

502
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,366
If we're looking for someone trustworthy.

503
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,923
What about me?

504
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,761
What about you?

505
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,388
Me.

506
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,308
I'll be the Danny.

507
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,937
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

508
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,397
I'm capable of managing a small business.

509
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,233
A legal business, not this.

510
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,859
Who else could we trust?

511
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,070
- No.
- Walt

512
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,947
I'm in this.

513
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,116
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

514
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,287
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

515
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,957
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

516
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,676
Right?

517
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,850
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

518
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:39,150
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

519
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,572
So there's that.

520
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,516
Jesse. Jesse.

521
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,935
Respirator.

522
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,147
Right.

523
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,002
Yes?

524
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,221
Yes, all right. Okay.

525
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,266
Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,437
What was that?

527
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,524
An invitation.

528
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,088
Walter, you're right on time.

529
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,423
Please, come in.

530
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,393
I hope you like paila marina.

531
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,270
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

532
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:45,318
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

533
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,326
Come on. You can help me cook.

534
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,500
This is a Chilean dish that I love,

535
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,169
but I never get to make it.

536
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,505
Kids won't eat it.

537
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,258
But

538
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,844
you know how that is.

539
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,680
Sure.

540
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,977
Do you mind?

541
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,689
Would you slice the garlic?

542
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,484
Very thin.

543
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,828
Why did you invite me here?

544
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,373
We're working together

545
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,876
why not break bread together?

546
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,380
Now, the garlic?

547
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,401
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

548
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,905
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

549
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,909
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

550
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,244
I mean, not very much at all.

551
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:23,833
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal

552
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,337
instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

553
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,797
How is that possible?

554
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,425
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

555
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,388
Neural connections are formed.

556
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:43,144
The senses make the neurons
express signals

557
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:48,358
that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

558
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,819
Where memory is stored.

559
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,574
It's something called relational memory.

560
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,205
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

561
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,250
I'm rusty on my biology.

562
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,710
That's very interesting.

563
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,507
Walter

564
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,134
I would like to help you, if I could.

565
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,180
Help me how?

566
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,892
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,979
More than I care to admit.

568
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,607
I wish I'd had someone to advise me

569
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,528
because this life of ours

570
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,531
it can overwhelm.

571
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,288
You are a wealthy man now.

572
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,833
And one must learn to be rich.

573
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,336
To be poor, anyone can manage.

574
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,301
What advice do you have for me?

575
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,681
Never make the same mistake twice.

576
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,224
Hey.

577
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,518
What's up?

578
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,688
You...? You Tomas?

579
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,732
I heard you were the man.

580
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,692
Yeah, what you want?

581
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,948
Crystal.

582
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,200
You think you could hook me up?

583
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,120
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

584
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,455
Shit, come on, yo.

585
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,792
Three hundred.

586
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,107
Hey, what's up?

587
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,326
Hey, yo.

588
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,640
Bounce.
