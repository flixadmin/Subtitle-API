1
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,375
What the...

2
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,125
Bhuvan idiot, I told you
take care of pan cakes

3
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,125
Hey Bhuvan... Bhuvan... You... Idiot

4
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:54,875
Have it.

5
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,166
I am waking you up since half an hour...

6
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,416
I told you when I was going

7
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,083
for the Shower to take
care of the pancakes

8
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,625
but you are sleeping carelessly here.

9
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,541
Idiot, What if it would
have caught the fire...

10
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,541
You never bother until it's too late.

11
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,833
What is wrong with you
at this time in the morning.

12
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,833
I'll burn you with this.

13
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,583
Hey... Stay away... I'll take a revenge

14
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,291
Whatever

15
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,416
Now you have this

16
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,583
Give me a cigarette

17
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,291
No

18
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,500
Please Give me a cigarette

19
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,000
Get ready we have to go for the Delivery

20
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,375
Ahhh... It burns

21
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,708
please Give me a cigarette

22
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,916
In the bathroom

23
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,375
Blow some air on the wound

24
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,791
Let's go, I'm ready.

25
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,666
Sorry, I was hungry

26
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,583
What's wrong with you!

27
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,416
Alright, so I see here you
dropped out of college

28
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,958
for one year.
Can you explain that?

29
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,041
Yes, that's because I had
a serious accident.

30
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,750
I was in coma for around 2 months.

31
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,958
So missed final examination.

32
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,583
Sorry to hear that.

33
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,125
So, I appreciate your time
today to speaking with me,

34
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,500
the interview will be conducted as part
of the university's precast process.

35
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,416
So, during the precast process
we make sure that

36
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,666
the applicant meets our visa
requirements before getting the CAA.

37
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,583
Is everything ok Trisha?

38
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,125
Aa, Yes everything is fine.

39
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,291
Ok... So, moving further,

40
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,541
this check includes reviewing
financial evidence,

41
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,041
your supporting documents

42
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,250
and assessing your general needs
to do this course.

43
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,125
I think someone is in your room

44
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,625
Yes, Jack.

45
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,333
Jack, can you just hold for a second?

46
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:05,708
Sorry.

47
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,750
What's happening?

48
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:07,666
I did not expect that.

49
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,125
Dad, I have an interview going on. Just go

50
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,041
Hey, what are you doing?

51
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,375
- Who is he?
- Dad, It's an interview, You move

52
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,291
What's going on?

53
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,208
Dad

54
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,541
- My Goodness!
- Hey!

55
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,041
Wohoo, Hi there.

56
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,750
Hey, don't do this, please

57
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,666
Hello, I'm Anant. Trisha's Dad.

58
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,333
Hi Anant.

59
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,208
I am Jack Stanlow. Nice to meet you.

60
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,791
I am so sorry Jack, I am So sorry.
Dad, Dad, Move

61
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,583
Please, let me talk to
this gentleman, please.

62
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,500
Sorry, This is very-very embarrassing.

63
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,750
- Dad, this is embarrassing just go.
- Aa aa, Jack I want to talk to you only.

64
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,708
Please ask her not to interrupt.

65
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,791
It's ok Trisha.

66
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,916
Hey, listen to what he said.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,666
It's okay.

68
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,166
Okay, so quiet now. Don't disturb.

69
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,250
So, you are interviewing
my daughter, right.

70
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,375
Yes

71
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,833
Is she qualified enough to
join your university?

72
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,458
- Move
- Well, we have just started

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
- Move
- Ouch.

74
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,500
She hits me. It Hurts.

75
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,291
I tell you. She is a very aggressive girl.

76
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,250
- Dad why are you, please dad please.
- Of course, you don't know that.

77
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:13,791
Jack, I want a little
Favour from your side

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,125
Okay, I am listening.

79
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,166
What favour!

80
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,750
I love my daughter very much,

81
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:25,208
I don't want her to go away
from me for four long years.

82
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,291
- Okay
- Dad, no

83
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,625
Can you please

84
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,000
- Dad, no
- Reject her?

85
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:29,583
- No
- Well

86
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,041
DAD!

87
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,166
Hey, I was talking to him

88
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,625
Hello, Hello. What's the password?

89
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,041
And he started dancing in the background

90
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,333
Can you believe it?

91
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,583
Now whatever I do, even if I Say sorry.

92
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,500
If they give me clearance
as well I won't be able to go.

93
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,416
People will make fun of me there.

94
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,916
Aren't you ashamed?

95
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,041
Nope

96
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,666
You are also involved in this?

97
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,500
I came to give this,
He told me to sit for sometime,

98
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,708
Told me that Trisha is
going to be rejected,

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,166
So she'll need your support,

100
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,416
I didn't know he was going to dance
behind and get you rejected.

101
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,833
Dad, You ruined my career.

102
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,833
Dear, Family is more important or career?

103
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,250
I can not believe you just said that.

104
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,208
Please understand, my dear.

105
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,458
Once you marry, you'll leave home.

106
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:27,041
And now you want to leave me
for four more years.

107
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,041
My dear.

108
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:35,125
Please, stay here with me until then.

109
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,958
Please, don't go.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,458
Sorry!

111
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,583
Trisha, please.

112
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,375
This is not done.

113
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,541
Listen

114
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,458
Hey, Trisha listen to me.

115
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,541
Hey Trishu, dear.

116
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,666
She got a little too upset, no?

117
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,833
Dad,

118
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,250
you are so going to regret this.

119
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,458
hums song

120
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,750

121
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250

00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,125

129
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,666
Wohoo!

130
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,750
Tell them we don't want to do
any sort of business with you!

131
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,000
From day one, the project is in loss.

132
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,000
It's just big.

133
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,083
Where dear?

134
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,000
Yashvant's birthday

135
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,583
I'll get back to you in a while.

136
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,541
Come here dear!

137
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,291
Birthday party means,

138
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,166
Booze right?

139
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,583
Hmm

140
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,833
Why do you have to do this, dear!

141
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,041
Not in Gujarat, Do whatever you
want to but not here!

142
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,875
If you get caught you'll be in the news.

143
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,583
Headlines will be, "Police raid in party
of alcoholic youngsters",

144
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,708
"Alcohol flows freely in the party of the
sons and the daughters of moneylenders"

145
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,833
blah, blah, blah.

146
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,791
No one is going to say that
it was a bunch of friends

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,458
who were enjoying a birthday party.

148
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,666
Try and understand dear.

149
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,541
I have no issue with you enjoying
yourselves, just not within Gujarat.

150
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,416
Feel free to do whatever you
want outside of the state.

151
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,375
I was going only but you didn't let me go.

152
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,958
Now bear with it.

153
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,250
Please, don't do it dear!

154
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,416
I'll give your number in case
of any legal trouble.

155
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,083
Take care of it.

156
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,958
Hey! Trishu

157
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,166
What time is it?

158
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,958
Eight O'clock.

159
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,416
(Asks for cigarette) Give it to me.

160
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,333
Idiot!

161
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,916
Told you, I'll take revenge.

162
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
Idiot, I burnt my mouth
with that cigarette

163
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,500
Give me some water!

164
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,583
We don't have it.

165
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,583
I need water.

166
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,333
Sit now.

167
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,833
Stop at a nearby parlour.

168
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,125
It hurts like hell, dude!

169
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,083
Same here.

170
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,500
I got the stuff. Let's go.

171
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,625
Hello. Yes, man I am waiting.

172
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,541
Where are you?

173
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,208
Be quick. Please.
Yeah, okay.

174
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,875
Today was a tough day sir!

175
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,791
We got the worst of it from S.P. sir.

176
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,333
What happened?

177
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,000
Digvijay is here.

178
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,166
Sir, do you need something?

179
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,333
I am coming.

180
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,875
Sir, Vishal.

181
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

182
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,333
Catch him. Catch him.

183
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,541
Catch him. Catch him.

184
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,166
Hey Virendra, start the bike quickly.

185
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,375
Yeah, but...

186
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,291
Come on start the bike.

187
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,541
It's not starting.

188
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,041
What!

189
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,541
Let them go! They have escaped now.

190
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,333
- Insert the key, man!
- Bike wasn't starting!

191
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,208
Get installed the kick first!

192
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,250
It is a self-start.

193
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,000
Call the client

194
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,083
Here, Talk to him.

195
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,750
Hello, man. Change of plans now.

196
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,208
I am sharing a new location,
please be there!

197
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,250
Okay!

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,458
Hello, Yeah, blue mercedes 8353, right?

199
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,625
I am right behind you.
Just coming over there!

200
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Give it to me.

201
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
Shall I put the bottles down?

202
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,000
Hmm, put them there.

203
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,166
Thirty-five. It's five short!

204
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,541
You'll give me the discount, no!

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,666
Premium alcohol does not
come with a discount!

206
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,125
It is more than enough, bro!

207
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,208
If you can not afford it then
buy cheaper liquor instead,

208
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,083
There are at least 500 bootleggers
in Ahmedabad!

209
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,166
Afford, really? Do you even know
who you are talking to?

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,541
I am talking to the one
who is asking for a discount!

211
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:39,166
Hey. Nice one, bro.
I liked it, I liked it.

212
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,708
Take it. It's more than five. Have fun.

213
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,250
- Thank you!
- Yo!

214
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,625
Enjoy!

215
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,125
Hmm.

216
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,166
Hey, why do you keep
following up with him?

217
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,833
I am the one dealing with him, right?

218
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,208
Yes, if both of us follow up,
he won't do it.

219
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,625
Hey, Happy Birthday.

220
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,833
- Dude, what are you doing!
- Thank you.

221
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,625
No-no, not to you!

222
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:58,791
Happy Birthday.

223
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,291
Thank you.

224
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,750
- Yes, Don't worry, I will talk to him.
- Hey, Let's go.

225
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,833
- He will be on calls only.
- Yes, I will.

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,750
Yashvant, The bluetooth is not connecting.

227
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,291
Dude, you can't even
connect the bluetooth!

228
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,500
- Yo girl!
- Let me take a look!

229
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,291
Dude I tried a lot but
it's not connecting!

230
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,083
- Hey golu, golu, golu, golu, golu, golu.
- Hey, stop hitting me, Stop.

231
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,875
And don't golu me! I reduced
2 kilograms of my weight!

232
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,708
Don't you dare to reduce the weight!

233
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,083
Ouch, stay away. It hurts.

234
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,541
Don't lose weight then!

235
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,250
You look good.

236
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,416
Is it so. Tell her then.

237
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,041
Guys!

238
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,458
Let's cut the cake first!

239
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,208
Booze first!

240
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,375
Of course, Booze.

241
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,625
Hey, easy.

242
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,875
Ankit, Order the food please.

243
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,416
- Wait I'll tell you.
- Dude right now?

244
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,666
Dude, if he'll order it right now then
it will be here after an hour!

245
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,708
So, License cancelled?

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,916
Dude, I did it twice now!

247
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,458
Guys, food is here!

248
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:03,791
Cheers!

249
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,041
Did you notice my nails?

250
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,250
Nice.

251
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,166
Thanks!

252
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,708
I'll get my drink!

253
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,625
Sure!

254
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,541
What's up Golu?

255
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,083
Is something Wrong?

256
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,791
What?

257
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,583
You seem down today!

258
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,333
Nope!

259
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,750
Come on, Tell me now.

260
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,291
Nope, why do you feel like that?

261
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,375
The way you are drinking today.

262
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,083
Something is definitely wrong!

263
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,833
Tell me.

264
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,916
You are the only one
who truly gets me, golu!

265
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,083
Hey, Don't touch my belly.

266
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,416
- Just let me touch it once!
- Nope, Not the belly!

267
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,333
Happy birthday to you,

268
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,250
Happy birthday to you,

269
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,625
Happy birthday dear Yashvant

270
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
Happy birthday to you

271
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,458
Woohoo!

272
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,916
Oho! One more! Haha

Come on!

276
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,583
Where?

277
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's go!

278
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,041
Okay, let's go!

279
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,875
Hmm, Yeah

280
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:56,833
Hey, hey!

281
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,166
Hmm. hmm.

282
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,208
Not me, not me. Hey, hey. No, no, no.

283
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:08,791
Come on!

284
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,750
Hey, hey.

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,291
Umm

286
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,291
No, no.

287
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,333
Hey, hey, hey

288
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,208
Stop, stop, stop

289
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,291
Wait, wait

290
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,916
Have it, have it, have it!

291
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,750
Yes, Mr. Bhavin,
I need 3 bottles, yes now!

292
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,041
I am all alone man!

293
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,333
At least I am safe!

294
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
Don't you dare to laugh!
It is all because of you!

295
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,750
I can not go out dude, Try and Understand!

296
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Bro, do something, it's my birthday today

297
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,958
Actually I was planning to
invite you for the party, but

298
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,500
Wait a minute

299
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,083
Hello? Hello?

300
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,125
Bro. By any means necessary,
arrange the bottle.

301
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,500
It's your responsibility.

302
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,833
Yes, I'll do it. Don't worry.

303
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,208
My bootlegger is out of reach
right now, talk to yours!

304
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,333
Can't even arrange a single bottle.
I'll do it myself!

305
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,291
Oh, Miss over-smart!

306
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,708
It's on our reputation now!

307
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,000
Come on, call someone!

308
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,375
Hello,
Bro listen, I need a bottle right now!

309
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,416
Hey, Sujal. Listen, no! I need a favour.

310
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,291
Yes, Mr. Sujal. How are you?

311
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,250
I am all good!

312
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,708
Yes, I have it in stock!

313
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,166
When? Now?

314
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,541
Where?

315
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,833
I am enroute for a delivery.

316
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,833
I'll be there after an hour
or two, is that okay?

317
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,916
Sure!

318
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,375
Yes

319
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,958
Yes, I'll be there within half an hour.

320
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,416
But listen!

321
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,875
It is very strict outside!
Can you pay double?

322
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,541
Done?

323
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,416
Done, Send me the location,
I am on my way!

324
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,625
Where?

325
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,875
It's nearby only.

326
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,166
- But where?
- Stop if you see any bikes!

327
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,416
Sure, will catch up soon!
Enjoy your party.

328
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,166
The bottles will be here
within half an hour!

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,833
Wohoo!

330
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,875
I know this guy, I know that guy.

331
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,166
I have this much contact,
I have that much contact.

332
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,833
You can't even arrange
a single bottle! What a shame!

333
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,416
Learn it from your own sister!

334
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,333
Bro, Arrange the bottle right
now or this will be it for us

335
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,791
Hello Mr. Oversmart! Cut the crap,

336
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,875
the bottle will be here
within half an hour.

337
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,791
This will be it for us!

338
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,875
There, stop over there.

339
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,666
Bro let's deliver to that old pimp first?

340
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,000
He is paying us double

341
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,625
Get another bottle
and give it to that old dude.

342
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,000
Old pimp will be furious!

343
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,125
Let him. What can he do?

344
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,708
Clear?

345
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,125
Yes. No-one is there. Go for it.

346
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,125
Hmm.
Come on. Fast.

347
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,083
Move, move.

348
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,000
Done?

349
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,458
Try the kick. Kick it.

350
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,166
Go, go, go. Let's go, quick.

351
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,708
Alright I am leaving now.

352
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,708
Shall I scratch that for you?

353
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,833
Excuse me!

354
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,125
At Vinita's

355
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,625
Which Flat number?

356
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know that.

357
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,458
Call them and let me talk to them!

358
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Hello, Vinita?

359
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,583
Yes, Who's this?

360
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,541
Yeah, I had a word with Mr. Sujal.

361
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,500
I got your gift.

362
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,208
Okay, Come upstairs!

363
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,375
Yes, Talk to this sweet bodyguard!

364
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,666
Here!

365
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,291
Hello?

366
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,375
Yes, Mr. Naamdev. Send him upstairs!

367
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,083
Who's this?

368
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,375
It's Vinita. Now send him upstairs.

369
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,458
Okay madam!

370
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,333
Enter your details!

371
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,000
You can scratch peacefully now!

372
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,041
Huh

373
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,250
Seriously!

374
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,125
Why did she call him upstairs!

375
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,166
Is he even a bootlegger?

376
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,958
Finally!

377
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,666
Ankit, get some ice please!

378
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,416
Yes, I was going down only. I'll get them!

379
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,250
Bro, Give him cash!

380
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,958
Thanks, Great party man!

381
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,583
You have something on your shoulder!

382
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,250
It didn't bite you did it?

383
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,708
Nope

384
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,416
Enjoy Your party!

385
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,416
Guys if you don't mind can
I stay here for a while?

386
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,208
There was a checkpost nearby.

387
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,625
Nobody followed me,
I took care of that but just in case!

388
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,958
If you guys are okay with it!

389
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,666
I'll settle somewhere here!

390
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,583
No-no, I mean the checkpost
would have been cleared by now!

391
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:17,666
No-no. You can stay.

392
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,333
Why do we have any problem? Have a seat.

393
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,458
Feel free to join us, have a seat!

394
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:25,791
Thanks

395
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,250
Hii, Ruchika. Nice to meet you.

396
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,083
Vishal

397
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:38,666
You want to sit?

398
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,625
No-no, He will find his place. You sit no!

399
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,375
Whose birthday is it?

400
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,458
His

401
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,958
Happy birthday bro

402
00:25:59,291 --> 00:25:59,791
Thank you

403
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,250
Hey, pass me the bottle!

404
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,583
Whiskey?

405
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,541
No, thanks

406
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,541
What would you sit ideally? Have it!

407
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,125
Sure

408
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:21,708
What's her name?

409
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:22,583
Trisha

410
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,708
Trisha

411
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,166
On the rocks!

412
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,416
Cheers!

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,875
Cheers!

414
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,666
Why is he sitting here?

415
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,000
Keep your eyes open for a while!
You'll get to know everything.

416
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,500
So

417
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,500
Umm, Nothing.

418
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,083
So, what do you do for a living?

419
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:04,625
Cheers!

420
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,791
Hmm!

421
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,125
See my nails,

422
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,333
I got them done at a spa. So shiny no!

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,416
Nice!

424
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,875
Dude, Can I get fit like you in a month!

425
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,416
Yes, Of course!

426
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:26,916
Cheers!

427
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,458
Cheers!

428
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:31,416
Man, this is the smoothest
scotch I ever had!

429
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,458
Thank you!

430
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,875
He is not the Master distiller!

431
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:45,125
Bro, Checkpost would definitely be
disbursed by now, just in case if you

432
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,083
Sorry, I'll leave.

433
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,125
Hmm

434
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,875
At least complete your drink.

435
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,041
No-no, I'll leave.

436
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:51,875
I insist.

437
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:52,958
I was leaving only!

438
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,750
Let's have a drink together!

439
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,208
You want my number?

440
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,750
I'll get you the desired
brand of whiskey. Anytime!

441
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,875
It's okay. I drink occasionally.

442
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,125
I doubt that.

443
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:08,916
Yeah, So where was I?

444
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Yes I deliver the goods on
the vehicles which I steal

445
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,500
so that I can leave them wherever I want!

446
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,416
You steal as well!

447
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,166
Motto is to deliver, not to steal!

448
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,375
Cheers

449
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,166
Just a minute!

450
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,666
There was a deadend so I got caught,

451
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,208
then I got beaten by the crowd
till they got fed up.

452
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,291
So why did you continue
even after this much trouble?

453
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,125
Why didn't you think of something else?

454
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,541
What else can I do, a regular 10 to 6 job?

455
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,916
I want easy money,
Two hours of work a day.

456
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,875
I only keep premium stuff, I earn good.

457
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:33,791
I am gym-freak,
you just got the demo of that!

458
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,500
I love to dance so I dance the whole day!

459
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,250
Meet Mr. Khambhata and Mrs. Khambhata.

460
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,541
They go out for a spin.

461
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,958
They are moving on, moving on, moving on,
moving on, moving on, moving on,

462
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,583
and suddenly they change their posture

463
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,541
What are you doing!

464
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,583
Let's do it together!

465
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,875
Hey, come on. It'll be fun.

466
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,791
No, no, no.

467
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,708
You are a party saviour!

468
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,541
You know, you are doing a noble job.

469
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,041
Wait Trisha. Wait, wait, wait.

470
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:12,000
Dude, how much liquor did you have?
Chill!

471
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,833
I have good capacity okay!

472
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,083
Okay! Let's check it out!

473
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I won!

474
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,958
You don't have a good capacity
and you are a bootlegger!

475
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,500
If horse be friends with
the grass it'll be starving.

476
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,958
But everyone should get
a chance, come on baby!

477
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,041
Now, win this!

478
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:36,916
Watch this!

479
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,583
Okay!

480
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,708
Whoa!

481
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,666
I also want this. I also want to do this.

482
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,875
No. No, no, no.

483
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,833
What is going on here!

484
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,875
Behave Vinita.

485
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,583
- What are you doing! Get up now!
- Leave me man!

486
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,416
Watch out, be careful.

487
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,125
Flirting with him so directly!

488
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,000
He is a bootlegger, remember!

489
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,500
But he is hot!

490
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,541
Have some standards!

491
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,583
Be careful there.

492
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,791
Hello

493
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,750
Ask this bastard to leave man!

494
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:13,416
What happened!

495
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,750
He is a showoff and he is
showing off his swag...

496
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:15,750
...since he has been here!

497
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,375
Do whatever you have to
but make him leave this place,

498
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,291
It's been two hours now!

499
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,500
Woohooo

500
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,083

00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,083
Dude, you are guys here to
do this on my birthday!

518
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,958
Oh, sorry bro, I know it's your birthday.

519
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,875
I'll play an epic song, the whole
surrounding would be set!

520
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:51,541
Whose phone is connected?

521
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:52,208
Mine, mine.

00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,166

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,291
Wohoo!

575
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,125
So, how old are you!

576
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:53,791
Tell me please!

577
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,791
Tell me no!

578
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,041
Twenty-one!

579
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,250
You are younger than me!

580
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,708
Yes, aunty!

581
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,750
Hey!

582
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,041
I kept this beard so that people
would take me seriously.

583
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,708
Or else I would get lollipops instead
of money against the liquor!

584
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,875
I need to go to the washroom.

585
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,041
Do you need any help?

586
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,083
Let me help you, let's go!

587
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:34,708
Dude, I didn't want to be here!

588
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,041
I was frustrated so I thought
let's have a couple of drinks!

589
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,083
Frustrated? Why is that?

590
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,041
Oh god, I am so high.

591
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:43,958
Trisha

592
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,083
I am fine, fine, fine.

593
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,500
Are you okay?

594
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:54,541
Yeah I am fine!

595
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:55,541
Don't lock the door!

596
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,750
Yeah!

597
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,500
Hey, help me!

598
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,125
Yeah sure!
You should sleep now!

599
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,958
Huh, What is sleep!

600
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,666
Did you sleep or what!

601
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,583
Shh!

602
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,791
Whoa!

603
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,083
I want to see your abs!

604
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,125
What!

605
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,125
Come on, show it to me!

606
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,333
Sure! That's why I got them!

607
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,291
Hey

608
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:34,458
Morning!

609
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,833
Morning

610
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:48,666
Okay!

611
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:23,708
Umm!

612
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,583
Done?

613
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,250
Just a moment!

614
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,333
Okay.

615
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:08,250
Done.

616
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:13,333
Listen, I want to...
you get that done first!

617
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,875
Umm

618
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,458
Don't ask for my contact number.

619
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:23,166
I

620
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,333
We had a moment and I really enjoyed it.

621
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,541
No, seriously.

622
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:33,166
I enjoyed it but it won't happen again!

623
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,875
Our paths will not cross again!

624
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:40,166
So if you ever get excited
for this then I suggest you don't!

625
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,458
Don't track me please!

626
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,125
Not on calls, office, home, social media.

627
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:52,250
Not at a single place!
Please don't! Got it?

628
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,458
Actually! I was about to say this only!

629
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,875
I have a different lifestyle
so we won't fit in!

630
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,125
Thank God, you relieved me!

631
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,166
Shall we leave?

632
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:12,750
Sure!

633
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,541
Just a minute!
Does anybody know about us?

634
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,500
I went to collect my bag,
Everyone is asleep!

635
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:22,916
Let's get out of here then!

636
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,875
Yeah!

637
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:50,666
This is weird!

638
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,208
I forgot your name!

639
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,541
Don't you dare laugh!

640
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,500
I was drunk, that's why I don't remember!

641
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,833
I didn't say anything!

642
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,333
I can see you laughing!

643
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,333
You think that I do this on
a regular basis!

644
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,625
It's not that!

645
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:26,666
Forget it.

646
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:29,833
Hello!

647
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,875
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

648
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:33,250
Will you stop laughing?

649
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,208
I'm trying.

650
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:35,875
Oho, sorry, sorry, sorry.

651
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:36,875
Stop.

652
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,250
Okay, bye, see you!

653
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:41,208
Sure?

654
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:45,291
I mean I'll never see you again. Bye.

655
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,333
Bye.

656
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:58,458
Is Sneha inside?

657
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:01,958
Yeah, but there is a patient as well!
Hello, ma'am!

658
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,916
Do I need to visit next week?

659
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,625
Only if you have to! Else you'll be
fine with these medications!

660
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,708
Okay, thank you!

661
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,500
Couldn't you wait for a while!

662
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,500
Patient gets awkward!

663
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,750
You think I will wait!

664
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,833
Of course not. Tell me.

665
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,458
Periods!

666
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,166
When was the last date?

667
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:33,875
Last month 25th.
So, It's been more than 20 days!

668
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:38,250
So, were you sexually active?

669
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,166
Trisha.

670
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,291
Let's check it!

671
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:24,291
No, no, no.

672
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,916
Please give me a moment.

673
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,875
Trisha

674
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,541
Dad should not know this!

675
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:01,250
Happy birthday to you,

676
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,791
Happy birthday to you,

677
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:10,833
Happy birthday dear Aarohi

678
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,708
Happy Birthday to you

679
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,333
Happy Birthday

680
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,625
Thank you!

681
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,041
It's not your fault.

682
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:07,666
Sir

683
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:15,291
Good morning dear.

684
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,208
Why are you back early?

685
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:24,250
Dad, I wanted to discuss something!

686
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,125
Have a seat dear.

687
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:27,958
Go on!

688
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,666
Anything serious, my dear?

689
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,208
Dad, I

690
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,458
Go on!

691
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:49,250
Dad, I wanted to take a tough call!

692
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,333
Just a minute,

693
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,208
are you planning to take admission
in any new university?

694
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,375
No!

695
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,125
So you are not going out of India, right?

696
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,000
No.

697
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,916
Then it's all good.
You can take any call you want.

698
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,333
I am fine with it!

699
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,250
Dad

700
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:12,750
What happened?

701
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,833
I'm expecting a baby.

702
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,833
What?

703
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:33,500
You're joking, right?

704
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,708
You are pregnant!

705
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,375
How? I mean with whom?

706
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:44,458
Where? When?

707
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,791
I am sure Ankit will be the one.

708
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,208
I haven't liked that guy since day one!

709
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,250
No, not Ankit

710
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,708
If not Ankit then who?

711
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,708
See, It could be a mistake as well.

712
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:09,833
All these kits are not
hundred percent accurate!

713
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,458
Let's get the lab reports.

714
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:15,125
We will talk to Sneha!

715
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,291
Sneha, herself confirmed it.

716
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,250
You already met Sneha!

717
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:28,750
Then why didn't she tell me any of this!

718
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,541
How long has this been?

719
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:39,291
Around forty-five days

720
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:44,250
But you are in town for one and half
months then with whom did you?

721
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,333
I can't tell you that!

722
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,833
What do you mean by that?

723
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,291
You won't like it!

724
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,916
What is there to like?

725
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,583
Because he is not okay!

726
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,333
Then why did you...

727
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:22,708
What are you going to do now?

728
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,333
I want this child!

729
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,458
So you want to get married!

730
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,166
Ohh that's fine for me.

731
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,125
You can marry whoever you want to!
Feel free.

732
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't have any problem with that!

733
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,958
I can't get married to that guy!

734
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:43,416
What rubbish! What do you mean by that?

735
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,916
Because, because...

736
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,875
Is he already married?

737
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:46,916
No!

738
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,541
Do you even know who it is?

739
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,458
DAD!

740
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,416
Abortion is the option!

741
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:13,625
No.

742
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:15,916
Are you out of your mind!

743
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:19,333
We don't have any other option.
Abortion is the option!

744
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:20,500
No!

745
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:39,166
One thing I am sure about is that
I won't abort this baby.

746
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,500
I will bring this baby.

747
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,625
This is my child.

748
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,166
It's my flesh and blood dad!

749
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,291
What are you talking about!
Do you even realise that...

750
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,208
Sorry

751
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,041
Listen to me dear

752
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,000
Sorry!

753
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:43,583
For Bhuvan!

754
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,250
Sir

755
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:50,583
Sir!

756
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:51,500
Hmm?

757
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:52,958
For Bhuvan

758
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:54,750
Hmm.

759
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,000
Here.
Bhuvan

760
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:13,666
Hmm?

761
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,708
Sign over here!

762
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,208
Sir?

763
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:32,833
Hmm?

764
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:36,208
Sir, Do you have a minute?

765
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,541
Go ahead!

766
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:43,666
Sir, I lost two bottles
which cost me around 20.

767
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:45,291
Lawyer will have 35.

768
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,625
So, overall it cost me fifty-five!

769
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,208
So?

770
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:53,000
I'll pay a fixed amount to
you every month!

771
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,583
Sorry sir!

772
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,666
What I was saying is that I'll have
to pay somebody then why not you!

773
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,375
Sorry sir!

774
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,041
Forget it sir. Forget it. Cancel, Cancel.

775
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,375
Vishal, I am leaving!

776
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,291
Just a minute, sir!

777
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,291
It's Thirty-five.

778
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,625
Be careful next time.

779
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,666
Yes.

780
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:18,541
Let's go, idiot. Where are your slippers?

781
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:19,958
I lost them in the chase!

782
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,708
More 100 bucks!

783
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,458
Idiot, couldn't you run faster!

784
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,208
- Stop hitting me now!
- Shut up, Let's go.

785
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,291
Did he agree?

786
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,666
I gave him the offer,
but he didn't answer!

787
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,958
Leave him then!

788
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:48,916
Trisha!

789
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:46,583
I upset you, didn't I?

790
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,416
I am Upset!

791
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,583
Sorry!

792
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,750
Should I tell him?

793
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,000
To that guy?

794
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,083
Means?

795
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,041
Does he not know?

796
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,000
Do you want to accept him?

797
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,291
No!

798
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:59,791
It would not be fair if
I don't tell him about this.

799
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:05,958
The sort of feeling I have for this child,

800
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,291
he too can have that!

801
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:14,541
See,

802
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:22,041
if you tell him and if he gets upset

803
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:28,500
or he gets scared then I know
what your reactions would be!

804
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,458
But

805
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,791
what if he agrees to accept this baby?

806
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,958
What would be your reactions then?
What would you do?

807
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,166
That's why I am here.

808
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,375
What should I do?

809
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:43,166
Should I tell him?

810
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,875
Are you guys in touch?

811
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:47,916
Nope!

812
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,541
Did you two have a fight?

813
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,416
No!

814
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:56,791
Then what can I suggest! I don't know!

815
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:01,583
I also don't know dad!

816
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,583
Tell him.

817
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,083
Tell him.

818
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:21,375
We will take the decision on
how he would react!

819
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:22,625
Go tell him!

820
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,625
Sure?

821
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,583
Sure, Sure!

822
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,375
Ok

823
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,541
I'll start looking for him tomorrow.

824
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,125
Find him?

825
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,791
You are not in contact with him?

826
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:46,500
Nope!

827
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,750
How many times have you guys met?

828
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:51,708
Once!

829
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,583
You met him only once and you

830
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,541
Good night. Dad!

831
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,791
This is a R3 zone.

832
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,125
So there won't be any sort of construction
on this side so your view will be

833
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:05,041
Excuse me!

834
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:07,041
Um, sorry!

835
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,416
This is the parking and it is hydraulic

836
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,000
so...
Excuse me

837
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,833
Trisha I am with a client,
I'll call you back.

838
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,875
Vinita, send me the number
of that bootlegger!

839
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:24,833
What!

840
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:26,791
Dude, at Yashvant's Birthday
there was a bootlegger right.

841
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,708
Give me his number.

842
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,458
Trisha! I will call you soon.

843
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,375
Hey!

844
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:32,708
Come on!

845
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,541
So I was saying, parking is

846
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,916
Vinita, Listen Come on!

847
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:53,666
So you don't have to
Sorry, I have to take this.

848
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:55,625
I am pregnant!

849
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,083
What!

850
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,250
Hello!

851
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,083
Hii, Sujal.

852
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,458
Yes Vinita.

853
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,583
What happened to your voice? Are you okay?

854
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:03,875
I am in hospital.

855
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,041
Why? What happened?

856
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:06,708
Vinita, come to the point!

857
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:07,833
- Yeah
- Who is this?

858
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,416
Sujal, I need that bootlegger's number.

859
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:16,458
Have a look at my condition, I
am hospitalised. Stop drinking!

860
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,083
Please give me his number, Sujal.

861
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,458
Quit drinking Vinita.

862
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,750
This drinking habit of mine
has cost me a kidney.

863
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,458
Quit it.

864
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,375
Dude, We need his number
from you, not advice.

865
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,000
Who is this!

866
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,291
Trisha, My friend.
She is also on the call.

867
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:33,750
Hii Trisha

868
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,791
Hii. Give me his number.

869
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,666
I don't drink anymore!

870
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,166
Good for you, Now send me his number.

871
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:43,375
I've deleted all the bootlegger's numbers!

872
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:44,250
What!

873
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:45,125
Shit

874
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:50,875
Yes. Liquor, cigarettes,
I've quit them all.

875
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,875
TO be very honest. You should stop it too.

876
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:56,333
Vinita, now if he has
started lecturing again.

877
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:57,833
I personally, will take his
second kidney out of his body.

878
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:58,541
What!

879
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,583
Trisha, Please.

880
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,750
Sujal, is there any other way?

881
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,625
How can we contact him?
Do you have his address?

882
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,958
No!

883
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,583
He used to deliver only.

884
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,333
But now I have deleted all the numbers!

885
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,625
What was his name?

886
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,625
I don't know his name!

887
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:20,083
I saved their number as bootlegger 1,

888
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:24,750
bootlegger 2, bootlegger 3.

889
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,000
Quit alcohol.

890
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,416
In which hospital you are in?
Give me your address. Now.

891
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:32,958
Oh god!

892
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,291
Trisha, now what?

893
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,583
Trisha, can you hear me?

894
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,916
Yeah, Yeah. I am here only.

895
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:47,750
When was Yashvant's birthday?

896
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,208
12th July.

897
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,333
- This is 11th
- 12th would be right after that!

898
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,583
Somewhere around 1 am

899
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:56,833
What is this?

900
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,791
Excuse me, can you read this out
for me, Please?

901
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,000
I couldn't get this madam!

902
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,375
So, if anyone just makes any
sort of design in the register

903
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:05,625
and they can go in the building, right?

904
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:06,583
Sorry madam.

905
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:09,583
What sorry? This was the last hope man!

906
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,708
Trisha, You can find him
on FB or Instagram!

907
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:14,208
Bro! I don't even remember his name!

908
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:15,916
What do we do now?

909
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,458
Shit man!

910
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,791
There is just one way left now.

911
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,333
Just keep this with you.

912
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,083
Trisha?

913
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:00,166
Hey umm... listen do you have any...

914
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:05,708
Any boot-bootlegger's number?
Hello

915
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:06,791
Hmm. Go on.

916
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,625
Yeah. How are you?

01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:09,833

920
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,916
What do you call it? Stuff?

921
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,875
What stuff?

922
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:24,333
Yeah, Yeah. I mean, I mean umm,

We drink it no?

925
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:28,666
Bottle?

926
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:33,166
Bottle! Yes bottle, Liquor umm whiskey.

927
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,833
Do you have Whiskey?

928
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,875
Yes, I have it! Do you want it?

929
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,875
Yes, I want it.

930
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,625
Tell me the address, I'll deliver it.

931
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,250
Address!

932
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,166
Give me your address madam!

933
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,958
Alright, I am,
I am sending you the address!

934
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:56,500
Hello?

935
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,041
I have reached over here but
there is a watchman outside.

936
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,291
Yeah, I am, I will be there in a second!

937
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,125
Do you have any bootlegger's number?

938
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,708
Do you have any bootleggers number?

939
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:29,916
Do you have the number of someone
who keeps the premium stuff?

940
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,916
What is a bootlegger?

941
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,375
Let's party together!

942
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,208
Bro, Come over here. The Party is on!

943
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,166
Call him. He'll deliver at your place.

944
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:36,833
Is he hot?

945
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:40,750
Yes. Mohit gave me your number.
Do you have anything?

946
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:42,083
Ask him to call me first!

947
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:45,000
But Okay!

948
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,041
Hey Mohit, You need to call him first!

949
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes, I am sending you a number. Ask them.

950
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:52,250
Talk to him, talk to
her-what's the deal here?

951
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,500
Am I in a government office or what?

952
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:55,208
Yes, Mr. Bhura. Mr. Bhaga
gave me your number.

953
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:55,833
Do you have anything?

954
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:56,958
No, nothing right now.

955
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,625
Yes, Did you get a call from Mohit?

956
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,833
Alright. Sending you the address.

957
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:03,333
What do you want? I'll get it for you!

958
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,625
Yeah, Sending.

959
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,791
Yeah, Order two for me as well.

960
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,250
I'll collect it later.

961
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,250
Bro, My dad has the permit no!

962
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,208
Tell me what do you want?

963
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,833
Do you have any bootlegger's number?

964
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:19,166
Alcohol is so old-fashioned Trisha!
It's time to go green.

965
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,125
I will not deliver that far!

966
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,958
Do you want to do the business or not?

967
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,000
Hang up the phone.

968
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,750
Are you a bootlegger?

969
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,666
I did not expect that question from you!

970
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,541
Nowadays women can do anything.

971
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,416
Feminist!

972
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,250
Send Hii on Whatsapp.

973
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,875
Then I'll send you the coordinates,
come over there!

974
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,750
Dude, I'll pay extra but
deliver at this address.

975
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,791
Yes brother. I am sending you
an address. Send a bottle over there.

976
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:45,833
I'm not some bootlegger!

977
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,583
You've got the wrong number,
I'm a teacher.

978
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:49,458
Your constant bothering is
incredibly frustrating.

979
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,041
Hang up now before I involve the police!

980
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,458
Oh shit. Sorry, sorry!

981
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:54,041
My man will deliver it.
You can pay via Gpay!

982
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:56,375
I will pay on Gpay, send your man!

983
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,125
Hello?

984
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:06,666
Yes ma'am. I am about to reach.

985
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,041
I am coming down in a minute.

986
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,000
Okay.

987
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,916
Mummy

988
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Pay it on Gpay!

989
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,541
Hey, Did the police follow you or what?

990
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:26,875
I am not in the town.

991
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,291
I can come tomorrow if that's okay!

992
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,041
Call me once you are back!

993
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,000
Okay

994
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,083
How do I figure out his name?

995
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,291
Champion

996
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:47,000
What?

997
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,375
Champion, Champion.

998
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,208
Champion of what?

999
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,583
Champion. That's when we pop
the bottle and it sprays everywhere!

1000
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:55,583
Champagne?

1001
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:56,625
Yeah, yeah. That one.

1002
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,916
No, that's fine.

1003
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:03,333
Find him.
Find him.

1004
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,291
Brother, do you have any
young bootlegger's number?

1005
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:08,875
Am I not young enough?

1006
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,916
Howzat?

1007
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,250
I've beer only, do you want it?

1008
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,666
Bro, you must expand your business.

1009
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,833
Scotch is more profitable. Anyways!

1010
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,583
And Ronaldo passes to Rooney,
Rooney, Rooney gets to

1011
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:47,583
Ronaldo and Ronaldo running
to the nets and YEAH!

1012
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,250
Find him!

1013
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,458
Send me the number of bootleggers!

1014
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,000
What? Just one number! Come on!

1015
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,000
What the hell!

1016
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,333
Ma'am this is not the right time.

1017
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,666
Police is very strict nowadays.

1018
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:04,750
Don't worry about the police.

1019
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,750
If you get caught, call me,
I'll take care of it.

1020
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:07,916
Scaredy-cat

1021
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:08,791
Do you have anything?

1022
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:09,708
Yes.

1023
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,833
Cut the crap, Do you have abs?

1024
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:18,375
What's this?

1025
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,041
You're delivering liquor
with your entire family?

1026
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,000
Have you no shame?

1027
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,125
The woman is a stand-in
wife so are the kids!

1028
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:27,083
This is child labour,
run before I call the cops!

1029
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:34,625
Where are you!

1030
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,541
The minimum quantity would be two!
So what do you want to do!

1031
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,750
Fine, I'll have two!

1032
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,291
Sorry. Sorry

1033
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:57,291
Whenever I am going to see you,
I am going to kick you. hiya!

1034
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,041
Yes brother, Do you have anything?

1035
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:01,375
Yes, I have everything in stock,
what do you want madam?

1036
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,416
Should we deal on video call?

1037
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,375
Yeah, yeah. Sure!

1038
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:16,291
What happened? You don't need anything?

1039
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,583
Nope!

1040
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:25,000
He died due to poisonous alcohol!

1041
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,166
Hey, hey. Please don't cry!

1042
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:37,291
Poisonous alcohol!
Ohh!

1043
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:40,791
Hey you were the one on
video call that day!

1044
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:43,041
Yes, I've got two different
contact numbers!

1045
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:45,958
Eww. Stay away.
You stink and you are drunk.

1046
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,708
Aww. Did you feel bad!

1047
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:59,708
Where are you... yeah!

1048
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:10,666
Bootlegger with abs in ahmedabad

1049
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:20,708
Woohoo! Strike!

1050
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,916
Oh no! This also tastes like liquor!

1051
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,875
Yeah, Just a minute. Just a minute.

1052
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:39,791
Yes, Mr. Kamlesh.

1053
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,833
Ankit gave me your number!

1054
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,916
Dad, Why didn't you knock
before coming in?

1055
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,583
What's that?

1056
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,500
Dad

1057
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:46,833
What are you up to?

1058
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:48,625
I won't have a single drop
from all of this!

1059
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,083
This is a house or

1060
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,291
I am not frustrated!

1061
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,208
What's all these!

1062
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,708
I am mentally fit and fine!

1063
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:54,458
This many!

1064
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:55,708
I'm doing everything after thinking only!

1065
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:56,333
Are you out of your mind?

1066
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,208
Don't ask me anything

1067
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,250
- I can't even ask why?
- No!

1068
01:17:58,333 --> 01:17:59,291
- What's all this?
- Nothing

1069
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,000
- But
- Just

1070
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:00,666
- Are you okay?
- Zip

1071
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,916
- Let me. See, talk to
- Zip... shhh. Zip

1072
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,833
- This
- Zup

1073
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:04,791
I am Easy

1074
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:05,666
- Listen at least
- Stay calm and sit.

1075
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,708
You don't have to worry!

1076
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:07,666
See, Trisha.

1077
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,916
- You can talk to me, that's okay!
- Hello. Yeah. yeah.

1078
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,875
- Listen
- Shh!

1079
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:11,208
- Listen dear
- Yeah, yeah. I am coming downstairs!

1080
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,541
- Trisha!
- Yes yes.

1081
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,375
This is not done!

1082
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,750
Sit here. I'll be back in a sec.

1083
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,125
- Trisha dear, Trisha
- Hello

1084
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:21,875
Umm

1085
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,166
Finally

1086
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:56,625
Oww

1087
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:15,083
Okay, okay, okay.

1088
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,125
Why?

1089
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,000
Trisha, Your hand!

1090
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,416
Where did you find my number from?

1091
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:11,208
It was a roller-coaster.

1092
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:22,500
Was it me or my performance?

1093
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:23,750
What?

1094
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:26,500
Where are we headed?

1095
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,375
Just!

1096
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,291
There is a hotel nearby.

1097
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:40,833
If we want to go there!

1098
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:43,041
Oh god. What is happening!

1099
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:49,375
What's your name?

1100
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,958
Don't laugh, tell me your name!

1101
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,000
Vishal

1102
01:20:58,875 --> 01:20:59,833
Vishal

1103
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:01,833
Vishal

1104
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,791
Vishal

1105
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,375
We are here to talk only!

1106
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:22,625
After a while!

1107
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:23,541
Okay, madam!

1108
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:41,833
I wanted to discuss something!

1109
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:44,375
Yes!

1110
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:52,666
Last time when we met, whatever
happened between us!

1111
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:54,625
Do you remember that?

1112
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,208
Yes, Of course.
I remember everything in detail.

1113
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,791
I just remembered again!

1114
01:21:58,833 --> 01:21:59,541
Oh, Stop it!

1115
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:00,916
Can't control. Come on, let's go!

1116
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,250
You also enjoyed it, no?

1117
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,333
I want to discuss a very serious matter...

1118
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:07,291
Stop laughing!

1119
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,541
Okay

1120
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:12,166
Relax

1121
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,875
I am relaxed only!

1122
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:42,833
I am pregnant!

1123
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,625
Congratulations!

1124
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,083
How?

1125
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:08,166
What do you mean?

1126
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,958
So, on that day?

1127
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,333
I am the one?

1128
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,375
Yes!

1129
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:29,458
Confirm?

1130
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,166
Why else would I be sitting here with you?

1131
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,958
No, I mean are you sure it's me?

1132
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,583
I mean maybe after that you might had

1133
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:39,375
I'll kill you!

1134
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:41,916
No, I am sure it's me! Of course.

1135
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,458
I want this baby!

1136
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,958
You are very brave!

1137
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:56,583
I know!

1138
01:23:57,916 --> 01:24:00,125
I took this call after giving
a lot of thoughts.

1139
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:18,458
I am too young... only 21.

1140
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,958
If someone starts calling me dad,
It would completely blow my mind!

1141
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,916
What!

1142
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,875
Yes! I am not even settled
and with that if I had to marry

1143
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:25,375
Hey

1144
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:26,666
Then there will be more
responsibilities on me, to meet them...

1145
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,625
...I'll have to sell 5 more bottles which
means there will be more risk

1146
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:29,333
More risk means

1147
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:31,250
- I'll be beaten by the police!
- Vishal, Vishal!

1148
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:35,166
Listen dude! I don't want to marry you!

1149
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:35,750
What!

1150
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,083
We are not each other's type!

1151
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,458
Neither I have any expectation from you

1152
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:42,208
nor do you have any responsibilities.

1153
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,291
So chill.

1154
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,041
I am capable enough.

1155
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,583
I'll manage all of this by myself!

1156
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:59,250
The reason to share this with you
is because this is your child as well.

1157
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,666
You might have some
feelings toward him/her!

1158
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:06,750
I think you should know this. That's it!

1159
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:28,750
I need a cigarette.

1160
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,375
It was a bit too much to take!

1161
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:35,541
Do you need one?

1162
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,541
Ohh Sorry!

1163
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,541
I don't know what I am just rambling!

1164
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,041
Fraidy-cat

1165
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,375
Use protection bro!

1166
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,708
As expected!

1167
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,583
Coffee.

1168
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,541
I am in!

1169
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,875
But I won't stop delivering liquor!

1170
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:40,625
And you'll have to explain
everything to me because

1171
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,083
I don't understand any bit of this.

1172
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:44,000
I'll follow whatever you'll say!

1173
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,208
It's tasteless!

1174
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:53,916
You

1175
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:09,500
Tomorrow I'll have to go to the hospital!

1176
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,416
I'll be there!

1177
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Okay!

1178
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,208
You see that blinking over there!

1179
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:35,583
That's the baby's heartbeat!

1180
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:42,875
Vishal

1181
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:47,666
What would be the expected date?

1182
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,000
May I?

1183
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:49,916
Sure!

1184
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,000
Vishal, relax!

1185
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,833
Yes!

1186
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,375
Stay aside. Let her have a look!

1187
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,375
Sorry.

1188
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:06,166
I couldn't find the expected date!

1189
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,500
What are you?

1190
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:09,541
Sneha!

1191
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,333
Mid-april.

1192
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:17,125
Mid-April

1193
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:19,583
It's okay.

1194
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,041
Let me help you!

1195
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:17,833
I'll manage!

1196
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,625
Okay!

1197
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,083
Do you need help?

1198
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:27,208
What!

1199
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,250
How much?

1200
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,416
- Hey
- What exactly are you?

1201
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:34,875
Vishal, Keep your wallet inside!

1202
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:35,958
- This is too much!
- I am so sorry sneha.

1203
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:37,208
I am paying, no? How much is it?

1204
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,500
- Vishal, Let's go!
- Who is this Trisha?

1205
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,250
I am so sorry Sneha!

1206
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:40,750
I should be the one
who pays for all of this!

1207
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:41,791
Keep that wallet inside!

1208
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,333
Let's go. Open the door.

1209
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,125
- Yes, yes. Stop pushing me!
- I am so sorry.

1210
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:46,791
What was that!

1211
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,791
Why? We need to pay the doctor no!

1212
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,000
She is my sister!

1213
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:51,666
Real sister?

1214
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,500
No. Cousin!

1215
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,375
So, That's why she refused the money!

1216
01:30:56,666 --> 01:30:58,458
You don't ask the doctor about the money.

1217
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,333
You have to pay at the reception desk!

1218
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,916
Too much drama!

1219
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,541
My doctor directly takes money out of my pocket!

1220
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,041
Bye, Bye!

1221
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:16,500
Trisha!

1222
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:27,000
What!

1223
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,375
Just a minute!

1224
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:38,333
Do we need to ask the doctor
or if you are aware that

1225
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,291
You know what I mean, right?

1226
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:45,458
No!

1227
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,916
Can we have s

1228
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:01,125
Sex!

1229
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:02,708
Oh Yes!

1230
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:09,500
You

1231
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,458
I'll get my bike!

1232
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,083
Oh, We are going in the car!

1233
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:15,166
Hey, Get lost!

1234
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:19,166
Get lost?
Are we doing it or not?

1235
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,083
Sex!

1236
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:23,208
Hey Yes or no?

1237
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:41,333
Everything is okay, no?

1238
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,083
Health is fine, right?

1239
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:45,041
Okay, Name?

1240
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,166
Did you get to know his name?

1241
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,416
And the work profile?

1242
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,000
You might have got some idea
from the appearances, no?

1243
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:56,708
Alright, I'll talk to you later!

1244
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,833
Sneha it was!

1245
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:02,958
Yes

1246
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,208
Who else could it be!

1247
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,708
I want to meet him!

1248
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:07,625
Dad!

1249
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,291
I want to meet him!

1250
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:10,500
And what would you do after meeting him?

1251
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:13,458
Nothing. I just want to see him.

1252
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:15,166
What after that?

1253
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,250
This is nice!

1254
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,750
You can take him with you for the checkup

1255
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:19,958
and here I am asking you
that I want to meet him

1256
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,416
and you don't want me to meet him!

1257
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,750
He came there willingly. It was his call!

1258
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:26,208
This is my call.
I want to meet him.

1259
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,458
You will be depressed after meeting him.

1260
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,333
How can you do something
like this with someone...

1261
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,666
whatever it is. I want to meet him.

1262
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,833
- I need to talk to him
- I want to meet him.

1263
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:44,708
- But I have to
- Call him here.

1264
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:46,250
- Dad, Let me ask him first!
- I told you, I want to meet him.

1265
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,541
Whatever happens I want to meet him.

1266
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:49,375
But Okay, fine. Don't shout.

1267
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,875
Don't ever want to listen to me.
Sneha can meet him.

1268
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,333
- Everyone can meet him but me
- Okay!

1269
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,458
I want to meet

1270
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:58,333
I will ask him. Only if he is comfortable!

1271
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:02,041
Okay!

1272
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:06,125
You are just impossible!

1273
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:28,958
Hii

1274
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:29,583
Hii

1275
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:31,166
What were you doing inside?

1276
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:34,375
What sort of question is that!

1277
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:36,416
Have you got your bike?

1278
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,375
Yeah, Here it is.

1279
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:42,541
Let it be here. Let's go in the car.

1280
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,750
Sure. It's not even mine!

1281
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,500
Dad will be in shock!

1282
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:51,458
What? Dad what? I didn't listen.

1283
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:54,750
Dad wants to meet you!

1284
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,250
Only if you are comfortable!

1285
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:02,000
Sure. Let's meet him. What is this about?

1286
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:05,000
Sit in the car. I will tell you.

1287
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:07,208
Yeah, but at least tell me
what is this about?

1288
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:09,291
Just a minute!

1289
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,541
Does he want fitness tips?

1290
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:13,708
Be quiet!

1291
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,375
- Does he too want to see my abs?
- Easy, I'll tell you.

1292
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:20,375
I've already read this.
This one is

1293
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:21,375
Dad

1294
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:22,333
Yes

1295
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,333
Vishal

1296
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:26,916
Hello uncle!

1297
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:29,750
Hello!

1298
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:30,625
Let me give you a hand getting up!

1299
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:32,458
Ohh, Ouch!

1300
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,375
Are you okay?
I hope your muscles are fine!

1301
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:40,875
Have a seat Vishal!

1302
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:41,791
Yes!

1303
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,500
What is this guy!

1304
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:44,541
Button up your shirt!

1305
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:50,250
Vishal

1306
01:35:51,916 --> 01:35:52,791
Vishal!

1307
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:54,000
Hmm

1308
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,416
Let it be. It is fine.

1309
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,541
Looks like sultan of stupidity only!

1310
01:35:57,625 --> 01:35:58,500
Sit!

1311
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:01,208
It was very claustrophobic!

1312
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:02,958
That's fine!

1313
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:14,833
So what do you do?

1314
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:15,583
I am a

1315
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:17,416
Vishal, Tea, Coffee?

1316
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:20,416
Yes

1317
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:25,875
Right. We have to offer tea-coffee!

1318
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:27,125
Hmm.

1319
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,333
Vishnu!

1320
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:29,458
Yes sir!

1321
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,583
What would you have? Tea coffee?

1322
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:38,208
Vishal! Tea Coffee!

1323
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,083
Tea

1324
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,250
But it should be the dose of dynamite!

1325
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,208
Are you clear?

1326
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:46,291
It should be the dose of dynamite!

1327
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,000
Yes sir!

1328
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:48,250
I'll have a normal tea!

1329
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,916
I don't want to blow anything up! Okay!

1330
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:06,375
What do you do?

1331
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:09,708
I am a bootlegger!

1332
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:14,375
What! Boot...

1333
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:27,541
So, You sell liquor, Right?

1334
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,208
All Ahmedabad, 24x7

1335
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:31,208
Hey, Easy!

1336
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,708
I only keep premium stuff, uncle!

1337
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:40,291
Only premium stuff! Did you hear that?

1338
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:42,083
Yes Dad!

1339
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:47,041
Oh, right. So that's
why your room was full,

1340
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:48,875
all of that was because of him!

1341
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,875
Absolutely, Just for him!

1342
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:57,375
What else do you do!

1343
01:37:58,041 --> 01:38:01,916
Not much! Gym,
Body-building, dance. That's it.

1344
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,500
Hmm.

1345
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:05,208
Gym, Body, Dance. Nice!

1346
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,750
Give Him the dose of dynamic.

1347
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:09,541
He wants to build muscles
like a Greek god!

1348
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:16,583
Which one is mine?

1349
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:17,625
This.

1350
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:23,583
Is tea okay?

1351
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,833
Or she has too much dynamite in her room!

1352
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:27,375
What?

1353
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:29,000
Vishal, Have your tea.

1354
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:33,458
Dad, You also. Have your tea.

1355
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:38,875
Oh yeah!
Cheers!

1356
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,250
What is there to cheer in tea!

1357
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:46,583
Cheers!

1358
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,166
Cheers!

1359
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:49,416
Cheers!

1360
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:54,166
From where do you operate
these operations?

1361
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,125
From your home?

1362
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,500
No, I have a different space for that.

1363
01:38:57,791 --> 01:38:59,125
I don't have anything at my house!

1364
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:02,416
You have a house!

1365
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:03,916
Yes. Obviously, uncle!

1366
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,875
So, Does everybody at your home knows
that you do this sort of business?

1367
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:11,625
There is no one to tell.

1368
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:16,416
I don't have mom-dad. They died.

1369
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:19,583
What!

1370
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,000
You remember when Kedarnath
was in floods, At that time.

1371
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,875
I am, I am so sorry Vishal.

1372
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,208
We never got a chance
to talk this through.

1373
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,083
So in that flood, they?

1374
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,041
Yes!

1375
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:36,666
Later on I went there to find them,

1376
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:38,375
but couldn't find them.

1377
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,791
They might have been swept away!

1378
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:44,750
Mom-dad and my younger sister!

1379
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,958
I Was very young, maybe
that's why I couldn't find them.

1380
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:52,291
It was God's will!

1381
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:58,000
So your relatives didn't support you?

1382
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:00,125
No, it's not that.

1383
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,208
Uncles and aunties were there.

1384
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:03,958
They could have taken care
of me very well.

1385
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:08,083
But I didn't want to
be a burden on anyone,

1386
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:09,458
so I live alone!

1387
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:14,000
One of my friends lives next to me.

1388
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,041
Actually both of our families
went there together.

1389
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,458
And his family was also in floods...

1390
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:28,041
So, sometimes he stays at my place,
sometimes I stay at his.

1391
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,500
It's all good now!

1392
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:32,083
I am, I am so sorry Vishal.

1393
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,541
No, It's okay!

1394
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:42,708
Should I leave?

1395
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:46,125
Yeah!

1396
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:50,083
I'll take your leave then.

1397
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:51,541
I'll drop you.

1398
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:53,125
Nope. I'll manage.

1399
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:54,041
You stay here and take some rest.

1400
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:55,291
You Should take a rest!

1401
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:57,333
I'll be back in a while!

1402
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,750
Okay, bye uncle!

1403
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:02,208
Bye

1404
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:04,791
Dad, I'll be back after dropping him!

1405
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:05,708
Sure.

1406
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:02,833
Should I clean this up?

1407
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:12,291
Trisha

1408
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,041
Hmm,

1409
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:17,625
Yes?

1410
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:24,708
I've given it a lot of thought then

1411
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:27,041
only I am discussing this with you.

1412
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:28,958
About what?

1413
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,083
He is a good guy.

1414
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:37,958
Hmm.

1415
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:41,208
I mean, he has been through a lot,

1416
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,375
and maybe that's why he
is what he is today.

1417
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:45,958
But he comes from a good family.

1418
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,083
Hmm.

1419
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:52,250
Think about it.

1420
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:54,416
Think about what?

1421
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,791
Marriage.

1422
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:57,208
Come on, dad!

1423
01:43:58,458 --> 01:43:59,875
But what's the problem?

1424
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:03,333
His lifestyle, dad.

1425
01:44:03,791 --> 01:44:05,291
I can not live like that.

1426
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:06,833
He is not even settled.

1427
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:09,708
And you really want me
to marry a bootlegger?

1428
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,125
And roam around with him on
the bikes which he steals!

1429
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:16,916
So he is a thief as well.

1430
01:44:17,791 --> 01:44:22,416
Yes, he uses the stolen bikes
to deliver the bottle.

1431
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,083
Oh god! What is actually happening!

1432
01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:30,125
What other hidden talent
does this guy have?

1433
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,666
Stealing, robbery,
Burglary, Chain-snatching,

1434
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:35,375
is he a murderer as well?

1435
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,125
What are you saying?

1436
01:44:37,291 --> 01:44:38,541
What should I do now?

1437
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,875
You're revealing things one by one,

1438
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:42,541
and I don't understand
where to start thinking!

1439
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:44,916
There is nothing to think about.

1440
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:47,750
He has his perspective
of life and so do I.

1441
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:49,833
We both are right! If he wants
to meet the baby,

1442
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:50,791
I am okay with it.

1443
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:54,750
But nothing more than that.

1444
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,416
But

1445
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:06,541
what would be your life after this baby!

1446
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:10,333
If someone will ask you who
is the father of this child,

1447
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:12,166
then what would be your answer?

1448
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,833
Do you have any problem if
I stay in this house like this?

1449
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:14,791
Stay quiet!

1450
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:17,000
Sorry

1451
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:20,625
Do you have any problem!

1452
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:25,666
Let's do one thing!

1453
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:28,875
What if he quits this stealing robbery

1454
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,416
and stops selling liquor illegally

1455
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:35,041
and I will take over some ready business

1456
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:36,791
and I will ask him to handle it!

1457
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:38,416
He does not want
any obligation from anyone,

1458
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:39,708
didn't you hear that!

1459
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:42,958
Dad, He is still 21!

1460
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:47,375
He is not mature.
All he wants is easy money!

1461
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:49,041
That is all on me.

1462
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,791
I'll talk to him, just give me his number.

1463
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:52,166
What will you do after that!

1464
01:45:52,541 --> 01:45:54,750
I'll meet him, Try and make him
understand! Give me the number.

1465
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:57,875
No.
Atleast allow me to meet him.

1466
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:03,083
Let me try at least!

1467
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:07,458
You wanted to meet him once.
You did. So that's it.

1468
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:10,458
Alright. I want a liquor bottle.

1469
01:46:10,541 --> 01:46:11,458
Now give me his number.

1470
01:46:12,416 --> 01:46:13,291
Whatever!

1471
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:18,958
I want premium stuff from him.
Give me his number.

1472
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,416
There are more than 100 bottles
in my room.

1473
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:22,750
Take all of them.

1474
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:24,291
Give me his number.

1475
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:25,458
- Please
- Good night, dad.

1476
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,958
What do you think
I won't be able to find him!

1477
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:30,541
Good night.

1478
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:32,000
Good. Night.

1479
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:35,208
Con Artist!

1480
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:39,458
I think this is the one.

1481
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,291
Yes, Take the next right,
Inside the building.

1482
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,083
Uncle.

1483
01:47:04,125 --> 01:47:05,041
Can I come inside!

1484
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:06,333
Yes, Yes. Of course.

1485
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:17,250
Amazing abs you have.

1486
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:22,291
One, two, Three, four,

1487
01:47:23,291 --> 01:47:28,833
five, six. Best. Very strong!

1488
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:33,666
Like father like daughter!
Uncle Have a seat!

1489
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,833
Where?

1490
01:47:38,166 --> 01:47:40,125
Where can one sit in this mess!

1491
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,000
Isn't this house excessively full?

1492
01:47:53,916 --> 01:47:58,958
There are clouds as well.

1493
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:04,791
I think it will start raining
at any point of time now!

1494
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:05,875
Rain!

1495
01:48:12,583 --> 01:48:17,000
A for Apple, B for bread

1496
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:19,541
Oh sorry, Burnt bread!

1497
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:26,708
You might not know
how to use the dustbin, no!

1498
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:33,375
Oh my goodness!

1499
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:36,125
Pile of used utensils!

1500
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:38,250
Do you need some water!

1501
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:42,041
This place is no less than an art gallery!

1502
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,333
Yes!

1503
01:48:43,875 --> 01:48:47,458
This is a museum. Is there anything left!

1504
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:49,125
The bedroom.

1505
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:57,375
What's that?

1506
01:48:57,916 --> 01:48:58,750
What?

1507
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:03,666
Okay, I get it. Vasco-da-gama
might have ordered this pizza!

1508
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,750
This place is indeed one in a million.

1509
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:11,291
So, uncle, what can I help you with?

1510
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:12,833
Nope, Nothing.

1511
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:15,583
How did you find the address?

1512
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:19,541
I asked for the list of tourists
from Ahmedabad to Kedarnath!

1513
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:20,833
And that's it!

1514
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,416
You do have quite the extensive network!

1515
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:25,791
Okay bro okay. We will be there.

1516
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:27,083
Done, Done.

1517
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,458
Bro There is an order of 35 nos.

1518
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,375
From Mr. Prashant in shilaj

1519
01:49:33,291 --> 01:49:34,500
We will talk later, bro

1520
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:35,291
Hmm.

1521
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:36,416
We will talk later.

1522
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:37,833
Uncle, have a seat!

1523
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:41,166
Nope, I'll take your leave now!

1524
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,083
At least have some water!

1525
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:44,791
I am fasting today!
Step aside!

1526
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:49,416
Who was this?

1527
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,625
Trisha's father, man!

1528
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:52,875
Now who is Trisha bro?

1529
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,166
Yes.

1530
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:00,666
Why are you at Vishal's?

1531
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:05,625
Very good. He is a fast reporting person.

1532
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:06,708
Why?

1533
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:11,083
I got a bit emotional
after listening to his story!

1534
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:13,041
Dad, Please don't get
involved in all this stuff

1535
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:15,083
Nothing is going to change. So, stop it.

1536
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:17,208
When did I tell you that
something will happen!

1537
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:21,541
I just wanted to convince myself that

1538
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:23,791
he is a good guy.

1539
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:28,958
You will be happy with him.
But couldn't you find someone else?

1540
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:31,750
Not again!
I am so sorry!

1541
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,000
At his place

1542
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:37,375
He made an astray of pizza
which is a decade old. Crap!

1543
01:50:37,458 --> 01:50:38,291
What?

1544
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:40,333
What is this guy!

1545
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:44,958
Come home first,
we will discuss this later!

1546
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:46,500
Yes!

1547
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:54,875
There is no other option left!

1548
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,583
Yes sir, note down
an address for me please.

1549
01:51:18,458 --> 01:51:20,291
So, You are going to be a daddy!

1550
01:51:23,333 --> 01:51:24,166
Dad,

1551
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,333
Daddy,

1552
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:31,333
dad, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy...

1553
01:51:31,416 --> 01:51:32,583
Shut up you moron!

1554
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,125
Daddy, look. Daddy is here!

1555
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:35,958
- Come on guys. Come on.
- Uncle!

1556
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:36,916
Look at this place.

1557
01:51:37,125 --> 01:51:39,375
You need to make this place home!

1558
01:51:39,625 --> 01:51:41,125
- You guys go inside!
- Hello!

1559
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:43,208
- There is a sink full of utensils!
- Excuse me, hello!

1560
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:45,666
Clean that first. There
is a bedroom as well.

1561
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:46,791
Clean that too!

1562
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:47,791
Uncle, I'll clean this up!

1563
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:50,958
I've already called them, no!
They will do it.

1564
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:52,875
Let's go. Wear your jeans, we have to go!

1565
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:54,375
But, I need to deliver the bottles!

1566
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:55,083
Yes

1567
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,916
Those 35 nos. isn't it?

1568
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,791
Yes

1569
01:51:57,875 --> 01:51:59,208
You will deliver it, today!

1570
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,375
- He!
- But how will I manage all by myself!

1571
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:02,208
If you get caught then call me!

1572
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:03,666
Vishal has my number no!

1573
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:05,208
I'll take care of things, okay!
Let's go now. Come on.

1574
01:52:05,291 --> 01:52:06,583
I'll be back in just a minute!

1575
01:52:06,666 --> 01:52:08,041
There is no need to call Trisha!

1576
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,541
Come on, let's go!

1577
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:11,041
At least let me wear my jeans!

1578
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:12,125
Here it is!

1579
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:13,083
This won't match!

1580
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:14,458
Wear it in a lift!

1581
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,458
Yeah, But my shoes.

1582
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:16,166
There it is!

1583
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:16,708
These are

1584
01:52:16,791 --> 01:52:19,208
I'll get you a new one! Let's go!

1585
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,666
Here are your shoes!

1586
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:23,791
Let me buckle it up!

1587
01:52:23,875 --> 01:52:25,083
No one is there. Sit in the car!

1588
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,291
- You are there no!
- Sit now!

1589
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,250
Okay, Okay!

1590
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,083
Idiot, Where are we going!

1591
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:31,250
Can't he just stay quiet for a while.

1592
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:33,250
Irritating idiot!

1593
01:52:33,916 --> 01:52:35,333
Driver, Take us to the City centre!

1594
01:52:38,208 --> 01:52:39,875
Come. Let's go!

1595
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:43,541
Here?

1596
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:48,250
Come on. I am asking you, no?
Come with me.

1597
01:52:51,791 --> 01:52:52,666
Uncle!

1598
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,916
See what a nice place.

1599
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:56,750
It is a very big store!

1600
01:52:57,333 --> 01:52:58,541
You don't have to do anything!

1601
01:52:58,625 --> 01:53:00,791
You just have to sit here!

1602
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:04,791
Everyone will do their role.

1603
01:53:05,416 --> 01:53:08,166
In the evening you'll have
to count the cash, that's it!

1604
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,166
Hello, Mr. Rajesh!
How are you?

1605
01:53:12,375 --> 01:53:13,875
Come with me.
How are you?

1606
01:53:14,333 --> 01:53:15,000
How are you sir?

1607
01:53:15,083 --> 01:53:17,791
I was here for the store only!
Deal is on right?

1608
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:18,708
Yes. There are frequent
inquiries though!

1609
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:19,833
Consult me once, Please!

1610
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:21,625
What do you say Vishal?

1611
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,333
Uncle, I can't sell sarees!

1612
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:27,583
No?

1613
01:53:29,083 --> 01:53:30,333
I have other options as well!

1614
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:31,625
- But
- I'll call you Mr. Rajesh!

1615
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:35,250
Look at this! Spear Lounge-Rooftop cafe!

1616
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:36,708
This is a very popular place!

1617
01:53:36,916 --> 01:53:41,583
Once it's open it will
be full in minutes!

1618
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:43,791
And you don't have to do anything here.

1619
01:53:44,208 --> 01:53:46,666
You can come here whenever you want to!

1620
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:50,416
Manager takes the order,
Chef will make the food!

1621
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,041
Waiter serves the food
and the cashier collects the cash!

1622
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:55,291
Everyday this cafe collects in lakhs!

1623
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:59,041
You can come at night, Have a coffee.

1624
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:01,208
And you won't even have
to prepare food for yourself!

1625
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:05,833
Uncle, I mean. It's not like that!
I can manage myself

1626
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:07,041
This is not okay as well?

1627
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,583
It's good but

1628
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:13,375
I have another option. Come on.

1629
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:15,625
You won't be able to deny it.

1630
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:18,333
Now what is this!

1631
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:22,250
Just step inside and you'll be saying

1632
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:26,041
WOW! It is indeed a grand showroom!

1633
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:30,791
Now over here if you will
come at a gap of 2-3 days,

1634
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:32,041
that would be okay as well.

1635
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:35,041
Customers visit this place,
place their order.

1636
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:38,500
Sale and purchase department
settles within themselves.

1637
01:54:38,583 --> 01:54:39,875
We don't have to worry!

1638
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:42,833
It's too much now!

1639
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:45,416
Not even this!

1640
01:54:45,791 --> 01:54:46,666
No

1641
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:49,166
I have a brilliant idea, Come.

1642
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:55,041
What about this? Isn't it something?

1643
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:57,833
This whole unit makes
the machine of the labels

1644
01:54:57,916 --> 01:55:00,083
which can be glued on medicine bottles,

1645
01:55:00,166 --> 01:55:04,458
oil, shampoo, bottles etc.

1646
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:06,833
This business has solid profit!

1647
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:13,791
And more importantly you can visit
this place just once in a week!

1648
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,875
So what do you say!

1649
01:55:15,583 --> 01:55:16,583
Should jump from here?

1650
01:55:16,833 --> 01:55:19,291
If you'll land in a machine then
there will be a label on you as well!

1651
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:20,208
It already has on my head!

1652
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:21,375
Hello uncle. How are you?

1653
01:55:21,583 --> 01:55:23,083
Hii Yash. How are you, dear?

1654
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:23,833
All good uncle!

1655
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:24,875
Where is your father?

1656
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:26,166
He is out for a meeting!

1657
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:26,750
Okay!

1658
01:55:27,083 --> 01:55:28,333
Have we met before?

1659
01:55:28,416 --> 01:55:29,291
Bro!

1660
01:55:30,125 --> 01:55:31,500
He is our client.

1661
01:55:31,583 --> 01:55:33,000
He is a true lover of Jhonny!

1662
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:34,041
What! Bro it's not that

1663
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:35,833
So he is your client!
Seriously?

1664
01:55:36,041 --> 01:55:37,375
No, no. It's a joke!

1665
01:55:37,458 --> 01:55:38,583
Should I tell your dad?

1666
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:39,375
No uncle!

1667
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:40,916
Cancel! This deal is cancelled!

1668
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Tell your father that there
is no deal between us!

1669
01:55:42,083 --> 01:55:42,666
But uncle!

1670
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,666
Let's go to the next target!

1671
01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:45,541
- Sorry man. Sorry!
- Uncle, It was a joke only!

1672
01:55:45,583 --> 01:55:48,083
Come. This is the most peaceful
business environment ever!

1673
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:52,500
You don't even have to visit this place!

1674
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:56,541
Patients will come, Doctors will treat
them and the owner earns money!

1675
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,083
Mr Nimesh had told me about you

1676
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:00,583
Trisha, Your dad has gone mad!

1677
01:56:00,666 --> 01:56:01,708
Please save me!

1678
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:03,541
I hope this message reaches her!

1679
01:56:03,625 --> 01:56:05,916
So Vishal, What do you say!

1680
01:56:08,333 --> 01:56:09,166
Nope!

1681
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,083
Let's go to a very Cute place then!

1682
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:14,666
Cute?

1683
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:15,791
No, no, no. Please Uncle!

1684
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:16,583
This is an amazing business, man!

1685
01:56:16,666 --> 01:56:17,916
Please, Please uncle.
No, no. It's not done.

1686
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,666
- At least have a look!
- What is this, Please!

1687
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:22,625
Try and understand!
This is growing business dear!

1688
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:23,541
It runs on auto mode!

1689
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:24,208
I don't want to do this!

1690
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:25,958
If you wish to come then you can,

1691
01:56:26,041 --> 01:56:27,041
if you don't want to visit this place!

1692
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:28,166
I don't want to be any part of it!

1693
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:30,375
In case you get bored, then get a spa!

1694
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:32,541
Life will be full of fun!

1695
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:33,500
DAD!

1696
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:39,000
Oh god!

1697
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:41,916
Thank god!
Trisha!

1698
01:56:44,875 --> 01:56:46,125
Hey, Hey. Easy, easy.

1699
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,666
I don't want to be in this spa business!

1700
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:50,833
What?

1701
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:54,541
She just can't keep her nose out.

1702
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:01,250
Tell her, tell her everything! Nincompoop.

1703
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:15,291
This coffee is getting cold!

1704
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:16,625
It's cold coffee!

1705
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:29,625
Seriously dad! Spa

1706
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,125
If you get bored, get a spa!

1707
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:38,041
What to do? How should I settle him?

1708
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:39,375
I am settled, uncle!

1709
01:57:40,625 --> 01:57:42,125
Yes, You definitely are!

1710
01:57:42,208 --> 01:57:44,500
Why do you want to settle him?

1711
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:49,833
So, that you can live with him!

1712
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,083
We are going to live together!

1713
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:52,041
No!

1714
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:56,333
Dad, we don't have
feelings for eachother!

1715
01:57:56,416 --> 01:57:57,583
That is fine!

1716
01:57:58,416 --> 01:57:59,541
Once you start living together,

1717
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:01,416
you both will gradually start
feeling for each other!

1718
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,833
Just a minute, Let me be clear!

1719
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:07,916
Uncle, You as a father,

1720
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,041
want us to live in a live-in?

1721
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:17,291
You...
I can't even curse you!

1722
01:58:19,666 --> 01:58:20,625
Stop laughing!

1723
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:28,000
Okay!

1724
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:35,166
I am telling you very seriously!

1725
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,083
Dear

1726
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:41,166
I do not want to marry him.

1727
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:42,375
Even I don't want to marry her!

1728
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:43,750
- I am just a kid uncle!
- Yes

1729
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:45,791
Were you not a kid when
you wanted make a kid with her!

1730
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:46,958
She started it!

1731
01:58:47,041 --> 01:58:47,625
Hey, shut up!

1732
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:48,541
Be quiet!

1733
01:58:57,583 --> 01:58:58,708
Are you out of your mind?

1734
01:59:07,666 --> 01:59:08,458
- Listen to me
- Listen dear

1735
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:09,208
Trisha, what I am saying

1736
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:10,166
Don't interrupt!

1737
01:59:11,791 --> 01:59:12,666
Okay!

1738
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:20,791
- Dad, listen to me
- Listen to me first!

1739
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:21,708
Please, let me complete dad!

1740
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:23,041
No, Let me speak first, Then you!

1741
01:59:23,125 --> 01:59:24,541
But at least listen what I am saying

1742
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:25,625
I want to speak!

1743
01:59:25,708 --> 01:59:27,125
Okay. Go on.

1744
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:34,541
See dear,

1745
01:59:38,458 --> 01:59:45,458
you both are the parents of this child!

1746
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:49,291
Tomorrow when he goes to school,

1747
01:59:49,375 --> 01:59:51,916
they will ask
Who is the father of this child?

1748
01:59:56,208 --> 01:59:58,458
You might give them
some answers and you Vishal,

1749
01:59:59,041 --> 02:00:02,208
You might not be answerable.

1750
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:09,250
But when he grows up,
five years old or ten years old,

1751
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:13,250
then if he gets asked
"who is your father?"

1752
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:19,916
Let it be, If on a fine day he feels

1753
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:27,416
"I want to play with my father,

1754
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:33,583
I want to see my parents together,

1755
02:00:35,666 --> 02:00:37,291
like actually side by side!

1756
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:40,416
I want to sleep nestled between them,

1757
02:00:40,458 --> 02:00:42,250
feeling their warmth
and love all around me!"

1758
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:48,833
You guys want to take
this all away from him!

1759
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:02,291
See dear, at this point you
are not afraid of society

1760
02:01:02,375 --> 02:01:05,875
because you have that sense
of security that...

1761
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:11,125
If you will get stuck somewhere

1762
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:13,000
or in a decision making situation

1763
02:01:13,083 --> 02:01:15,416
you feel that no one is supporting me

1764
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:16,833
or no one is with me at
that point of time you know

1765
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:19,125
That your dad is standing
right behind you.

1766
02:01:19,958 --> 02:01:20,791
He got your back!

1767
02:01:22,708 --> 02:01:26,625
You are confident that

1768
02:01:26,916 --> 02:01:30,708
You are confident that till
my father is by my side,

1769
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:33,041
no one's father even dares to

1770
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:35,125
ask you who is the father of this child.

1771
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:44,583
But this child would
not be able to say it, no!

1772
02:01:53,333 --> 02:02:00,416
Don't just think about yourselves.
Don't be that selfish!

1773
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,333
Think about this child. Your child!

1774
02:02:04,541 --> 02:02:06,666
There is only one solution to all this!

1775
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:09,458
Get married!

1776
02:02:11,041 --> 02:02:14,041
Marriage

1777
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:22,166
I told you whatever I had to!
Now it's all up to you!

1778
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:25,375
Marriage

1779
02:02:44,833 --> 02:02:45,708
I am in.

1780
02:02:46,375 --> 02:02:48,875
I am ready. I will get married.

1781
02:02:49,333 --> 02:02:50,708
For my child.

1782
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,250
Life without parents
is just like living in hell,

1783
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:54,375
I know.

1784
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:57,125
I won't let that happen to my child!

1785
02:02:57,208 --> 02:03:02,041
But But But.
I won't give up on my business!

1786
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,291
It established this with
my blood and sweat!

1787
02:03:09,375 --> 02:03:11,541
It all went in vain!

1788
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:14,583
Yes uncle. I went to jail twice
to set this business up.

1789
02:03:14,791 --> 02:03:17,541
It's all set now,
I worked hard to make contacts.

1790
02:03:17,625 --> 02:03:18,916
Build a network

1791
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:20,833
Our slogan is hit uncle,

1792
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:24,708
"All Ahmedabad 24x7,
Just A call for premium Stuff!"

1793
02:03:25,625 --> 02:03:26,750
What a crazy Guy!

1794
02:03:32,166 --> 02:03:33,458
You want to tell him anything else!

1795
02:03:33,541 --> 02:03:34,375
Yes.

1796
02:03:35,416 --> 02:03:37,833
I give you the blessing that

1797
02:03:37,916 --> 02:03:40,875
your business overtakes
pablo-escobar's business.

1798
02:03:40,958 --> 02:03:41,833
What!

1799
02:03:44,166 --> 02:03:45,875
Look at him. How is he laughing!

1800
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,416
Come on, dad!

1801
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,458
Listen dear.

1802
02:04:01,416 --> 02:04:06,250
If you guys will spend some time together

1803
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:10,458
then things will sort out automatically!

1804
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:17,958
You get it, no?

1805
02:04:28,375 --> 02:04:29,291
My child

1806
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,125
hope you understand

1807
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:05,791
I am sorry, Dad!

1808
02:05:09,666 --> 02:05:11,166
Don't feel bad! My dear!

1809
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:15,708
Leave us!

1810
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:25,208
If you don't feel comfortable, call me.

1811
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:27,875
I'll be here immediately. Okay?

1812
02:05:29,541 --> 02:05:33,291
And between you

1813
02:05:34,166 --> 02:05:35,666
and him you are the matured one

1814
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:44,125
so you not only have to be
his but also his mother!

1815
02:05:51,125 --> 02:05:56,125
Once he gets attached to you

1816
02:05:56,208 --> 02:06:00,000
then slowly gradually
he will leave his bad dids'.

1817
02:06:00,416 --> 02:06:01,458
But you'll

1818
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:06,458
have to be patient! Hmm?

1819
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,875
Come I'll drop you!

1820
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,708
Vishal?

1821
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:45,625
Hii!

1822
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:46,708
Why are you standing there like a statue?

1823
02:07:46,791 --> 02:07:47,625
Come inside! Please.

1824
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:48,000
Yes

1825
02:07:48,041 --> 02:07:52,125
Welcome. This is my friend 'Bhuvan'!

1826
02:07:52,875 --> 02:07:54,125
Hii, Trisha!

1827
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:58,208
I told you, no? Trisha!

1828
02:08:00,125 --> 02:08:01,000
Hii

1829
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:02,125
Tell her!

1830
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:07,875
Hii

1831
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:09,625
what!

1832
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,166
Bro what are you doing?

1833
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,333
I knew that his processor would
start lagging after seeing you!

1834
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:39,708
Come, please have a seat!

1835
02:08:40,166 --> 02:08:40,916
His processor, Come on!

1836
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,625
- Let me show you the place, come.
- Yeah, but just a minute.

1837
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:45,416
See, this is the terrace.

1838
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,708
I spent most of my time over here only.

1839
02:08:46,791 --> 02:08:47,875
This is my favourite spot.

1840
02:08:47,958 --> 02:08:49,750
And the sunset you get to see
from here is amusementifying!

1841
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:50,458
Amusementifying?

1842
02:08:50,541 --> 02:08:52,791
Ohh, You were just late,
or you could have seen it!

1843
02:08:52,875 --> 02:08:54,000
But no worries we'll see that tomorrow!

1844
02:08:54,083 --> 02:08:55,083
Come on, come on! Let's go!

1845
02:08:55,166 --> 02:08:57,041
I need to show you the rest of the house!

1846
02:08:57,125 --> 02:08:59,541
Hey, hey, hey. Easy! Leave me, your
hands are feeling a bit too heavy!

1847
02:08:59,625 --> 02:09:00,625
You are heavy

1848
02:09:11,125 --> 02:09:12,083
All because of you!

1849
02:09:16,125 --> 02:09:17,750
Let's go ahead, you can laugh out later!

1850
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:19,416
This is where mom used
to perform the rituals.

1851
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:22,000
If you want to do it over here,
do let me know I'll clean it up!

1852
02:09:22,458 --> 02:09:23,291
Okay!

1853
02:09:24,583 --> 02:09:25,875
It's still not done yet! Come on!

1854
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:28,083
Vishal, Take away your hand!

1855
02:09:28,916 --> 02:09:30,500
This is the service table
and that is the kitchen!

1856
02:09:30,583 --> 02:09:32,166
I make delicious food!

1857
02:09:32,583 --> 02:09:33,250
Is that so?

1858
02:09:33,333 --> 02:09:34,333
Yes! Have you had dinner?

1859
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:35,833
Yes!

1860
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:38,041
No worries. Tomorrow I'll cook
something for you!

1861
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:42,541
Now, To the main part!

1862
02:09:46,333 --> 02:09:47,166
After you!

1863
02:09:57,458 --> 02:09:58,666
But where?

1864
02:09:59,000 --> 02:09:59,875
Here only!

1865
02:10:07,166 --> 02:10:08,916
Our bedroom!

1866
02:10:17,125 --> 02:10:18,291
Our bedroom!

1867
02:10:20,791 --> 02:10:21,833
- Come on!
- What!

1868
02:10:21,916 --> 02:10:23,208
Don't laugh like this!

1869
02:10:24,125 --> 02:10:25,333
Then what should I do?

1870
02:10:26,375 --> 02:10:27,833
There are still a few things left!

1871
02:10:31,791 --> 02:10:32,750
After you!

1872
02:10:38,458 --> 02:10:39,458
This is the bathroom!

1873
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,208
Is everything alright with the house?

1874
02:10:47,875 --> 02:10:50,375
Will it be comfortable enough for you?

1875
02:10:50,666 --> 02:10:51,875
Hmm.

1876
02:10:52,333 --> 02:10:54,666
It's Fine. I'll be fine...

1877
02:10:56,333 --> 02:10:57,125
Oh god!

1878
02:10:57,208 --> 02:10:58,625
Let's sit outside?

1879
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:02,208
Okay, I'll change.

1880
02:11:10,291 --> 02:11:11,458
Can I stay?

1881
02:11:17,166 --> 02:11:19,083
Nope, You can not stay.

1882
02:11:19,166 --> 02:11:20,833
But I've already seen you!

1883
02:11:21,125 --> 02:11:23,541
Hey, Get out now!

1884
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:26,541
Get up and get out now?

1885
02:11:26,625 --> 02:11:28,041
Please!

1886
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:30,875
Please, Get lost!

1887
02:11:34,333 --> 02:11:35,458
What was this?

1888
02:11:36,375 --> 02:11:37,250
I am leaving.

1889
02:11:38,666 --> 02:11:41,375
Okay, bye now.

1890
02:11:55,833 --> 02:11:56,833
I'll beat you up!

1891
02:11:56,916 --> 02:12:00,083
It's not like that! It was itching only!

1892
02:12:00,166 --> 02:12:01,083
Yuck!

1893
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,791
I don't want to listen to that!

1894
02:12:08,583 --> 02:12:09,583
Come over here!

1895
02:12:10,791 --> 02:12:11,791
Ladies first!

1896
02:12:11,958 --> 02:12:12,666
You first!

1897
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:14,208
- I am no lady!
- Yes, but you first!

1898
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:19,666
Come on, You!

1899
02:12:26,958 --> 02:12:27,875
Take away the pillow!

1900
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:29,250
Enough, You'll be beaten now!

1901
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:30,791
Okay, Okay!

1902
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,916
Seriously!

1903
02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:48,083
Do you want to watch T.V.?

1904
02:12:48,416 --> 02:12:51,000
No. You can if you want to.

1905
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,250
T.V., I watch it everyday.

1906
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:57,083
Today, I want to watch you!

1907
02:12:57,875 --> 02:12:59,958
It was a very cheap pick-up line!

1908
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:01,833
You are blushing anyways!

1909
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:03,833
Blush!

1910
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:09,125
I am not blushing!
I can't control my laughter!

1911
02:13:10,958 --> 02:13:12,000
Do you want to see my abs?

1912
02:16:07,333 --> 02:16:10,375
Vishal, Let's sleep!

1913
02:16:14,083 --> 02:16:14,916
Okay, Come on!

1914
02:16:15,625 --> 02:16:16,916
Seriously?

1915
02:16:18,375 --> 02:16:19,208
I am coming!

1916
02:16:19,375 --> 02:16:20,416
Don't follow me!

1917
02:16:25,166 --> 02:16:26,083
Trisha

1918
02:16:26,291 --> 02:16:27,791
Just go and sleep over there quietly.

1919
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:42,541
Good night.

1920
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:15,166
My stomach is hurting
because of laughing continually.

1921
02:17:15,416 --> 02:17:17,333
The sort of faces he makes,

1922
02:17:17,875 --> 02:17:19,875
I keep laughing looking at his face only.

1923
02:17:20,791 --> 02:17:23,666
He is literally childish!

1924
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:25,458
Haha, That's what I told you.

1925
02:17:26,375 --> 02:17:29,916
He is childish, not mischievous.

1926
02:17:32,083 --> 02:17:33,708
Will you be able to sleep?

1927
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:35,916
Yes Dad.

1928
02:17:36,625 --> 02:17:38,458
Don't worry about anything.

1929
02:17:38,541 --> 02:17:39,958
You sleep tight, dad!

1930
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:42,250
Yes, I'll sleep in a while!

1931
02:17:43,458 --> 02:17:45,083
I disrupted your sleep, didn't I?

1932
02:17:45,666 --> 02:17:47,791
Don't think like that! I am fine!

1933
02:17:47,875 --> 02:17:49,625
I'll manage myself! Don't worry.

1934
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,625
Okay, Don't worry. Sleep tight.

1935
02:17:55,125 --> 02:17:56,041
I am happy only.

1936
02:17:56,875 --> 02:17:59,000
He is very caring
and he is taking good care of me!

1937
02:17:59,625 --> 02:18:02,041
Okay dear, Take care.

1938
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:04,250
Good night dad.

1939
02:18:04,875 --> 02:18:05,791
Good night.

1940
02:18:13,583 --> 02:18:14,375
Trisha

1941
02:18:14,458 --> 02:18:16,333
Oh god!

1942
02:18:19,416 --> 02:18:21,208
Are you sure that
you don't wanna do anything?

1943
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:29,375
Oh god. Put it down. Put it down.

1944
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:35,333
What's this, what are you doing?

1945
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:45,583
It's the last warning, Leave now.

1946
02:18:49,375 --> 02:18:50,208
Fine!

1947
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:53,375
Good night!

1948
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,500
See you in the morning.

1949
02:19:14,583 --> 02:19:15,250
Vishal

1950
02:19:15,333 --> 02:19:18,791
What, Hehehehe

1951
02:19:21,958 --> 02:19:25,916
Close your mouth. That's it.

1952
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:29,416
Listen, stop playing games with me.
I won't be good then.

1953
02:19:30,791 --> 02:19:31,625
Okay!

1954
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:32,958
What okay?

1955
02:19:33,041 --> 02:19:33,500
Okay!

1956
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:35,041
What does that mean!

1957
02:19:42,041 --> 02:19:44,458
Hehehe Oh my god!

1958
02:20:20,125 --> 02:20:20,958
Should I come?

1959
02:20:23,041 --> 02:20:25,958
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

1960
02:20:26,041 --> 02:20:27,541
Easy, I am carrying a baby!

1961
02:20:29,541 --> 02:20:30,375
Oh

1962
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:33,708
Sorry, Sorry.

1963
02:20:35,625 --> 02:20:36,500
Are you okay?

1964
02:20:36,583 --> 02:20:37,541
Vishal

1965
02:20:44,166 --> 02:20:45,333
Let's not do it no?

1966
02:20:55,041 --> 02:20:55,875
Should we cuddle?

1967
02:21:49,875 --> 02:21:51,416
Who would it be now?

1968
02:21:51,916 --> 02:21:54,375
Just a second. Just give me a second.

1969
02:21:54,666 --> 02:21:57,208
I'll be right back. In a second.

1970
02:22:03,541 --> 02:22:05,791
Why are you not picking up
Mr.Yash's calls? He called me.

1971
02:22:07,083 --> 02:22:08,041
I wasn't aware!

1972
02:22:09,125 --> 02:22:10,000
He needs Three bottles of whiskey.

1973
02:22:10,083 --> 02:22:11,916
I asked him to double
the amount and he agreed!

1974
02:22:21,083 --> 02:22:22,750
It's okay. You stay here.
I'll manage this.

1975
02:22:23,416 --> 02:22:24,291
No, wait

1976
02:22:26,125 --> 02:22:27,000
- Come on, man.
- I am coming along

1977
02:22:27,083 --> 02:22:28,000
Wait, wait.

1978
02:22:28,958 --> 02:22:31,125
You should stay here with her.
I'll deliver this today!

1979
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:32,083
Are you sure?

1980
02:22:32,416 --> 02:22:33,375
Yes dude. You stay here.

1981
02:22:35,458 --> 02:22:36,000
Stay alert!

1982
02:22:36,083 --> 02:22:36,958
Yeah!

1983
02:22:41,958 --> 02:22:42,833
Who was it?

1984
02:22:43,416 --> 02:22:44,291
It was Bhuavn.

1985
02:22:45,375 --> 02:22:47,750
Nothing serious. He left.

1986
02:22:57,416 --> 02:22:58,916
Should we continue the hug?

1987
02:24:17,458 --> 02:24:18,291
Sleep now!

1988
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:43,625
Sorry!

1989
02:24:45,208 --> 02:24:46,041
It's okay!

1990
02:24:50,083 --> 02:24:50,916
Hello

1991
02:24:54,125 --> 02:24:54,958
Oh!

1992
02:24:56,208 --> 02:24:57,166
Is Mr. Digvijay there?

1993
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:00,458
Okay fine. I am on my way!

1994
02:25:00,625 --> 02:25:01,583
- Just a minute
- Sure

1995
02:25:03,791 --> 02:25:05,000
Is there any problem?

1996
02:25:05,375 --> 02:25:06,583
No, I'll be right back!

1997
02:25:07,125 --> 02:25:08,500
You can share!

1998
02:25:08,583 --> 02:25:10,541
Bhuvan has been arrested.

1999
02:25:11,291 --> 02:25:12,666
I'll go, get him out. Okay?

2000
02:25:13,291 --> 02:25:14,416
I'll call my dad!

2001
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:16,166
See, don't call anyone.

2002
02:25:16,458 --> 02:25:17,541
I'll handle it.

2003
02:25:18,333 --> 02:25:20,416
Don't panic, I'll be back soon.

2004
02:25:20,458 --> 02:25:22,541
Listen, Should I come along?

2005
02:25:22,833 --> 02:25:25,166
Stay here Trisha. I'll manage this. Okay?

2006
02:25:26,291 --> 02:25:27,125
You go to sleep.

2007
02:25:27,916 --> 02:25:29,708
Let's go. I am coming with you.

2008
02:25:29,791 --> 02:25:32,875
Listen, I have already done this!

2009
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:34,541
I told you no, I am coming!

2010
02:25:34,625 --> 02:25:35,875
Trisha

2011
02:25:39,458 --> 02:25:41,166
You will come with me
to the police station,

2012
02:25:41,625 --> 02:25:42,666
I won't like it.

2013
02:25:44,375 --> 02:25:45,250
Please.

2014
02:25:49,666 --> 02:25:50,583
Don't panic.

2015
02:26:26,958 --> 02:26:27,791
Hey, you. Sit down.

2016
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:28,333
Yes

2017
02:26:28,416 --> 02:26:29,333
Where is digvijay sir?

2018
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:30,875
Sir went home to sleep.

2019
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:32,291
When will he be back?

2020
02:26:32,625 --> 02:26:33,541
Tomorrow morning.

2021
02:26:38,458 --> 02:26:41,083
Can talk to him on the phone?
Should I call him?

2022
02:26:41,708 --> 02:26:43,875
If you want to disturb his
sleep then go ahead!

2023
02:26:44,666 --> 02:26:47,083
Let it be now. Meet him tomorrow.

2024
02:26:47,708 --> 02:26:50,083
If you disturb him now
then this will take a long time!

2025
02:27:10,708 --> 02:27:11,708
Hey, Sit down!

2026
02:27:27,083 --> 02:27:29,166
Hello, Hii.

2027
02:27:29,250 --> 02:27:31,333
Yeah, it seems like I'll be back
in the morning only.

2028
02:27:32,833 --> 02:27:35,833
Yes, sir went home to sleep. So!

2029
02:27:36,875 --> 02:27:40,875
No. Don't worry.
I'll be home in the morning.

2030
02:27:41,833 --> 02:27:43,833
Sleep tight, Okay?

2031
02:27:45,541 --> 02:27:47,666
Okay, Bye.

2032
02:28:24,916 --> 02:28:27,208
You should go home and stay with her.

2033
02:28:27,458 --> 02:28:28,375
Come back in the morning.

2034
02:28:28,458 --> 02:28:29,291
No, I am staying.

2035
02:30:07,458 --> 02:30:08,500
Hello, dad!

2036
02:30:28,375 --> 02:30:30,041
Do you have iPhone's charger?

2037
02:30:30,666 --> 02:30:32,083
Are you using an iPhone?

2038
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:36,208
You want one? Should I get you one?

2039
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:37,250
What do you want to get?

2040
02:30:37,458 --> 02:30:38,875
Nothing sir. iPhone.

2041
02:30:39,125 --> 02:30:40,625
He is giving us an iPhone.

2042
02:30:40,916 --> 02:30:43,875
Dude, We are happy with
this phone only. Go.

2043
02:30:46,041 --> 02:30:47,416
Go? Means?

2044
02:30:47,916 --> 02:30:49,208
I got a call from sir.

2045
02:30:49,291 --> 02:30:50,791
He asked me to let go of both of you.

2046
02:30:51,375 --> 02:30:52,625
Get up you small-pants!

2047
02:30:52,708 --> 02:30:53,250
Get up.

2048
02:30:53,333 --> 02:30:54,208
Come on.

2049
02:30:54,291 --> 02:30:55,208
Get up, idiot.

2050
02:30:55,541 --> 02:31:00,625
Yes, he warned that next time it's an FIR
no more warnings.

2051
02:31:00,916 --> 02:31:01,750
Hmm.

2052
02:31:02,291 --> 02:31:02,916
Sure?

2053
02:31:03,083 --> 02:31:03,500
Hmm.

2054
02:31:03,583 --> 02:31:04,416
Keep it moving now.

2055
02:31:08,166 --> 02:31:09,333
Hey, give me a cigarette.

2056
02:31:12,583 --> 02:31:13,583
What did you do there?

2057
02:31:13,666 --> 02:31:14,708
Get on the bike now.

2058
02:31:15,833 --> 02:31:17,541
Bro, please talk to them and sort it out.

2059
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:19,958
Spending the whole night
in lock-up is tough, man.

2060
02:31:20,041 --> 02:31:21,416
Come on. Sit now you idiot.

2061
02:31:21,916 --> 02:31:22,666
Give me the cigarette.

2062
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:23,625
I don't have any.

2063
02:31:23,708 --> 02:31:24,875
Stop at the store.

2064
02:31:27,958 --> 02:31:29,375
Go ahead, I'll get some cigarettes.

2065
02:31:35,666 --> 02:31:36,541
Trisha!

2066
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:40,333
Trisha

2067
02:31:40,458 --> 02:31:41,333
Trisha

2068
02:31:44,875 --> 02:31:45,750
Trisha

2069
02:31:46,083 --> 02:31:48,250
No, no, no.
No, no, no. Please,

2070
02:31:48,333 --> 02:31:49,625
please, Please.

2071
02:31:52,375 --> 02:31:53,791
Trisha

2072
02:31:56,375 --> 02:31:58,208
Please, please, please pick up.

2073
02:32:23,958 --> 02:32:24,833
Trisha

2074
02:32:26,666 --> 02:32:27,291
Trisha

2075
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:28,333
Vishal!

2076
02:32:28,583 --> 02:32:29,541
Vishal!

2077
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:31,291
Trisha!
Why did you come back here?

2078
02:32:31,541 --> 02:32:32,416
I forgot a few things.

2079
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:33,583
So, I am here to take them.

2080
02:32:34,041 --> 02:32:36,250
- Why are you here?
- Then why didn't you answer my calls.

2081
02:32:37,166 --> 02:32:38,166
I missed it.

2082
02:32:38,708 --> 02:32:40,916
But I did call you back.
You didn't pick up.

2083
02:32:41,083 --> 02:32:41,958
Call back?

2084
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:44,875
Mr. Vishnu

2085
02:32:44,958 --> 02:32:45,500
Yes madam.

2086
02:32:45,583 --> 02:32:46,166
Give him some water.

2087
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:47,125
Yes.

2088
02:33:05,291 --> 02:33:06,375
Let's go.

2089
02:33:07,375 --> 02:33:08,250
Sit down.

2090
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:12,166
But why do you want to sit?

2091
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:13,625
Sit-sit.

2092
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:22,875
Have some water!

2093
02:33:23,333 --> 02:33:24,250
I don't want water!

2094
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:34,833
Dad must be coming.

2095
02:33:35,625 --> 02:33:36,916
We will leave after meeting him.

2096
02:33:38,708 --> 02:33:39,750
When will he come back?

2097
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:42,833
He must be coming, Now.

2098
02:33:50,541 --> 02:33:53,583
Why did you come here running?

2099
02:33:54,541 --> 02:33:57,666
Trisha, I thought you were gone!

2100
02:33:59,000 --> 02:33:59,750
Like literally.

2101
02:33:59,833 --> 02:34:00,750
What?

2102
02:34:01,166 --> 02:34:04,375
Yes, I was having these stupid thoughts
for the whole time in the police station.

2103
02:34:05,083 --> 02:34:06,708
I was there for only three to four hours.

2104
02:34:06,791 --> 02:34:08,666
But I missed you by a XXL amount.

2105
02:34:09,083 --> 02:34:12,500
XXL amount, from where are
you fetching these words!

2106
02:34:13,458 --> 02:34:18,166
Dude you are laughing! I was very tense!

2107
02:34:18,666 --> 02:34:19,583
That I can see.

2108
02:34:22,666 --> 02:34:25,416
Vishal, relax.

2109
02:34:26,125 --> 02:34:27,666
Calm yourself.

2110
02:34:31,666 --> 02:34:33,291
I am going to be with you.

2111
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:42,791
Trisha, you are

2112
02:34:42,875 --> 02:34:44,083
Ohh

2113
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:48,458
Hey, are you crying or what?

2114
02:34:52,125 --> 02:34:54,208
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

2115
02:34:54,291 --> 02:34:56,833
Trisha, Come on.

2116
02:34:58,041 --> 02:34:58,875
Sorry

2117
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:04,000
Sorry-sorry.

2118
02:35:06,291 --> 02:35:07,000
Listen.

2119
02:35:07,083 --> 02:35:08,625
Ohh. Okay, okay.

2120
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:15,958
What?

2121
02:35:16,041 --> 02:35:16,708
Will you

2122
02:35:16,791 --> 02:35:18,833
Ouch. Okay!

2123
02:35:27,708 --> 02:35:28,583
Trisha

2124
02:35:28,916 --> 02:35:29,750
Hmm.

2125
02:35:31,958 --> 02:35:38,875
I mean I wanted to tell you something!

2126
02:35:39,208 --> 02:35:40,083
Hmm

2127
02:35:46,291 --> 02:35:51,291
I am experiencing some different feelings.

2128
02:35:51,375 --> 02:35:52,208
Hmm?

2129
02:35:54,791 --> 02:35:57,500
For the first time
I've felt this different!

2130
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:01,666
What Different?

2131
02:36:02,125 --> 02:36:02,958
See this.

2132
02:36:03,083 --> 02:36:06,500
Nobody has taken a leaf from my hair!

2133
02:36:07,375 --> 02:36:08,916
Come on.

2134
02:36:11,791 --> 02:36:12,625
Hmm.

2135
02:36:13,916 --> 02:36:15,666
All of these feelings.

2136
02:36:18,541 --> 02:36:19,750
I am talking about them.

2137
02:36:22,875 --> 02:36:24,458
Same feelings!

2138
02:36:24,916 --> 02:36:25,791
What?

2139
02:36:35,291 --> 02:36:37,125
I've been to the police
station before, but

2140
02:36:39,166 --> 02:36:40,708
I was never afraid.

2141
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,291
I was afraid today.

2142
02:36:46,583 --> 02:36:50,291
If I steal a bike and go out for delivery,

2143
02:36:50,375 --> 02:36:52,166
I might get caught
and I'll have to go to jail

2144
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,375
then I won't be able to meet you.

2145
02:37:00,916 --> 02:37:01,541
Hmm.

2146
02:37:01,583 --> 02:37:04,083
What if you get upset and leave me
by the time I get out of it?

2147
02:37:14,833 --> 02:37:17,000
I have a blurry memory

2148
02:37:21,041 --> 02:37:23,458
of sleeping with my mum and hugging her.

2149
02:37:25,583 --> 02:37:26,458
And last night,

2150
02:37:29,250 --> 02:37:30,583
I hugged you while sleeping.

2151
02:37:33,875 --> 02:37:35,791
That feeling was...

2152
02:37:45,333 --> 02:37:48,791
I want to hug you and sleep, daily.

2153
02:37:50,916 --> 02:37:52,583
Can we be together for a lifetime?

2154
02:37:59,458 --> 02:38:01,083
You dad was right,

2155
02:38:04,625 --> 02:38:05,958
Should we get married?

2156
02:38:10,541 --> 02:38:12,041
I'll leave all of this and move on.

2157
02:38:16,416 --> 02:38:17,250
For you,

2158
02:38:20,875 --> 02:38:22,083
for our baby.

2159
02:38:25,083 --> 02:38:26,291
I'll find something else.

2160
02:38:26,875 --> 02:38:28,125
I am super manly.

2161
02:38:28,208 --> 02:38:31,250
I'll money anyhow,
that too legally.

2162
02:38:33,208 --> 02:38:34,083
God!

2163
02:38:39,458 --> 02:38:40,291
- Trisha
- Yes!

2164
02:38:45,166 --> 02:38:46,000
What is your take?

2165
02:38:49,666 --> 02:38:50,791
Should we get married?

2166
02:38:50,875 --> 02:38:51,750
Yes!

2167
02:38:53,041 --> 02:38:54,375
For a lifetime let's be together?

2168
02:38:54,583 --> 02:38:55,458
Yes!

2169
02:38:58,125 --> 02:38:59,000
Yes?

2170
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:04,375
Oh, you accepted my proposal very quickly.

2171
02:39:05,791 --> 02:39:06,666
Then no!

2172
02:39:08,041 --> 02:39:08,875
No?

2173
02:39:09,166 --> 02:39:13,458
No, Try and convince me more.

2174
02:39:14,416 --> 02:39:15,750
Then I will accept your proposal.

2175
02:39:17,375 --> 02:39:19,708
How much more should I convince you?

2176
02:39:27,833 --> 02:39:29,291
I see you are down to earth now!

2177
02:39:29,458 --> 02:39:34,375
Uncle. Thank you, Thank you.
Thank you, thank you so much.

2178
02:39:36,833 --> 02:39:38,000
What is he up to?

2179
02:39:40,416 --> 02:39:43,208
I didn't know you had this
much bigger contacts!

2180
02:39:44,208 --> 02:39:44,708
Contacts?

2181
02:39:44,791 --> 02:39:45,500
Yes uncle.

2182
02:39:45,708 --> 02:39:47,291
Just a single call from you
and my friend was out of jail.

2183
02:39:47,375 --> 02:39:48,208
Thank you.

2184
02:39:50,083 --> 02:39:51,458
Is he like this?

2185
02:39:51,916 --> 02:39:53,625
I have been laughing since yesterday!

2186
02:39:54,541 --> 02:39:56,291
Uncle, I want to get married.

2187
02:39:56,375 --> 02:39:57,750
And so does Trisha. We both are ready.

2188
02:39:57,833 --> 02:39:59,250
I will put an end to my off
the book businesses.

2189
02:39:59,333 --> 02:40:00,125
I have savings of 25 lacs.

2190
02:40:00,208 --> 02:40:01,083
- I will find something.
- Listen

2191
02:40:01,166 --> 02:40:03,666
You don't have to worry about Trisha.

2192
02:40:03,750 --> 02:40:04,916
I am full of daring.

2193
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:05,791
I will earn the money.

2194
02:40:05,875 --> 02:40:07,416
Without any support
from you I will be settled.

2195
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:09,541
I won't keep a foot inside
the police station,

2196
02:40:09,625 --> 02:40:12,208
- I am promising you that, uncle.
- Hey, stop. Stop.

2197
02:40:12,291 --> 02:40:14,083
Give me a break.

2198
02:40:14,916 --> 02:40:17,250
We will sit and talk this through.

2199
02:40:17,541 --> 02:40:21,041
I am sweating all over due
to running. At Least let me change.

2200
02:40:21,083 --> 02:40:22,833
Let us go, no?
Let's go!

2201
02:40:23,291 --> 02:40:25,083
You won't stop, would you?
Sit down.

2202
02:40:26,041 --> 02:40:26,916
- Uncle
- Yes

2203
02:40:27,916 --> 02:40:28,916
Let us go no!

2204
02:40:29,166 --> 02:40:30,000
Go back

2205
02:40:30,500 --> 02:40:30,916
Back?

2206
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,125
Go back now.

2207
02:40:32,875 --> 02:40:33,541
But let us go, no?

2208
02:40:33,625 --> 02:40:34,958
Now sit.

2209
02:40:35,541 --> 02:40:37,791
At least let me take a napkin!

2210
02:40:37,875 --> 02:40:39,291
Okay, I am waiting.

2211
02:40:41,750 --> 02:40:42,583
Come on, let's go!

2212
02:40:43,375 --> 02:40:44,375
Vishal!

2213
02:40:44,458 --> 02:40:46,791
I want to dance so bad
and hug you so tight.

2214
02:40:46,875 --> 02:40:48,833
I want to go home
and dance at maximum volume,

2215
02:40:48,916 --> 02:40:51,291
I want to kiss you uninterrupted.

2216
02:40:51,375 --> 02:40:52,208
Stop.

2217
02:40:54,041 --> 02:40:56,250
Stop my stomach is hurting.

2218
02:40:58,666 --> 02:41:01,375
Uncle isn't here yet. Give me a kiss.

2219
02:41:01,416 --> 02:41:02,166
Vishal, dad!

2220
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:03,083
What happened?

2221
02:41:03,208 --> 02:41:05,083
You denied a kiss, no?
I will take from your dad now!

2222
02:41:05,166 --> 02:41:06,041
Uncle!

2223
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Did he just kiss me?

2224
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:11,541
She denied it so I took it from you.

2225
02:41:11,625 --> 02:41:12,916
Now I won't stay here even
for a micro second!

2226
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,333
Hey Look, Vishnu fell-off!

2227
02:41:14,416 --> 02:41:15,416
Come on, let's go!

2228
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:16,750
Hey, where are you going?

2229
02:41:16,833 --> 02:41:17,666
Let her go. Hey.

2230
02:41:17,875 --> 02:41:19,791
You can also join us.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

2231
02:41:19,875 --> 02:41:21,958
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let go of me. Take her.

2232
02:41:22,541 --> 02:41:23,791
But my belongings!

2233
02:41:23,875 --> 02:41:25,125
We'll get new belongings,
You just come!

2234
02:41:25,208 --> 02:41:26,583
- Hey, be careful.
- Come on.
