1
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:47,656
Oh, man!

2
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,563
Did you see that?

3
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,286
Oh, my God.

4
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,566
Yes! Yes!
Nice, nice, nice.

5
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,234
Sick!
Worth the wait.

6
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,161
Oh, babe. You missed out.

7
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:00,819
Yes!

8
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,428
That was intense, man.

9
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,786
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

10
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:24,532
Yeah, maybe for you but our lives
are actually going somewhere.

11
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,732
Ok, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

12
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,536
Because our pass is for 9:15.

13
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,027
If we miss that, we'll stand in line

14
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,305
for like a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

15
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:32,232
Ok!
Alright?

16
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,245
So let's go.

17
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:36,603
Ok. Come on,

18
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,541
it won't kill us to get
a deep fried Snickers and a Coke.

19
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,951
Before riding Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

20
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,544
No! What doesn't kill you,

21
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,305
makes you stronger, man.

22
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,096
I'll take that.

23
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,570
No. Come on, give me.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

24
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,242
It's the yearbook's.
Just Kevin.

25
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,066
Got it.

26
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,480
Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
Hey. Hey. Give me the...

27
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,409
Nice.

28
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,614
Could you like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

29
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,623
These are for the yearbook.

30
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,787
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline

31
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,128
and like I doubt it

32
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,202
if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe

33
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,352
is gonna make it in there.

34
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,879
I'd buy two.

35
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,401
Number 38, your order's ready.

36
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,239
That's us.

37
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,419
I am so sorry.

38
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,218
Kevin can get so out of control.

39
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,888
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

40
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,811
I mean, you know,

41
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,154
I'm such a control freak like...

42
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,545
I couldn't handle that.

43
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,476
I'm breaking up with him.

44
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,071
Couple of weeks.

45
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,182
After graduation.

46
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:54,656
I've been wanting to for a while.

47
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,726
But don't tell anybody, ok?

48
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,428
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

49
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:03,958
I love it.
I love it.

50
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,537
Oh, alright, so I'm a total whore.

51
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,864
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

52
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,309
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

53
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,369
Am I winning?
Yeah, come on, hurry!

54
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,278
Ok, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

55
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,382
Am I winning? look around,
I don't want to look.

56
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,616
You're totally winning.

57
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:21,829
Come on, come on, come on!

58
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,287
Don't look! Oh, my God! Come on!

59
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,302
I'm winning! I'm winning!

60
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:30,674
I won!
I knew you would.

61
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,111
Oh, my God!

62
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,527
Give me my prize.

63
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,540
That was so awesome, Ashley.
Good job.

64
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,274
Ashley.

65
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,847
How you doing, my brother?
You having a good time?

66
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,605
You like that?

67
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:50,713
Yeah! You like it.

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,407
Give it up. Give it up.

69
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,492
Sam!

70
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:01,612
Excuse me.

71
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,245
You're not a senior.

72
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:09,130
And what are you gonna do about
Miss Cutest Couple, Rah Rah?

73
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,039
Mom know you're here?

74
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,434
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

75
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:16,614
Proof.

76
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:17,654
Where you were.

77
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,818
Take a shot of this.

78
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,585
That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

79
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,058
<i>♪ That is three, number three ♪</i>

80
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,824
<i>♪ Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man ♪
♪ Man, I am hot. ♪</i>

81
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,413
Man, give me some right here, man.
Right here! Right here!

82
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,959
What you doing?
Get the fuck back.

83
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,438
My God, I am good.
Here we go.

84
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,129
Boy, I'll tell ya. Goddamn.

85
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,362
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

86
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:49,950
Here we go. Here we go.

87
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,135
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

88
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,682
<i>♪ That's what I'm talking about ♪</i>

89
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,485
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

90
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,610
That's the one we gonna get.

91
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,551
<i>You can run,</i>

92
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,273
<i>but you cannot hide.</i>

93
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,366
Yes!
Here we are, baby.

94
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,514
There it is.

95
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:24,533
Awesome.

96
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:26,141
Here, get a pic of this.

97
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,008
<i>This is the beginning of the end.</i>

98
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,871
Hey, guys, get in line.

99
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,451
What's wrong?

100
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:44,924
I'm...

101
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:48,286
I was having that feeling
like déjà vu, you know?

102
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,207
Except for...

103
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,466
something that hasn't happened yet.

104
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:52,331
Hey, J.

105
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:53,832
Come on man, let's go.

106
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,745
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Come on.

107
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,475
What, are you weirded out by the ride?

108
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,760
Because look I know you.

109
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,238
And I think that maybe...

110
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:04,535
you're nervous about this
roller coaster because

111
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,610
they say the real fear with these rides

112
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,402
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

113
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,016
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

114
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,620
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

115
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,726
Never.

116
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,353
Ok.

117
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,209
<i>You can run, but you cannot hide.</i>

118
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,118
Where you guys are right now

119
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:26,902
if you raise your hands it's just...

120
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,306
cup them slightly...

121
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

122
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,629
And we'd wanna do that why?

123
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,876
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

124
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,322
I'm looking at one right now.

125
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,533
Man, you guys are smoking hot.

126
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,884
Get out, Frankie.

127
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,256
Yeah, why are you even here?

128
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,387
Yeah, you graduated, like two years ago.

129
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,378
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

130
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,191
Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

131
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,219
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

132
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:55,461
<i>You may never return
from Devil's Flight.</i>

133
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,289
You're totally sad.

134
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,112
Try not to scream!

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,623
That was totally awesome!

136
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,316
Yeah! Sweet!

137
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,242
You alright?

138
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,770
There's nothing to worry about.

139
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,136
A roller coaster is just elemental physics.

140
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:48,030
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

141
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,556
Yep, odds are like one in 250 million
of dying in a roller coaster.

142
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,516
Yeah, thanks for that, McKinley.

143
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,789
You're more likely to die,
driving to an amusement park than.

144
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:58,101
Dying at one.

145
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,906
Here we go.

146
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:17,900
You like this?

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,537
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

148
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,152
You know that ladder deal that wobbles?

149
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,148
Took it.

150
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:25,696
I like this.

151
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,124
It's old school.

152
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:29,981
Frankie Cheeks is old school, ladies.

153
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,369
What's that?

154
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,846
Well, it'd be my honor.

155
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:37,495
Let's go.

156
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,863
Hey... Baby.

157
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,839
How many?

158
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:40,822
Four.

159
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,042
Four?
Yeah.

160
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:43,742
Gate one.

161
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,871
Yeah. Front car.
Yes!

162
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,036
No. No, wait please.

163
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,642
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just, I can't sit in the front.

164
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,675
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

165
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,736
Ok.

166
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,656
Take it easy.

167
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,422
Ok, we'll sit in the back
are you right babe?

168
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,199
Why me? Because we're girls?

169
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:02,450
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

170
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,148
I'm sitting in the front.

171
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,306
J, just go, ok? I'll live.

172
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,657
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

173
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,666
Alright, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

174
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,489
How about that? Call it.

175
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:12,296
Heads.

176
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,149
Shit! Damn it.

177
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,474
Alright, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

178
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,306
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

179
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,869
Hey, just do me a favor.

180
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,711
Keep an eye on her, ok?
She's kinda freaked out.

181
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,034
Oh. Cool.
Alright?

182
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,947
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

183
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,204
Here we go.
Hey!

184
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,369
J! Keep your hands to yourself, man.

185
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,720
I'm serious.
You know, payback's a bitch, ok?

186
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,323
You know, she might need
some comforting...

187
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,953
and I'll be there for her. ok?

188
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,411
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

189
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:16,636
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

190
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,714
No. Get...

191
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,147
Let's just get in the back, ok?

192
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,796
Guess who's back?

193
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:32,456
Hey!

194
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:35,596
I'll meet you at the end.

195
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:39,288
Here! Alright!

196
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,134
Cool!

197
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:42,375
Hey.

198
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,002
How'd you guys get in here?

199
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,604
What? I'm 55 inches.

200
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:47,371
Sure. Come on out.
Oh, man.

201
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,731
You, too. Out.

202
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:49,557
Ready?

203
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:53,570
You ok?

204
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,606
Come on. Here we go.

205
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:01,505
Yeah!

206
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,407
What's up, man? I'm good.

207
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:15,018
Dare you to, flash me them sweet,
sweet titties when we go through the loop.

208
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,435
Alright.

209
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:27,878
Yo!

210
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,896
What, you can't read?

211
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:35,356
Can I just put it in my pocket, man?

212
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,274
Is that cool?
Yeah.

213
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,127
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

214
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,184
Shit!

215
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,109
Here you go!

216
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,834
Win, baby! Yes, baby! Win!

217
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,374
Come on!

218
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:12,711
Come on. Get hyped.

219
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:14,046
The first hill's so high.

220
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:16,978
This is what we need!

221
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,274
Let's do this!
Just win!

222
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:07,944
Shit!

223
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:18,743
Oh, man.

224
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,715
Oh, my God!

225
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,712
Here we go!
Oh, my God!

226
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,559
Oh, my God!

227
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:20,481
Yeah! Show me your titties!

228
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:21,746
Fuck off, Frankie!

229
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:46,167
Oh, shit!

230
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,640
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

231
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,833
No!

232
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:38,492
Kevin!

233
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:40,128
No!

234
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:55,359
No!

235
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,999
Erin, hang on!

236
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:12,599
Erin!

237
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,884
Hang on!
Don't let go!

238
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,897
I can't.

239
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:20,585
No!

240
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,468
Oh, God!

241
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,595
Hang on, Wen.

242
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,521
Hang on! Help me rock it!

243
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:41,900
Almost got it!

244
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:43,428
Gently.

245
00:18:58,401 --> 00:18:59,121
No!

246
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,019
Yo. What, you can't read?

247
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,890
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, ok?

248
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,679
Yeah.

249
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:13,650
Thanks, bro.

250
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,297
Alright.
Let's do this, Wen...

251
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:17,357
What're you...

252
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:18,677
Here you go!

253
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,024
Yeah! Let's do it, baby!

254
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,030
We have to get off of here.

255
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,994
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

256
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,002
Let me off! Let me off!

257
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,062
Wen, Wen! It's alright.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

258
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,101
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

259
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:32,799
Wendy?

260
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,732
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

261
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:38,006
What's going on?
Let me off!

262
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,338
Chick's on something.

263
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,433
It's alright! You'll be ok!

264
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:41,500
Ok, let them out. Just the back.

265
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:42,932
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

266
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,775
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

267
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,568
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

268
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:53,119
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

269
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,919
No, she was just a little upset before.

270
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,983
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

271
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,143
Damn.

272
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,713
It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!

273
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,820
Man, she's just trying to get
some fucking attention.

274
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,318
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

275
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:05,743
Fuck you.
Fuck moi?

276
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,400
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

277
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:11,340
Just relax!

278
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,671
Fight, man!

279
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,767
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

280
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,402
Nobody else gets off this ride!

281
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,379
Dude, let me off.

282
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,710
So high school.

283
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:19,796
Let's out.

284
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,940
Calm down!
Get off of him!

285
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,008
Relax!
Ian!

286
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,544
Where you ladies going?

287
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:24,709
There's a fight.

288
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:25,555
Get him out of here!

289
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:26,540
Relax hey!

290
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:28,325
Calm down! Relax!

291
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,856
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's ok.

292
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,368
Relax! Calm down!

Fuck.

309
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,297

310
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,492
Stop it! Please!

311
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,150
Please, the tracks are broken.

312
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:58,139

Jason!

315
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:03,692
Hey, just relax, ok?

316
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:06,012
Please!
Ease up, man. She's alright.

317
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:07,267
Ok? Just let her settle down.

318
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,730
She can settle down at home!
Now listen.

319
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,557
What is your home phone number?

320
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,569
Ok, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

321
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:17,931
Oh, my God!

322
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,139
Jason!

323
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,328
Hey, Wendy!

324
00:22:58,388 --> 00:22:59,121
Hey!

325
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:00,742
Wait!

326
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:01,874
Wendy!

327
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,936
Hey! Hey, Wen.

328
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:05,501
Wait I need, I need to talk to you
about something.

329
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:07,511
Just here to pick up my diploma.

330
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:08,957
You're not going to graduation?

331
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:09,615
No.

332
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:12,629
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place.

333
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:13,459
Ok?

334
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:15,632
God I mean,

335
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:17,884
I just thought maybe,
it'd be good for you to be somewhere...

336
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,716
where other people feel the same way.
At graduation?

337
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:20,304
No.

338
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,890
Thanks. I've had enough funerals.

339
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:23,628
Then do it for J and Carrie.
Do what?

340
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:25,851
If you die, then there's nothing
then you're just dead,

341
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,965
and they don't know.

342
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,897
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi

343
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,195
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

344
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,074
I am alive and I don't care.

345
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:36,441
As soon as I pull out of that
parking lot I am so out of McKinley.

346
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:38,682
Without J, what's here for me?

347
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,111
I'm here. ok?

348
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,358
I made a promise to J that
I would take care of you.

349
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:45,329
On the ride.

350
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:47,156
For 3 minutes.

351
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:49,010
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

352
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,001
Kevin,

353
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,104
if it wasn't for you and J being friends,

354
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,989
and me and Carrie being friends...

355
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,358
we wouldn't have even hung out.

356
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:01,801
We don't even like each other.

357
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:12,665
Ian McKinley.

358
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,607
How pathetic is it that my last name...

359
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,278
is the same as my high school?

360
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,185
Julie, look who I got to sign my yearbook.

361
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:23,023
No way. Nice.
Yeah.

362
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:32,588
I think we should invite her.

363
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,357
You think?
Yeah.

364
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:39,679
Wen?

365
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:43,101
So we're ready for graduation tonight,

366
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:45,226
we're going to the tanning salon after this,

367
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:47,847
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

368
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,008
Totally.

369
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,109
And just like, talk if you want.

370
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,610
Here's my cell.

371
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,523
I already have your number.

372
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,253
That was so nice of us.

373
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,606
You're not alone.

374
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,573
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

375
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,737
Ok? I really do.

376
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:17,360
No, it's happened before.

377
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,293
Ok? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

378
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,708
Wendy, just, just listen to me alright?

379
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,968
Alright, look, I went online

380
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:26,722
looking for an explanation
about what happened,

381
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:29,182
and I found out about this high
school French class,

382
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,017
from New York, six years ago...

383
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,946
they went on a trip to Paris.

384
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:34,219
When they were boarding...

385
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,647
a kid had a vision,

386
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:37,012
that the plane was gonna explode.

387
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:38,720
Just like you did.

388
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,778
He freaked out...

389
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,494
and seven people got off the plane.

390
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:47,527
Just like us.

391
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,204
And on takeoff,

392
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,547
Flight 180 blew up.

393
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:55,921
And over the next several months,

394
00:25:56,261 --> 00:25:57,711
everyone who got off that plane,

395
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:59,288
started dying in weird accidents.

396
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,421
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

397
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,510
Unless someone intervened,

398
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:06,921
then it skipped them.

399
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:08,735
Fuck you, Kevin.

400
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:12,098
Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

401
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:39,310
Every time we come here.

402
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:42,317
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

403
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:45,527
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

404
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

405
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,593
I mean we're still pretty bronzed.

406
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,501
I was just thinking
we could go for like a tune-up.

407
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:53,335
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

408
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,236
Yeah.

409
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:56,368
You know, for all those kids
that died that night

410
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:58,375
who will never get a graduation.

411
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,571
You know what?
You're totally right.

412
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:02,975
I'm sorry.

413
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,927
This is my,

414
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,347
my good guy luck bracelet
that Grandma left me in her will.

415
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:36,028
Julie?

416
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,448
I need...

417
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,723
I could use some help.

418
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:47,983
I have such...

419
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,837
such guilt over Jason.

420
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,392
I should never have let that ride go.

421
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:55,475
God.

422
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:58,220
I'm usually such a control freak
but I didn't...

423
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,638
do enough to stop it,
I should've done everything I could,

424
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:01,931
to stop it.

425
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:05,817
And I would give anything,

426
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:08,224
to have a second chance.

427
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:12,684
But I never can.

428
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:20,164
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

429
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,248
I mean, I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

430
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,681
You're all I have left.

431
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:33,231
You think when I find a place maybe you
could come stay with me for a while?

432
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:36,991
You know I will.

433
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:41,352
You...

434
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,836
keep this now...

435
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:45,992
and...

436
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,910
I'll get it when I come see you.

437
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:51,217
And... Hey...

438
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:52,690
how about on your end?

439
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,940
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

440
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:56,848
Yeah.

441
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,969
As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

442
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,167
Done.

443
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:04,344
Actually, the battery is pretty low so...

444
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:07,317
why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

445
00:29:07,668 --> 00:29:08,431
Cool.

446
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,351
In a hurry, Yuri.

447
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:27,444
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

448
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:29,197
I think tanning beds mess with signal.

449
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,757
I must go outside.

450
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:33,596
Why don't you just use that phone?

451
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:36,763
I would but, she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

452
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:39,772
Shit. That's her.

453
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:43,077
You know what just go outside.

454
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:44,254
We can deal with this ourselves.

455
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:44,925
Ok.

456
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:48,271
Hey.

457
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:50,911
No drinks in the room this time, ok?

458
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:52,721
Good.

459
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:06,225
What are you doing?

460
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,572
Nobody is walking in here
and seeing me naked.

461
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,467
Oh, my God.

462
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,114
Dude, he said no drinks.

463
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:02,565
If you spill that shit we're gonna
have to clean it up like last time.

464
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:07,344
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

465
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:11,656
Why does Yuri keep it so cold in here?

466
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:14,429
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

467
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,523
A few degrees won't hurt.

468
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,206
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

469
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:45,680
Sucks, bitch.

470
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:47,593
They got CDs.

471
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,171
Dion Celine?

472
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,999
Britney?

473
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:57,443
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

474
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,397
Yeah.

475
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:02,937
Whatever.

476
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,287
Why are you wearing underwear?

477
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,485
Steinmetz says he gets off on tan lines.

478
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,752
Alright.

479
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,357
Camera charged?

480
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,941
Sorry, the battery's totally dead.

481
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:51,784
Camera's not working. Sorry.

482
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:57,978
Look Julie, I need a minute, ok?

483
00:35:58,485 --> 00:35:59,434
Like private.

484
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,279
It's way too warm in here now?

485
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,514
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

486
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:57,543
<i>Hello?</i>

487
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:58,996
Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...

488
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,803
<i>Psych! Leave a message.</i>

489
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:03,546
Hi Ashley, this is Wendy.

490
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,375
Give me a call whenever
you guys are done.

491
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:07,262
And thanks again for the invite.

492
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:08,539
Someone help!

493
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,846
Sorry I was too late.

494
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:45,583
Hey, open the door!

495
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,807
Help me!

496
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:13,905
We may feel...

497
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,199
that our lives are not our own.

498
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:18,826
That Death controls,

499
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:20,645
frames our lives.

500
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:23,605
Our birth's nothing but death begun.

501
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:28,498
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives.

502
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,371
Which we have suffered much of late...

503
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:33,925
or with the soft...

504
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:36,197
passing of the elderly in the night...

505
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:38,638
we are all...

506
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,639
equal...

507
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,681
in Death's eyes.

508
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,226
Equal...

509
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:44,911
in Death's eyes?

510
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:47,056
All of us?
How can you say that?

511
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,181
Shut up, McKinley.

512
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,307
Dude, think it through.

513
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:51,054
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

514
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,949
Osama? Still kicking.
Let's go.

515
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:53,903
Pimps,

516
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,688
vice-presidents walking around.

517
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,198
All the atrocities...
Let's just go. Come on.

518
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,273
They've committed,

519
00:38:58,637 --> 00:38:59,899
They're alive and well.

520
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,244
These two girls,

521
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,845
who'd never done shit to anybody,

522
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:05,720
they don't get to make it to 18?

523
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,918
Where's the fucking equality in that?

524
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:09,908
What?
Come on, man.

525
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:10,628
Yeah.

526
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:11,737
Fine.

527
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:13,002
Fine. Alright. Alright.

528
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:14,596
I'm fine. Alright.

529
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:16,696
That's crazy.

530
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:21,642
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance,

531
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:24,295
please step forward at this time.

532
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:33,952
I so feel this is so my fault.

533
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,977
How could it possibly be your fault?

534
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:39,623
Seeing women as nothing
but fun bags.

535
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:41,075
I mean,

536
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:43,366
if I'd've seen their...

537
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,496
whatever,

538
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:46,803
humanity...

539
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:49,823
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

540
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,877
Impress Franklin Cheeks.

541
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,754
Go on diets.

542
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:54,762
Deodorize.

543
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,734
Stretch.

544
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:57,874
Tan.

545
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:00,644
Don't be down, Frankie.

546
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:04,892
Be proud of your ability to make everything
that happens somehow a story about you.

547
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:10,461
God!

548
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:23,180
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

549
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:25,560
Fucking boring.

550
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,027
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

551
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,648
man, bring me a PSP or something.

552
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,455
At least I have something to do then.

553
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,994
Hello?

554
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,193
<i>I'm with J.</i>

555
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,382
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

556
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:15,995
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

557
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:18,495
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

558
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,542
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

559
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,299
spirit or presence or...

560
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:28,813
whatever.

561
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,333
But now that I'm here...

562
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:35,980
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

563
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:39,291
it's a cemetery.

564
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,978
Yeah, I haven't felt Carrie's spirit either.

565
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:46,936
And I've tried.

566
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:49,689
Real hard.

567
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:54,333
I thought maybe...

568
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,312
he's been with me since...

569
00:41:58,504 --> 00:41:59,213
that night,

570
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,586
before I got on the ride...

571
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:03,759
Jason said...

572
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:06,846
God and it was just to get me
on the ride he said.

573
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,014
Your fear...

574
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:11,131
is from a sense of having no control.

575
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:15,264
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

576
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:17,981
Even thought it maybe somehow...

577
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:19,407
caused the hallucination.

578
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:22,663
But this fear is more
than just being scared.

579
00:42:24,387 --> 00:42:25,620
It's like a presence.

580
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,950
Like a living thing,

581
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,853
always with me.

582
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:33,354
You think it's J?

583
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:34,754
No, I know it's not.

584
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,668
This presence is the opposite,

585
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:39,217
of how J made me feel.

586
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:41,297
It's cold...

587
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:43,852
and terrifying.

588
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:22,807
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

589
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,515
The photographic plate was broken
causing a line,

590
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,768
that can't be removed.

591
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,636
Exactly where he was shot.

592
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:31,388
Look.

593
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:32,802
See the shadow?

594
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,734
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

595
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:38,304
Look.

596
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,490
This occurred one year to the day
of the Flight 180 disaster.

597
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,570
Look at the road sign.

598
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,432
Look, I guess you came
to me with this,

599
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,548
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head

600
00:43:46,686 --> 00:43:47,914
with the Flight 180 thing.

601
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:48,989
And it did happen,

602
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:50,980
and it may be occurring here
but you can't believe,

603
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:53,047
every weird thing out there because
you're desperate for an answer.

604
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:54,294
I took these.

605
00:43:55,487 --> 00:43:56,171
That night.

606
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:05,434
These?

607
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:10,794
Are these it?

608
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:17,339
Oh, shit.

609
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:21,259
Oh shit.

610
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:28,476
Hey? You alright?

611
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,323
I'm feeling a little woozy.

612
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,527
When was the last time you ate?

613
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,010
I don't remember.

614
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,050
Alright. Come on I'll drive.

615
00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:45,713
Ok, those kids,

616
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,006
on Flight 180,

617
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,984
died in accidents in the order they would've
died if they'd have stayed on the plane.

618
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:51,802
Ok?
So if this is that...

619
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:52,841
then...

620
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:56,208
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

621
00:44:57,602 --> 00:45:00,295
When I saw Ashley and Ashlyn's
picture I felt this instinct.

622
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,761
Like there was a hint in the picture.
I even...

623
00:45:02,863 --> 00:45:04,616
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

624
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,643
Well, what's Frankie's picture look like?

625
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:07,588
It's right here.

626
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:09,110
You got it?
Yeah.

627
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:13,985
Wait! Watch out!

628
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:16,745
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

629
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:17,813
Sorry!

630
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:22,639
Alright, let's just eat over there.

631
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:24,075
And go through the drive through.

632
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,350
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

633
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:28,542
Well, it's nice to see that things haven't
made you any less of a control freak.

634
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:38,395
You got it?
Yeah, alright.

635
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:39,770
Here's Frank's picture.

636
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:40,824
Alright.

637
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:43,204
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

638
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:45,891
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

639
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:49,109
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.

640
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,095
Alright, what's...

641
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,528
Could there be anything in these prizes?

642
00:45:51,677 --> 00:45:53,815
Oh what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

643
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:57,747
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

644
00:45:59,366 --> 00:46:00,747
It's so sad that you know that.

645
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,180
Alright. He won that tacky mud-flap
girl chain on this game, though, so...

646
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,728
aren't those usually on
those big 18 wheelers?

647
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:08,561
Yeah. Yeah.

648
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:10,558
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

649
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:13,877
Alright! God.

650
00:46:17,803 --> 00:46:19,134
Alright.

651
00:46:23,064 --> 00:46:24,686
Can I take your order?
Yeah.

652
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,280
What do you want?

653
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:32,235
Are you ok?

654
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,844
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

655
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,566
That guy's way too close to my truck.

656
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,694
Hey, you're too fucking close, man!
Pull up!

657
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:51,664
Hey!

658
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,700
Stop! Stop!

659
00:47:01,747 --> 00:47:03,408
Watch out! Shit!

660
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:04,575
What the fuck?

661
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:06,310
Oh, my God!

662
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:08,811
Get out! Get out!
What? What?

663
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:10,515
Behind us!

664
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:11,921
There's no one in that truck!

665
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:15,154
Shit! Hey!

666
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,139
Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

667
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:22,619
Back up!

668
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,704
Back up!

669
00:47:30,374 --> 00:47:31,973
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

670
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,948
Come on. Let's go!
Come on, come on.

671
00:48:34,772 --> 00:48:35,817
We're all done here.

672
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,173
You need a ride?

673
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:40,983
We can walk to my house then...

674
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,563
I'll give you a ride to yours.

675
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,456
No, thanks. We'll be ok.

676
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:51,674
Will we?

677
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,424
Yeah. We'll be alright.

678
00:48:56,192 --> 00:48:57,154
I mean...

679
00:48:58,262 --> 00:48:59,292
how Frank...

680
00:49:00,164 --> 00:49:02,757
God, it's not only horrible
but can you feel...

681
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:05,230
can you feel how vicious it was?

682
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:06,112
Easy.

683
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:08,205
Ok? Easy.

684
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:11,358
Let's just...

685
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:13,385
just take a step back.

686
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,720
Alright? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride

687
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:18,777
but there was no ladder here.

688
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:19,774
You know there was no rope.

689
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:22,142
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

690
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:23,754
We were wrong about the photos.

691
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,646
I should've left town.

692
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,261
It's better not knowing.

693
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,206
No, it's never better staying ignorant.

694
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:32,132
Willful ignorance is surrendering control.

695
00:49:33,216 --> 00:49:34,080
What did you...

696
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,509
What did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

697
00:49:38,629 --> 00:49:39,184
No.

698
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:40,542
I, you know, I'm not...

699
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:42,416
I'm not the total idiot you think I am.

700
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:46,640
Ok, that's Lewis after Frank...

701
00:49:47,436 --> 00:49:48,629
then lan and Erin.

702
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:51,202
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

703
00:49:51,227 --> 00:49:52,754
because this guy's arm's in the way.
Can you?

704
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,807
No.

705
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:56,898
Alright you know what?
We'll ask Lewis,

706
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:58,420
lan and Erin if they remember.

707
00:49:58,627 --> 00:49:59,327
Ok?

708
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:01,927
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

709
00:50:16,592 --> 00:50:17,528
I guess...

710
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:21,328
that kind of thing is gonna happen
to us for the rest of our lives.

711
00:50:21,891 --> 00:50:22,687
Yeah.

712
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:25,801
You know, I was gonna...

713
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,040
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

714
00:50:30,754 --> 00:50:32,280
Right after graduation.

715
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:55,737
No, wait.

716
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:57,692
Look, behind Stacy.

717
00:50:58,482 --> 00:50:59,676
That's Frank.

718
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:02,410
This picture shows how he died.

719
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,144
Alright, go back to Lewis.

720
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:13,262
Ok, he's got that hammer.

721
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,040
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

722
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:17,997
on his head.

723
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,564
No, no, no, check this out right now.

724
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:21,926
Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

725
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:24,240
State's team is called the Sultans.

726
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:26,087
That's it. That's the clue.

727
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,906
We have to tell him.

728
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,514
Show him these pictures.

729
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,774
Wouldn't you want to know?

730
00:51:36,353 --> 00:51:37,718
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

731
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:38,906
Yeah.

732
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,586
Yeah, of course.

733
00:51:42,377 --> 00:51:43,880
No. No. I don't want to see mine.

734
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:44,463
No.

735
00:51:45,574 --> 00:51:46,871
What about willful ignorance?

736
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,522
Well, I'm full of shit, alright?

737
00:51:49,942 --> 00:51:52,463
I mean, I never thought I could see my
own death before it happened, Wendy.

738
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:55,798
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

739
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:58,323
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

740
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,371
I gotta stay focused and if I look at
that picture, all I'm gonna do is obsess.

741
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,238
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

742
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:08,711
I mean, unless we have to.

743
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,991
You mean until...

744
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:12,800
we have to.

745
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:19,668
One more thing.

746
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:21,814
Is it bad?

747
00:52:22,568 --> 00:52:23,587
I mean, is it like,

748
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:25,114
painful or embarrassing?

749
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:27,841
I mean there's nothing like up my ass

750
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:28,901
or anything right?

751
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:30,015
I'll see you tomorrow.

752
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:35,599
You on crack.

753
00:52:35,977 --> 00:52:37,372
Both of you.
Just listen.

754
00:52:37,396 --> 00:52:38,818
Ok, Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

755
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,177
Then Frankie Cheeks and then you.
This is the...

756
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:41,726
Come on Kevin.
Listen.

757
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:43,717
McKinley and Erin
were next, alright?

758
00:52:43,742 --> 00:52:45,548
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

759
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:46,735
Fuck no and I don't care.

760
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:47,899
And you shouldn't care either man,

761
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,087
because what you're telling me
right now is straight bullshit.

762
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,427
Just listen Lewis.

763
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:53,647
Kevin, it's like those stories.

764
00:52:53,763 --> 00:52:56,727
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

765
00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:58,830
Two sisters right,

766
00:52:58,854 --> 00:53:00,933
were killed when they were driving
to visit each other.

767
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:02,887
You know shit like that man.

768
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,606
Fuck the Bruins!

769
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,434
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

770
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,673
Bruin faggots!
Fuck the Bruins!

771
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:10,976
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

772
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:16,649
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

773
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,542
Three people have died, Lewis.

774
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,395
You think this can be written
off as a simple coincidence

775
00:53:21,496 --> 00:53:23,489
and it ends there you're in serious denial.

776
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:25,417
What about you two?

777
00:53:25,742 --> 00:53:26,492
What?

778
00:53:26,763 --> 00:53:29,682
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

779
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:31,867
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever,

780
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:33,631
seeing signs and patterns man.

781
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:35,700
I don't blame you.

782
00:53:36,538 --> 00:53:37,436
But it's wrong dawg.

783
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:39,338
It's wrong.

784
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:42,759
That's denial.

785
00:53:48,485 --> 00:53:50,278
Ok, what about what happened
at the roller coaster?

786
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:51,912
Wendy saw it.

787
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,176
Man she got a hunch.

788
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,688
Fucking intense, but she got a hunch.

789
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,319
Man I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

790
00:53:57,344 --> 00:53:59,284
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

791
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:00,724
Hers came to her from nowhere.

792
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,699
You're here and alive because of her.

793
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:04,122
No I'm alive because of me.

794
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,145
No listen.

795
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:07,361
You don't get it man.
Does that make sense to you?

796
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:09,040
There's nothing to get Kevin!
It's bullshit.

797
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,908
No just hear me out alright?

798
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:19,786
Talk about a vision.

799
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:20,996
Man I seen my whole life,

800
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,068
played out and it sure
as hell ain't gonna end now.

801
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:25,443
It's going just as I saw it.

802
00:54:25,908 --> 00:54:28,174
35 high school games without an injury.

803
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,046
USA Today All-American.

804
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,173
Second team.
Free ride to play for the Sultans!

805
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:34,353
The Bruins passed on you.
Man fuck the Bruins!

806
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:35,935
Fuck them!
You goddamn right!

807
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,991
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

808
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:43,838
Four years from now,

809
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:46,358
Lewis Romero going in
the second round to Oakland.

810
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,330
He's gonna romp and stomp.

811
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:53,604
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

812
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,310
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

813
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:58,402
Death is a fucking Denver fan.

814
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:00,155
Death wear blue and orange.

815
00:55:00,689 --> 00:55:02,702
Real men wear black.

816
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:04,486
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

817
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,226
Death is afraid of me!

818
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:08,206
Death fears me!

819
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,286
Kevin.

820
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,420
Because baby I just win.

821
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:11,651
I just win Kevin!

822
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:13,423
That's all I know how to do!

823
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:14,757
I just win!

824
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:17,002
Fuck Death!

825
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,100
Fuck the Bruins!

826
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:22,277
Look out!
Lewis!

827
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,227
Man, that was close, Lewis.

828
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,344
Hey, did you see that?

829
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:31,529
What I tell you, Kevin,

830
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,488
Fuck Death! I just win!

831
00:55:33,628 --> 00:55:34,957
That's all I know how to do Kevin.

832
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,461
Baby I just win!

833
00:55:39,614 --> 00:55:40,284
God!

834
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,833
Did I do something...

835
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,705
to bring this on everybody?

836
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:58,566
Don't, Wendy.

837
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:00,846
But why me?

838
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:04,181
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition,

839
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:05,980
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

840
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,727
I just want it to stop.

841
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:13,974
Just stop.

842
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:16,867
I don't know why, Wendy...

843
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,421
but you didn't do anything.

844
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,033
Alright?

845
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,403
This is just...

846
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,578
I don't know.
I mean I wish I knew why.

847
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,772
You know, I wish I could,
I could come up with a guess even...

848
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:30,083
to make you feel ok,

849
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:30,939
but...

850
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:35,238
I can't.

851
00:56:40,322 --> 00:56:41,695
There's nothing I can do.

852
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,675
Can you drive?

853
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:58,097
You know, by the way,
that, that picture of me.

854
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:58,945
My...

855
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:02,125
my head's not like,
through the windshield or anything?

856
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:04,843
You know, crushed by a steering wheel?

857
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:06,612
Impaled by a gear shift?

858
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:10,865
Right?

859
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:26,662
<i>Zip, it's Pip.</i>

860
00:57:26,702 --> 00:57:28,135
<i>Have you cut those plywood orders yet?</i>

861
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:29,627
That's a big no, Pip.

862
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:33,072
<i>Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.</i>

863
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:34,888
They keep setting off the alarms.

864
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,215
Hello, babies.

865
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:09,132
Hey.

866
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:13,181
After I restock this stuff that these
pinhead customers

867
00:58:13,206 --> 00:58:15,352
can't manage to return
to the shelves themselves

868
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,157
we can blow out of here, ok?

869
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:18,274
<i>Righty-o, babe.</i>

870
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,031
Erin!

871
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,358
It's Wendy and Kevin.

872
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:27,190
Shit!

873
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:29,493
You scared the shit out of me!

874
00:58:29,855 --> 00:58:31,216
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

875
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:43,132
<i>Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.</i>

876
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:45,652
<i>You are gonna trip when you hear this.</i>

877
00:58:46,045 --> 00:58:48,594
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

878
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:50,431
So let me get this straight.

879
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:53,121
I'm gonna O.D. on nail polish

880
00:58:53,374 --> 00:58:55,507
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

881
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:57,382
You saw what happened to Wendy.

882
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,934
Right? What's happened to the others?
We just saw their pictures.

883
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,436
Oh, my God guys, what's going on?

884
00:59:13,238 --> 00:59:14,789
What's going on?

885
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:16,432
That's crazy!

886
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:22,139
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

887
00:59:22,348 --> 00:59:25,715
Ok, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

888
00:59:27,178 --> 00:59:28,720
Oh, wait! Wasn't it that one guy

889
00:59:28,754 --> 00:59:31,451
who got voted most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

890
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,044
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

891
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,164
There was this guy,

892
00:59:34,189 --> 00:59:36,002
black cloak I didn't see his face but...

893
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,669
the ride attendant did take his sickle...

894
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,982
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

895
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:44,075
Do you think we care if you laugh at us?

896
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,377
This is our lives, ok?

897
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:47,687
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

898
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,566
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no it.

899
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,342
Ok, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is like a person?

900
00:59:52,378 --> 00:59:54,480
No. It's like, like a force.

901
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:57,165
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force...

902
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:58,471
is just a force.

903
00:59:58,784 --> 01:00:00,819
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

904
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:02,212
I mean,

905
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:04,506
it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

906
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,577
But there is awareness, McKinley.

907
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:07,967
In fact in past cases,

908
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:10,261
if the next in line is saved
it'd skip that person.

909
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,304
That's why we're here.

910
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:13,044
Oh man, what have you been smoking?

911
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:20,897
Top shelf.

912
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,025
Ok.

913
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,138
Kevin!

914
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:32,995
Those banners.
They're in the picture.

915
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:35,795
Ian, watch those boxes!

916
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:42,777
What the fuck, man?

917
01:00:42,802 --> 01:00:44,030
You said those boxes were falling!

918
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:45,710
No, I said watch the boxes.

919
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:47,425
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

920
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:50,001
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

921
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:52,679
You haven't seen or been through
what we have...

922
01:00:53,634 --> 01:00:54,304
yet.

923
01:00:55,105 --> 01:00:55,593
Yet.

924
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:59,206
Ok, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

925
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:01,611
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster

926
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:03,982
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

927
01:01:04,475 --> 01:01:06,728
We don't know if Ashley
or Ashlyn died first.

928
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:09,635
Death is fucking complicated.

929
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:13,308
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

930
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,284
It's simple.

931
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:15,785
People die.

932
01:01:15,828 --> 01:01:17,294
That's just part of life.

933
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:19,080
150,000 people a day,

934
01:01:19,104 --> 01:01:20,027
actually.

935
01:01:20,065 --> 01:01:21,005
You know? I mean...

936
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:23,626
we're biological entities,

937
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,511
and death is just...

938
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:26,587
Top shelf.
The end of biological function.

939
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:27,743
It's as simple as that.

940
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:36,781
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

941
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,626
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

942
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:41,142
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

943
01:01:41,186 --> 01:01:43,518
Does that not make sense to you?
Oh, yeah.

944
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:47,457
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

945
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:48,965
no one goes like...

946
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:52,289
He was eating French toast...,

947
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,240
when Princess Diana died in Paris,

948
01:01:54,265 --> 01:01:57,118
and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead?

949
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:59,082
You know why because
they'd sound crazy so

950
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:00,830
guess how you two sound right now?

951
01:02:01,402 --> 01:02:02,328
Crazy

952
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:04,915
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

953
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,462
so we can get out of here.
Ok!

954
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:14,204
Sick.

955
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:50,927
Ok.

956
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,654
Let's go with what you guys are saying.

957
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:55,368
Let's just say, you know...

958
01:03:55,574 --> 01:03:57,862
that Death does have a conscious plan

959
01:03:57,887 --> 01:03:59,554
and that it's been set into motion.

960
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,867
Great. So...

961
01:04:01,027 --> 01:04:02,410
Newton's third law of motion,

962
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:06,560
and well look, I'm just guessing that it goes
for Death, too when he's working in our world.

963
01:04:07,065 --> 01:04:08,082
Newton says,

964
01:04:08,106 --> 01:04:09,333
that every action,

965
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:11,138
has an equal and opposite reaction.

966
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:13,204
So, that means that...

967
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:15,131
if Death...

968
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,382
has taken action,

969
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:18,041
so can we.

970
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:19,177
And that,

971
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,512
that action we take might have
an opposite reaction,

972
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:22,871
that thwarts Death's intent.

973
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:24,643
You're being a fucker, but go on.

974
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:25,349
Ok.

975
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:27,121
Ok.

976
01:04:27,585 --> 01:04:28,394
What if,

977
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:29,707
for example...

978
01:04:31,194 --> 01:04:32,440
the last in line,

979
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:35,495
were to make the utilitarian choice...

980
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,267
Kill themselves.

981
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:44,250
That's pretty much gonna ruin
any plan Death's put in motion.

982
01:04:44,555 --> 01:04:45,676
And even better...

983
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:47,330
hey, it's gonna save...

984
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:49,052
five skipped lives.

985
01:04:56,086 --> 01:04:57,150
Any takers?

986
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,256
No, I didn't think so.

987
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:13,409
There! Those!

988
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:53,178
No!

989
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:13,450
I didn't say anything.

990
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,692
I mean, I think they were trying
to scare us into saying something

991
01:06:15,727 --> 01:06:17,349
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

992
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:18,836
What'd you tell them?

993
01:06:18,876 --> 01:06:19,672
Everything.

994
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:21,924
I didn't do anything.
I...

995
01:06:22,096 --> 01:06:23,451
I told them about
the pictures in the camera

996
01:06:23,476 --> 01:06:24,737
and Flight 180 and Frankie and Lewis

997
01:06:24,762 --> 01:06:26,496
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

998
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:28,129
Did they believe you?

999
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:29,307
Yeah, right.

1000
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:32,042
Would you believe me?
No they looked at me like I was crazy.

1001
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:34,635
10 hours they had us in there.

1002
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:36,682
For all we know,

1003
01:06:36,707 --> 01:06:38,572
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

1004
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:39,915
And we're next.

1005
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:41,355
Now.

1006
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:46,324
Ian almost died first,

1007
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:48,329
but we intervened.

1008
01:06:48,893 --> 01:06:50,077
So it skipped lan.

1009
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:51,849
That's how we regain control.

1010
01:06:52,297 --> 01:06:55,060
If someone intercedes the life that
was supposed to be next is skipped.

1011
01:06:55,753 --> 01:06:56,761
Alright, wait, wait, wait. So...

1012
01:06:56,907 --> 01:06:58,840
going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

1013
01:07:00,772 --> 01:07:01,714
I'm next,

1014
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:03,865
and then you.

1015
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:06,318
We can beat this.

1016
01:07:07,604 --> 01:07:09,271
We're so close.
We can't give up.

1017
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:12,308
Alright, my dad's here.

1018
01:07:12,843 --> 01:07:14,091
He's gonna give me a ride back.

1019
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:15,811
But are you sure we shouldn't,

1020
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:17,151
stick together?

1021
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:19,320
It's just for a couple of hours.

1022
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:20,941
Alright? A couple of hours. Go back,

1023
01:07:21,144 --> 01:07:23,233
look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues,

1024
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:24,945
and I'll ask everybody
I see if they know,

1025
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,486
if anyone else got off the ride.

1026
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:28,506
Ok?

1027
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:33,656
Was there something
I should know about going?

1028
01:07:35,812 --> 01:07:37,062
No, it's just...

1029
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:39,713
I'll just be freaking out every second...

1030
01:07:40,544 --> 01:07:41,846
hoping you're ok.

1031
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:43,886
Why?

1032
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:47,213
I mean, we don't even like each other.

1033
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:52,135
Come here.

1034
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,056
Ok?

1035
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:00,583
Alright, I got my cell.

1036
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,600
Hey, Wen?

1037
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,801
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing

1038
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:25,464
and I could really use
my good-luck...

1039
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:27,006
bracelet.

1040
01:09:29,218 --> 01:09:31,498
<i>Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.</i>

1041
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:34,144
Call me on my cell right away.

1042
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,696
<i>Hello?</i>

1043
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:43,031
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

1044
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:44,001
What, your sister?

1045
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:44,763
No.

1046
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:46,266
No, she would've said
something by now.

1047
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:47,861
The person sitting behind lan and Erin

1048
01:09:47,905 --> 01:09:49,619
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet

1049
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,778
our grandmother gave her.

1050
01:09:51,341 --> 01:09:53,677
Amber or Perry were probably
with her so...

1051
01:09:54,134 --> 01:09:55,106
they're next.

1052
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:57,481
<i>I gotta find Julie.
She went to the tricentennial thing.</i>

1053
01:09:57,681 --> 01:09:59,672
Well, I... I'm here now, working security.

1054
01:09:59,716 --> 01:10:00,899
<i>I'll start looking for her.</i>

1055
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:02,999
I'm on my way.
<i>Wen, wait.</i>

1056
01:10:03,413 --> 01:10:04,659
Look after them, we're next.

1057
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:08,259
So in case something happens to them
before we meet up...

1058
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:10,639
remember that time we talked about?

1059
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:12,201
When we look at our pictures?

1060
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:14,567
It's now.

1061
01:10:23,907 --> 01:10:24,667
Great.

1062
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,126
Mine has no clue, it's just...

1063
01:10:26,925 --> 01:10:28,700
me standing in front of
a blank background with,

1064
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,439
Jason at the amusement park.

1065
01:10:31,578 --> 01:10:32,132
Wait.

1066
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:33,850
McKinley.

1067
01:10:34,338 --> 01:10:35,010
<i>Ian?</i>

1068
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,617
<i>Well, is he in the picture?</i>

1069
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:38,806
No but it,

1070
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:40,837
feels like a clue.

1071
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,224
And yours is the picture that...

1072
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:46,689
I took when I flashed
the camera in your face it's all...

1073
01:10:46,946 --> 01:10:49,496
out of focus and overexposed, like...

1074
01:10:55,937 --> 01:10:57,632
Like a firework went off in my face?

1075
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:57,549
The British are coming!

1076
01:11:58,101 --> 01:11:59,693
Get them while they're hot!

1077
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:06,569
Take it to those Redcoats!

1078
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,589
Column, advance!

1079
01:12:20,957 --> 01:12:22,603
The kite is aloft.

1080
01:12:24,443 --> 01:12:25,079
Now,

1081
01:12:25,103 --> 01:12:26,963
let us hope for some lightning.

1082
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:29,254
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1083
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:45,040
This is awesome, dude!

1084
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:49,833
Come on!

1085
01:12:49,858 --> 01:12:51,697
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

1086
01:12:51,722 --> 01:12:52,595
Hurry, dude.

1087
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:54,498
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

1088
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,611
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1089
01:12:57,646 --> 01:12:59,472
<i>to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial</i>

1090
01:12:59,497 --> 01:13:02,366
<i>the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.</i>

1091
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:09,295
Oh, my God. Julie.

1092
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:10,306
What?
Look.

1093
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,657
There's Kahlil.

1094
01:13:12,275 --> 01:13:13,084
Should we?

1095
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,718
Hey guys. I'm sorry
but you can't be here, ok?

1096
01:13:15,743 --> 01:13:16,964
The viewing site is over there.

1097
01:13:16,988 --> 01:13:18,063
You too sir. Come on.

1098
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,779
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

1099
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:21,170
I don't fucking believe them.

1100
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:22,956
Ok, we gotta clear out.

1101
01:13:30,648 --> 01:13:31,642
Excuse me.

1102
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,740
Ladies.
Boys.

1103
01:13:58,861 --> 01:13:59,850
What's going on?

1104
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:01,930
Hey, Julie.

1105
01:14:03,297 --> 01:14:04,386
You three need to come with me.

1106
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,324
What did we do?

1107
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,957
Look, it's for
your own safety Julie, alright?

1108
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:08,828
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, ok?

1109
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:09,750
Let go of me!

1110
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:11,792
Julie.

1111
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:12,381
Hey.

1112
01:14:13,656 --> 01:14:14,435
Julie!

1113
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:45,927
Sweet.

1114
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,092
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

1115
01:15:00,923 --> 01:15:01,816
Julie!

1116
01:15:12,128 --> 01:15:13,686
Oh, shit!
Dude, we gotta bail!

1117
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,030
Hey!

1118
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:34,560
Julie!

1119
01:15:35,629 --> 01:15:36,513
No, wait, wait.

1120
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:39,021
You're in danger, ok?
I'm trying to explain something.

1121
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:41,785
Let me explain this to you.

1122
01:15:45,695 --> 01:15:47,128
Julie, look out!

1123
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,443
Julie!

1124
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:01,997
Cut him off!

1125
01:16:27,037 --> 01:16:28,090
Ok, ok.

1126
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,297
Stay back! He's dangerous!

1127
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:36,486
I got him.

1128
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:38,827
Just let me go.
No, Julie.

1129
01:16:38,949 --> 01:16:40,399
You have to tell me, you have to listen.

1130
01:16:40,459 --> 01:16:42,447
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1131
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:43,658
Oh, my God, Julie are you alright?

1132
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:47,480
Listen to me!
You have to tell me

1133
01:16:47,505 --> 01:16:49,255
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1134
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:50,745
Who? She's next!

1135
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:11,706
Kevin.

1136
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:24,920
Fire!

1137
01:17:25,953 --> 01:17:26,646
Kevin.

1138
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:31,024
You saved my life.

1139
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:37,692
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1140
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:39,732
Shut up, McKinley!
No!

1141
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:41,480
We have to get out of here now.

1142
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:42,385
What's the deal?

1143
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,616
Ian McKinley.
He causes my death.

1144
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:47,521
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

1145
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:49,336
He's the clue.
What?

1146
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:51,176
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

1147
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,175
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

1148
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:56,827
Hey, I'm just...

1149
01:17:56,851 --> 01:17:59,402
celebrating our town's tricentennial.

1150
01:18:02,805 --> 01:18:03,760
You followed me!

1151
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:05,533
You are paranoid.

1152
01:18:05,705 --> 01:18:07,138
But hey, I saw what happened.

1153
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:10,225
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1154
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:12,193
Man, I would be paranoid too.

1155
01:18:12,452 --> 01:18:13,705
You didn't even believe me!

1156
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,173
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

1157
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:18,867
Then you have to stay away from me!

1158
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:19,891
Have to?

1159
01:18:20,878 --> 01:18:21,919
That's extreme.

1160
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:27,904
Oh, no way.

1161
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:32,031
Do I cause your death?

1162
01:18:34,096 --> 01:18:35,716
Just like you caused Erin's?

1163
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:38,269
Wha, wha, wha, what?

1164
01:18:38,462 --> 01:18:39,536
What? You have a vision?

1165
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:41,062
Was I in it?

1166
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:43,504
Was I in a picture?

1167
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:48,321
Just tell me how to start it off!

1168
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:49,886
Let's get this over with!

1169
01:18:51,066 --> 01:18:53,677
You'll save me if you just stay away!

1170
01:18:53,716 --> 01:18:55,013
Then it'll all be over!

1171
01:18:55,217 --> 01:18:56,470
What do I care?

1172
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:57,851
It skipped me.

1173
01:18:58,054 --> 01:18:59,851
For me, it is over.

1174
01:18:59,889 --> 01:19:01,162
I'm not dying!

1175
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:02,742
I'm not dying!

1176
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,370
You see?

1177
01:19:17,107 --> 01:19:18,369
I'm not gonna die!

1178
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:19,826
It's you, Wendy!

1179
01:19:20,003 --> 01:19:20,859
You're dead!

1180

1190
01:20:16,297 --> 01:20:19,061
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

1191
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,543
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

1192
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:22,865
If you don't have turkey

Let's just walk.

1212
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:56,635
It's freezing out.

Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1214
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,347
I could use some air.

1215
01:22:03,848 --> 01:22:04,742
Yeah.

1216
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:06,945
Yeah!

1217
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,766
Yeah, man!
Alright, man. See ya.

1218
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,632
Let's go, Bruins!

1219
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:10,883
Bruins, yeah!

1220
01:22:26,559 --> 01:22:28,083
Hey man, peace out!

1221
01:22:28,128 --> 01:22:29,272
Come on.
Excuse me.

1222
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:31,445
Watch out!
Hey, Bruins!

1223
01:22:32,132 --> 01:22:33,942
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

1224
01:22:34,608 --> 01:22:35,504
This is it!

1225
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:37,232
Yo, coming through.

1226
01:22:37,762 --> 01:22:38,748
Excuse me.

1227
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,322
Hey? Oh, my God.

1228
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:45,031
I can't believe this.

1229
01:22:45,448 --> 01:22:46,216
Here.

1230
01:22:49,449 --> 01:22:50,245
Come on.

1231
01:22:50,642 --> 01:22:51,955
Let's go. Let's go.

1232
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,202
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

1233
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:57,589
Well Dad's car just like
dies out of nowhere...

1234
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,421
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday

1235
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:00,824
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours

1236
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,386
I lucked out and caught an early train.

1237
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:04,592
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

1238
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:05,900
No, no, it's just...

1239
01:23:07,053 --> 01:23:08,263
I think I had a sense...

1240
01:23:09,246 --> 01:23:10,564
that you were coming now.

1241
01:23:14,474 --> 01:23:15,598
I was just...

1242
01:23:17,371 --> 01:23:18,732
I was feeling like I did...

1243
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:20,276
that night.

1244
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:23,177
No. No, it's over.

1245
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:26,126
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

1246
01:23:26,345 --> 01:23:29,220
Ian was gonna cause your death
you intervened and it skipped us.

1247
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:36,833
Look,

1248
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:38,664
I'm not worried.

1249
01:23:38,798 --> 01:23:40,128
I ran into Kevin at home.

1250
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:41,398
He's not worried.

1251
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:43,030
And if I were you...

1252
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,435
until something happens
to me and then Kevin,

1253
01:23:45,545 --> 01:23:47,172
you've got nothing to worry about.

1254
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,451
You're right.

1255
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:54,339
Hey, I. I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, ok?

1256
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,124
Yeah.

1257
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:58,978
Hey, guys. This is Julie my...

1258
01:24:10,763 --> 01:24:11,950
What are you doing here?

1259
01:24:12,832 --> 01:24:14,437
Wendy! Julie!

1260
01:24:15,068 --> 01:24:16,330
What are the chances?

1261
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:18,269
How long have you been on this train?

1262
01:24:18,848 --> 01:24:19,849
Since home.

1263
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,603
I was heading up to check out the game.

1264
01:24:22,174 --> 01:24:23,629
I was gonna look you up afterwards.

1265
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,096
You ok?

1266
01:24:28,307 --> 01:24:29,356
Is something wrong?

1267
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:08,093
Julie stay down!

1268
01:25:09,088 --> 01:25:10,641
Julie!

1269
01:25:17,637 --> 01:25:18,563
Kevin!

1270
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:24,030
God!

1271
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:40,004
No!

1272
01:26:41,084 --> 01:26:42,598
I was gonna look you up afterwards but...

1273
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:45,571
You ok?

1274
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:47,764
Is something wrong?

1275
01:26:49,422 --> 01:26:50,471
The train...

1276
01:26:51,764 --> 01:26:52,570
shit.

1277
01:26:53,357 --> 01:26:54,230
Not again.

1278
01:26:54,727 --> 01:26:55,744
We gotta get out!

1279
01:26:56,362 --> 01:26:57,283
It's not working.

1280
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,268
Somebody stop the train!

1281
01:27:02,773 --> 01:27:05,773
