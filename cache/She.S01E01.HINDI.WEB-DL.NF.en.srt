1
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello, sir.

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,040
Please come upstairs.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
Come.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,720
Come, sir.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,320
Welcome, sir.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,000
Please come.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,440
Since your last visit,
new girls have arrived.

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,640
-Should I call them?
-Just present them.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,880
Sure.

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
Is that all?

11
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,480
Not even the new ones?

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Why the hell are you confusing me?

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,320
New, old... my foot.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Thanks.

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,600
I have two more, part time,
only for special clients.

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Part time?

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,960
They don't work here. They are classy.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,480
During the day,
they work or attend college.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
To earn extra money,
they come here sometimes.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
Why didn't you say that before?

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
How special does the client have to be?

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,160
-What are you waiting for? Go get them.
-Okay.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Sir.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,440
And you... come here.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,320
I won't go with him.

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,200
You won't?

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
What do you mean?

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Who's asking you?

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,760
I'll decide whom you will go with.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,680
What are you staring at, you slut?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,520
I'll pull your eyes out.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,560
Rascal, why don't you say something?

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,560
Sir, this is her part time job.

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,400
She has the choice of saying no.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
That's not my problem.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,280
Why does she have a choice?

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,880
She's so unattractive to look at

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
and behaves like a princess.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
Hey, dream girl.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,920
You're in the market, right?

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
You get paid to have sex.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Just go. Why are you so stubborn?

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,560
I get paid to have sex...

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
but you have to pay for it.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
You slut. Enough of your tantrums.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,680
I'll make you walk naked
in the city, got that?

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
-Kashif.
-Sir...

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
There's a scorpion inside you.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,880
In between your thighs.

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Its venom is flowing through your words.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,720
Man, I'll have to slaughter this scorpion.

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
This scorpion's venom is fatal.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,480
You may lose your life.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
You bloody slut...

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,320
Hey, back off. We're talking here.

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Let me talk to her.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
Now, tell me...

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,880
are the rest of your organs
as sharp as your tongue?

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,880
I start off with my tongue.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I like it,
other organs come in action too.

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,320
-You're testing me?
-Do you have stamina?

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Is that so?

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,920
All right then,

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll show you what I've got.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
I will go with him.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
Thank you very much.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,760
Hope you won't turn out to be a soft toy.

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
And you, better don't cry...

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,640
asking for forgiveness,
to show some mercy on you.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
Because I don't forgive.

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
Come on then.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Sweetheart, did you forget the way?

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,040
Today, that small room,
the five by five bed

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,640
won't be enough for me.

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,120
And I'm not in the mood
for the stench of old condoms either.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,120
-Then what are you in the mood for?
-Sir.

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
You've started making excuses already?

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
What did I tell you?

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,080
I won't show any mercy on you tonight.

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
That's why I'm taking you
to my personal room.

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,800
Personal?

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Are you scared?

84
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,640
Yes, a lot. I'm freaking scared.

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,080
But not for me, for you.

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,960
Because even I don't know what
I'm going to do with your body tonight.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Believe me.

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Save your energy.

89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
And don't worry...

90
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,440
I won't charge you extra
for the personal room.

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm the one who's going to take extra.

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
Well, then I'll pay you today.

93
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay.

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,720
Remember, first they will enter the room.

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Only then will our squad seize him.

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,200
-Okay, sir.
-Yes, sir.

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,480
If you're a part time slut,
then what do you do during the day?

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,880
Finding a job is a job too.

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,120
Tonight, if you turn out to be good...

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,960
and if you're still alive...

101
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,080
then I'll keep you with me. Full time.

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,120
What the fuck!

103
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,600
What's this?

104
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
We did not agree on this.

105
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Hey, are you scared now?

106
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,920
We don't go out like that.

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,440
This isn't right.

108
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,880
Since my childhood
I can't do what is right.

109
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,360
That's my problem.

110
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
How else do I explain?

111
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
I won't go.

112
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,200
Sweetheart, hear me out.

113
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,720
My room doesn't smell of used condoms.

114
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,080
Just the fragrance of roses.

115
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,920
It's fully scented.

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
Fuck!

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
Did he say where he is taking her?

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,160
Sir, there's a disturbance in the audio.
We can't hear them.

119
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Fuck!

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,440
<i>Sir, the target's name is Sasya.</i>

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
He's a big player in narcotics.

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
We've been after him for two years now.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,520
But the problem is, three different
individuals are disguised as Sasya.

124
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
So, it's difficult to catch him.

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Suspect 1, 2 and 3.

126
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,560
Amongst them, the one we doubt
the most is presently in Mumbai.

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,880
This one. But he
has four different identities as well.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,280
Badri, Rana, Yasir and Sasya.

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Our task is to find out

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
whether he is the real Sasya.

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
Without him knowing
that we are looking for Sasya.

132
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,600
That's the reason,
we're doing this undercover operation.

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Because if the cops catch the fake Sasya,

134
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
the real Sasya will be alerted.

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
And if he is the real one...

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
then we have to catch him.

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
-Where is the attack squad?
-Near the room.

138
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
-What's the target's location?
-Opposite street.

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,240
-Why isn't she getting out?
-Khan, where is the car?

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,880
-A few seconds, sir.
-She should've done something.

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,840
-Would you have?
-Sir...

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
She's not carrying a gun
and they are three.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Sir, the target's only weakness is...

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
prostitutes.

145
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,680
He goes to brothels.

146
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
You will have to go disguised
as a prostitute in a brothel.

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,880
An agent will then
introduce you to the target.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,320
Bhumi, you will get proper training
and briefing for this operation.

149
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,320
And you have to confirm
whether he is the real Sasya or not.

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Is your scorpion still sleeping?

151
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
It's still not awake.

152
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,800
If he is the real Sasya,
we have to catch him cleanly.

153
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,080
Else, there could be a lot of violence.

154
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,000
Clear?

155
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes, it's waking up now.

156
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
Give me your phone.

157
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
Give it.

158
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,880
Why?

159
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
Because I want to turn it off.

160
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Ask me why again.

161
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,520
I won't answer
all your questions, sweetheart.

162
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,800
Come on, give it.

163
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,480
-Sir, we can't see her location.
-What?

164
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,240
-They must have switched off her phone.
-Fuck!

165
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
Fuck!

166
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,880
You keep saying anything.

167
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,680
-Don't you have any work?
-Yes, you!

168
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
Let's go upstairs.

169
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Bhumi.

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,920
Mom, it's time for my shift.

171
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,960
-I'm restless since morning.
-What happened?

172
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm out of breath.

173
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
Did you have your medicines?

174
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,520
I did, last night.

175
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,240
You're buying less medicines
to save money, right?

176
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
What's the use of having
the same medicines every day?

177
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Mom...

178
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
This is for your blood pressure.

179
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
This is calcium, for your bones.

180
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Take these two tablets with breakfast.

181
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
Did you prepare breakfast?

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm starving.

183
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,640
-Mom, I'm getting late.
-But what's the hurry?

184
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,840
You have an awesome collection.

185
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
-These shades look great.
-Did you like them?

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Yes. Do I look sexy?

187
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,080
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

188
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,880
Hey, get one for me too.

189
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,360
-You want one?
-Yeah.

190
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
-Which color?
-Green.

191
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,040
-Green would look amazing on you.
-Is it?

192
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,520
-Buy me one?
-Absolutely...

193
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
Hey, Rupa.

194
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
-Go check on Mom.
-I'll go in ten minutes.

195
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
-Where did you buy it from?
-She's unwell.

196
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,160
She's always unwell.

197
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,760
She only pretends, and you know that.

198
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
So how much did it cost you?

199
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
-Will you come...
-Soon.

200
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
-Bye. Really?
-Green will suit you.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,080
-Did you get the full salary last month?
-No.

202
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,440
You'd taken two days' leave?

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,040
-My village...
-Here she comes. Late again.

204
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
Mom is not keeping well.

205
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,280
Make a new excuse at least.

206
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,520
Mhatre, she is a woman,
she must have errands.

207
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,640
Then why did she choose to be a cop?

208
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
Aren't we men enough?

209
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,600
These days, there's no difference
between a man and a woman.

210
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,840
What? Is there no difference?

211
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,760
There is a difference.

212
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,080
Their bodies.

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,640
And the body of a woman
does not suit the job.

214
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,200
They have to take care
of so many things while on duty.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,440
These asshole criminals will pounce there.

216
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,520
And we have got no shit to protect.

217
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,240
In front of a lady don't talk...

218
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,520
There'll be trouble if she complains.

219
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,880
Come on... Bhumi isn't a lady.

220
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
-Am I right, Bhumi?
-Bhumi, you say.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,760
Is a police job suitable for women?

222
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
I get my salary.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,920
So it's good for me.

224
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
REAY ROAD POLICE STATION

225
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,320
Did you tell sir?

226
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,960
-What?
-Did you complain about me?

227
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,720
Whatever I spoke earlier today
at the barricade.

228
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
No.

229
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
-Sir.
-Sir. You sent for us?

230
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,640
-Both of you, come along.
-Where, sir?

231
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
Sir...

232
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Sir!

233
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,800
-Take them.
-Come along.

234
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
It's okay.

235
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
{\an8}MUMBAI POLICE

236
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,280
Be seated.

237
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,640
Sir, I've asked both of them to wait.
Please come.

238
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
-Sit.
-Sir, it's them.

239
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,600
-Thank you.
-Sir.

240
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Sir, I...

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Is your name Mhatre?

242
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
Yes, sir.

243
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay, come inside.

244
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
-What's your full name?
-Bhumika Pardeshi.

245
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
How many years of duty?

246
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
Seven years.

247
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,360
First posting was at Reay Road itself?

248
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Sir. Hirve?

249
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,320
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
-Mathur?
-Sir.

251
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,600
Okay.

252
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
-Okay, Fernandez.
-Thank you, sir.

253
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,160
Come, Bhumi.

254
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,160
Take a seat.

255
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,240
I'm in the anti-narcotics cell,
in the crime branch.

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
My name is Jason Fernandez.

257
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,240
There are certain secret operations
that are carried out by cops.

258
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
These are under-cover operations.

259
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,160
In one such operation, you have to work
disguised as a prostitute.

260
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,000
So, you haven't received any
complaint. Sorry...

261
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
Do you know who is a prostitute?

262
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
What?

263
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm aware of it, sir.

264
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,480
It's quite a sensitive operation.

265
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
You must not speak about it in public.

266
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,960
Only selected cops would know about it.

267
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,040
In fact, nobody at your police station
would have a clue about it.

268
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Except for him.

269
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,920
So... will you do it?

270
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
How will I do it, sir?

271
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
There's nothing much that you need to do.

272
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Let me explain it to you.

273
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
You just have to dress up,
we'll get the make-up done.

274
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,400
We'll take you to a place.

275
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,040
Whatever you have to do
will also be organized.

276
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
Only if you're ready...

277
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
I'll handle everything.

278
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,120
So?

279
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,520
It's a black Scorpio.

280
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,080
You have the details of the number plate.
Yeah. Circulate the information now.

281
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,560
-Did you see the car?
-Not yet, sir.

282
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,080
Keep driving.

283
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,880
Zubin, please tell me
we have her location now.

284
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,800
No, sir. Still can't track her.

285
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,600
Are we even on the same road?
Or a different one, Khan?

286
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,880
Sir, I'm not sure of it right now.

287
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,120
Fuck it. Stop the car.

288
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,240
Stop, we need to evaluate this.

289
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
They won't be too far.

290
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,520
They should be
within a radius of two kilometers.

291
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes, sir.

292
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,920
Yes, but which way?

293
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Did you inform the nearby traffic units?

294
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,720
Yes, sir. They have the details.

295
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Ma'am, come out of the car.

296
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,640
It's a bit old, but does the job well.

297
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Come, don't be scared.

298
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
Are you done?

299
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,960
I have booked all the rooms on this floor.

300
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,520
Don't tire yourself unnecessarily.
We have a lot of work to do together.

301
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,320
This is not fair. This wasn't decided.

302
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,120
More than you,
I have to save myself. Let's go.

303
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,680
You cannot force me.

304
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,360
Force?

305
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,800
There's no question of force
between you and me, sweetheart.

306
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,160
The only thing to decide
is whether you're paying me or I am.

307
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
That's it.

308
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,560
Don't be scared already.

309
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,080
Today, I will give you
only one kind of pain.

310
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,120
Come, don't throw these tantrums.

311
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
Come on, now.
Don't make your lover crave anymore.

312
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,120
What's this nonsense?
It's stuck, unzip it.

313
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
You take off your clothes too.

314
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm shy, you don't know me.

315
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,880
Fuck it. Why so much hard work? Come on.

316
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,400
What little man, you want to do everything
at the same time?

317
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,600
We'll go slow.
First you go, then I will. Right?

318
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,560
I have to go pee.

319
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,840
Till then, you get your scorpion out.

320
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,640
Take off all your clothes,
bra and panty. Be naked, like that.

321
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,560
Head down, back in front.
The moment I'm back, I'll get inside.

322
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,480
<i>This is a dog whistle.</i>

323
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,240
You will blow this and alert us.
It will be in your purse at all times.

324
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,560
It's a high frequency whistle.
Human ear can't hear this.

325
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,120
But we have detectors.

326
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
As soon as we hear it, we will break in.

327
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,400
-As soon as we get an update, we will...
-We have her location.

328
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
-She must have switched on her phone.
-Sir.

329
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
Let's go. Get in the cars, guys.

330
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,880
<i>Your job is to confirm his identity.</i>

331
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
And then, we'll arrest him.

332
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,240
-How far are we?
-Fifteen minutes, sir.

333
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,560
It will be too late.

334
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,120
<i>Why hasn't she left?</i>

335
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,280
<i>She is dumb?</i>

336
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,480
Fernandez, you've made a huge mistake.

337
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,080
You made the wrong choice.
She isn't the right girl.

338
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,520
She'll get herself killed
and we'll be responsible.

339
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,440
-We trained her, sir.
<i>-For two days. Are two days enough?</i>

340
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,160
And you threw her
in front of a hardcore criminal.

341
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,880
A simple constable
with no experience in operations.

342
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,600
Bitch. Will you make me
do all the hard work?

343
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
It's waking up.

344
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,520
Your scorpion is waking up now.

345
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,200
Will you lay like a corpse
or do something?

346
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,920
You're definitely not a prostitute. Right?

347
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,760
You made me toil for three months!

348
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
But you're still cold!

349
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,680
There's not even a little fire inside you!

350
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
You will turn me cold as well!

351
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Whoever you are, your scorpion is real.

352
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,080
I'll listen to your story later.

353
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,520
First, I have to kill this scorpion.

354
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
If I don't kill it right now,

355
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,440
I don't know how many men
it will sting in the future.

356
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,840
What's your secret, sweetheart?

357
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,160
Don't you understand,
we need to finish what we started?

358
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,160
Come on, now.

359
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,840
You have a lot of fight in you. Huh?

360
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,240
You're a man.

361
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,000
You are not a woman.

362
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,880
Your family cheated me.

363
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,800
They got me married to a man.
Motherfuckers.
