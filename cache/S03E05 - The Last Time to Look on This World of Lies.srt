1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,760
<i>The most powerful
are not above the law.</i>

2
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,513
<i>Homelander has provided
evidence of crimes</i>

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,056
<i>committed by Stan Edgar.</i>

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,659
Vicky, I'm glad you chose
your own kind.

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,993
<i>If we need
to fight him,</i>

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,602
- will you help me?
- Okay, I'm in.

7
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,706
<i>A-Train told me
about your little plots.</i>

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,940
Alex! Oh, my God.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,918
- What's B.C.L. Red?
- The thing that killed Soldier Boy.

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:25,943
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,653
You must be Nina.

12
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,155
<i>I'm after a particular weapon.</i>

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,407
<i>We just got to do
a little job for her.</i>

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,825
I want to try something.

15
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,177
<i>It's not power.
It's punishment.</i>

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,369
Evening, cunts.

17
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,875
Why did you do this
to yourself on purpose?

18
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,668
You're better than this, kid.

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,878
Soldier Boy.

20
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,632
Ain't no team for me to hold
together no more, Butcher.

21
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,194
- Hold her head up, Frenchie.
<i>- Mon coeur!</i>

22
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,015
<i>Are you recording?</i>

23
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,099
<i>Yes.</i>

24
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,144
<i>As you know,
the subject's skin has</i>

25
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,896
<i>demonstrated
remarkable durability.</i>

26
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,648
<i>Which includes internal tissue.</i>

27
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,004
How is she?

28
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,383
Stable, for now.

29
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:39,683
<i>Please note that, due to
the procedure dated January 24,</i>

30
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,853
<i>the subject still registers
high radiation levels.</i>

31
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,732
How the fuck's
that cunt still breathing?

32
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,275
Twenty sieverts of radiation.

33
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,985
Sulfuric acid cocktails.

34
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,196
More or less shoved Chernobyl
right up his arse.

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,698
<i>We will now determine
whether his cornea</i>

36
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,492
<i>shares a similar strength.</i>

37
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,453
I'll wager that's how he got
them nasty new powers.

38
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,567
Listen, mate,
we can't hang about here

39
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,801
looking for him, right?

40
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,135
He's Ivan's problem now.

41
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,180
We got to get Kimiko home
to a proper doctor.

42
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,474
You don't give a shit
about Kimiko.

43
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,519
Or anyone else.

44
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,687
Oh, come off it, mate.

45
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,397
Look, I took a fucking drug.

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,316
And in case you forgot,
I just saved your life.

47
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,447
You killed Gunpowder,
didn't you?

48
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,283
Did you use
your little laser eyes?

49
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,451
You're too fucking right, I did.

50
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,995
And it felt good.

51
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,497
For once, I leveled
the fucking playing field.

52
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,457
Butcher,

53
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,419
the whole point of what we do,

54
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,506
the whole goddamn point,

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,675
is that no one should have
that kind of power.

56
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,012
Well, ain't that just fucking
fairies and dancing dildos, eh?

57
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,139
I happen to live
right down here, mate,

58
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,182
on planet Earth.

59
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,315
Oh, fuck.

60
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,376
Looks like Kermit the Frog
had a right wank in your mouth.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,152
No, I'm good, okay?

62
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,865
So I see.

63
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,705
What?

64
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,959
Nothing.

65
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,592
<i>I know
these are difficult times,</i>

66
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,930
but with the greatest humility,
I accept your nomination as CEO

67
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,599
of Vought International.

68
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,953
You know, my mother
used to say, before she

69
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,788
died of cancer when I was 17...

70
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,941
Okay, Ashley, that's enough.
Let's not bring the room down.

71
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,233
Apologies, sir. Of course.

72
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,194
Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

73
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,863
Thank you so much
for coming up to 99,

74
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,699
the mountain to Muhammad,
as it were.

75
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,995
Okay.

76
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,456
Seeing as it's, uh,
my very first board meeting,

77
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,417
I thought perhaps we'd start by,
uh, going around the room

78
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,086
and giving you all a chance

79
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,129
- to introduce yourselves.
- Bill Marsh.

80
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,715
And I, for one, would like
to thank you, Homelander,

81
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,134
for giving me the opportunity
to serve this board

82
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,262
at such a pivotal moment
in, uh, Vought's history.

83
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,264
Pat Willis, sir.

84
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,726
You've rid us of Stan Edgar
and restored honesty, integrity

85
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,062
and innovation
to this corporation.

86
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,272
One question.
With the changes around here,

87
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,733
our EBITDA margins
will drop a tiny bit.

88
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,736
How do you want to handle that
on the earnings call?

89
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,660
What's your name?

90
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,370
Maureen.

91
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,915
Is there something you want
to get off your chest, Maureen?

92
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,667
Sorry, sir? Wh...

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,003
Do you think
you know better than me?

94
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,131
I don't know.
Maybe you think you should be

95
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,966
sitting in my chair and...

96
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,427
I should be sitting
all the way down there in yours.

97
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,595
No, God, no, sir.

98
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,889
I-I'm sorry. I-I was just...

99
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,307
It was stupid of me.

100
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,686
I'm so stupid,
and you're so great.

101
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,272
And... uh...

102
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,774
Maureen, you're embarrassing
yourself. You should go.

103
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,447
So who's next?

104
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,200
We look forward
to working hand in glove

105
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,578
under your tremendous

106
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,331
and
competent leadership, sir.

107
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,917
It was my honor
to lead Crime Analytics

108
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,086
for the past 13 years,

109
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,673
but all good things
must come to an end,

110
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,301
and the Vought board decided
it was time for a change.

111
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:46,013
So, allow me to introduce you
to the new

112
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,182
head of Crime Analytics:

113
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,183
the Deep.

114
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,395
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,148
Thank you for your service, Bar.

116
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,483
Let's hear it for Bar.

117
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,359
Come on, she did great.

118
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,153
For someone with
no practical experience,

119
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,654
it's amazing.

120
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,574
Look, it's always been
a big dream of mine

121
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,993
to be able to fight crime

122
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,871
both at sea and on land.

123
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,459
I'm here to tell you

124
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,002
that if you work hard enough,

125
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,712
there's nothing
you can't achieve.

126
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,130
Hashtag dream big.

127
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,548
Real big.

128
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,176
Because Vought'll make sure
the right man...

129
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,720
Er... Sorry, Barbara.

130
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,098
Right person, gets the job.

131
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,100
So, to break the ice,
we brought...

132
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,062
- Cupcakes.
- Cupcakes.

133
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,605
- From Sprinkles.
- That's right.

134
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,940
Oh, and one more thing.

135
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,733
Everyone just needs
to sign up for, uh,

136
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,652
performance reviews.

137
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,904
Just a formality,
nothing to worry about.

138
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,947
Mmm.
You thinking of going freelance?

139
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,119
Watch her head. Let's go.

140
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,162
She'll be up
and about in no time.

141
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,556
We'll see you
in the morning, yeah?

142
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,420
Fuck you.

143
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,880
Hey.

144
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,009
You still got me.

145
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>Tragically relapsed
into an opioid addiction,</i>

146
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>just as he was slated
to join The Seven.</i>

147
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,022
<i>Not since Len Bias

149
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,609

- Hey.

150
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,194
Um...

151
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,071
Hey. Come here.

152
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,073
Come here.

153
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,201
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,911
I'm so fucking sorry.

155
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,830
I shouldn't be here.
It's not safe for you.

156
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,666
I don't care. It's okay.

157
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,711
Hughie, Homelander killed Alex.

158
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,715
He fucking murdered him,
and it's all my fault.

159
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,467
Hey. It is not your fault.

160
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,845
Come here, come here, come here.

161
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,055
We got Charleston Chew.

162
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,307
We got Almond Joy.

163
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,516
Bit-O-Honey.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,518
There's White Claws
in the fridge.

165
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:00,397
Some of that gross lavender
bath bomb shit in the tub.

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,108
Look, I know
this doesn't make this

167
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,318
any better, but I just...

168
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,862
Let me take care of you
for a second.

169
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,281
Tell me you found it.

170
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,993
Moscow was a dead end.

171
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,786
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,208
No weapon or gun or anything?

173
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,710
Fuck.

174
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,795
Then what killed Soldier Boy?

175
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,732
Let... You know what?
I'm gonna get you a White Claw.

176
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,801
Uh, Hughie?

177
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,511
Your arm is broken.

178
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,715
Where the hell is your cast?

179
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,516
You're-you're really
gonna want a White Claw.

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,852
Wow. All right.

181
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,312
Gonna have another one.

182
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,649
Um... Just... I'm just trying

183
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,151
to get a bead on what, uh,
part you're most upset about.

184
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,112
Is it the part where, uh,
Soldier Boy's loose in Russia,

185
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,074
or the part where I-I took
some temporary Compound V?

186
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,243
Um...

187
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,954
it could be both parts. Uh...

188
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,197
- All the parts.
- I told you right away, though, right?

189
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,540
That's-that's... No secrets.

190
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,793
That's got to be worth
some points.

191
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,128
You want points
for not lying to me?

192
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,924
I... would like to retract
that statement. Um...

193
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,010
Hughie, you shot up
an untested drug

194
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,012
from Vought.

195
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,722
You could've
gotten yourself killed.

196
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:16,974
We don't have any more.

197
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,684
And even if we did,
I-I wouldn't take it.

198
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,893
It was awful.

199
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,981
Like, uh, the hangover,
all of it, just...

200
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,608
absolutely hated it.

201
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,278
- You loved it.
- I fucking really loved it.

202
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,071
It was awesome.
I mean, you know me.

203
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,407
If a guy in the car next to me
gives me a dirty look,

204
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm like fucking
Dom Torreto taking off,

205
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,178
trying to get away from him
'cause I'm quick

206
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,537
and I'm all about family.

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,998
But in Russia...

208
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,457
I wasn't scared.

209
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,751
I-I... I saved M.M.

210
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,835
Me.

211
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,964
I could, like, teleport.

212
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,841
- Teleport?
- Yeah, I-I just...

213
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,342
I knew how to do it.

214
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,429
I just clenched my butt,
and-and I jumped, and...

215
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,932
No. Hughie, that was
stupid and dangerous.

216
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,103
I can't lose you, too.

217
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,109
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're right.

218
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,194
It's over.

219
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,825
So...

220
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,368
what do we do now?

221
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,787
I don't know.

222
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,623
But whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

223
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,793
You and me
against the world, right?

224
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,798
I love you.

225
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,467
I love you, too.

226
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,259
How the fuck is
Soldier Boy still alive?

227
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,763
Another nutter loose
in the world, thanks to us.

228
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,099
You look like warmed-over shit.

229
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,394
Well... least I'll be sober
in the morning.

230
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,105
You'll still be a Supe.

231
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,358
Well, if Supes
are so fucking vile,

232
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,693
why do you want to be one again?

233
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,992
What are you
gonna do with those?

234
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,130
No, thanks.

235
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,008
I've been sober
four months, asshole.

236
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,136
It's been a year for me.

237
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,359
What about Homelander's son?

238
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,737
No.

239
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,699
Be years before
Ryan can take him on.

240
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,160
What about that plane video?

241
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,745
I mean, I know it wouldn't be
so brilliant for you,

242
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,247
but...

243
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,875
least it'll pull back
the curtain on the cunt.

244
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,378
Would send him over the edge.

245
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,965
He'd end up killing
a million people.

246
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,969
The video was always a bluff.

247
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,639
Not to me it ain't.

248
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,604
I thought I hated the guy.

249
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,282
I done them all.

250
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,618
Coke, E, meth, smack.

251
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,914
Ain't nothing like this.

252
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,586
Used to be months of leg work
to take down a Supe.

253
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,297
Gunpowder...

254
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,090
not even a New York minute.

255
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,886
Must've felt good.

256
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,098
I hated every second.

257
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,102
No.

258
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,981
The V just made me more...

259
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,860
...me.

260
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,242
With great power
comes the absolute certainty

261
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,536
that you'll turn into
a right cunt.

262
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,788
I mean, that's the thing, right?

263
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,039
You're all just people.

264
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,708
All the V does is just

265
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,670
amp up all that shit
that's already inside.

266
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,049
Your lot? Just a bunch
of walking nuclear erections.

267
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,093
You know?
A-And it's not just Homelander.

268
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,345
I mean,
you-you fucking all got to go.

269
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,269
Every fucking last...

270
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,896
...one of you.

271
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,650
Yeah.

272
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,094
What? You still think
you're too good for me?

273

Chocolate limes.

284
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,148
For when she wakes up.

285
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,486
I pray she pulls through.

286
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,743
Ten dead Russian soldiers.

287
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,040
A classified lab destroyed.

288
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,000
Three of my contacts
in the Kremlin

289
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,169
have disappeared already.

290
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,215
You know, Sergei, there is
this absolute natural law.

291
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,050
That law, it says

292
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,886
you do not fuck me, I fuck you.

293
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,848
It was Monsieur Charcutier
who came to you,

294
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,975
made the deal with you.
Take it up with him.

295
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,269
I don't know him. I know you.

296
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,647
You're the one
who introduced us.

297
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,190
You're the one
who pays the debt.

298
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,150
You work for me now.

299
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,236
<i>Absolument pas.</i>

300
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,780
You know, before you
abandoned me for Butcher,

301
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,407
you always wrung your hands.

302
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,283
"Oh, Nina, I cannot kill.

303
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,119
It's like acid to my heart."

304
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,079
Yet you always did.

305
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,924
Pyotr Semenov
and his daughter Katarina.

306
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,385
You do it today.

307
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,594
She's just a child.

308
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,055
That's never stopped you before.

309
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,017
Call me when it's done.

310
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,655
<i>Mon coeur?</i>

311
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,241
<i>Mon coeur?</i> Hey.

312
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,584
<i>Ca va?</i>

313
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,964
How are you feeling?

314
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,149
It was Soldier Boy.

315
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,491
Why are you smiling?

316
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,786
- I didn't heal!
- Hmm.

317
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,914
Hand me something heavy!

318
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:01,998
Something heavy!

319
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,600
It's too heavy!

320
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,728
It must've been Soldier Boy!

321
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,814
My powers are gone!

322
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,323
Can I help you?

323
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,451
Supersonic trusted you,
and you got him killed.

324
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,455
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You fucking coward.

325
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,542
Why are you so desperate
to be with people who hate you?

326
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,049
Congrats from Lindsey Graham.

327
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,553
He's such a gooch-licker.

328
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,638
Anyway, I hope you know
how much Homelander

329
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,056
appreciates your loyalty.

330
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,059
Now more than ever,
he needs people he can trust.

331
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,688
So, to thank you
for being a team player,

332
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,190
Homelander has agreed to a
meeting with you and Blue Hawk.

333
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,900
Okay, great.

334
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,151
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,504
I'll just pop outside
and get him.

336
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,239
What? Like, right now?

337
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,949
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,969
- Thanks for coming on such short notice, Blue Hawk.
- Oh.

339
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,327
A-Train.

340
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,495
Hey.

341
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,372
Big fan.

342
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,249
Cool. Yeah.

343
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,335
- Blue Hawk.
- Yeah.

344
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,539
I wanted to talk to you
about your patrols in Trenton.

345
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,799
Little excessive.

346
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,677
Hmm? Says who?

347
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,096
Well, a lot of Black folks.

348
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,848
No.

349
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,934
No. This has nothing
to do with...

350
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,438
...African Americans.

351
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,607
You and me both trained
with Coach Brink at school.

352
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,984
We were taught
to dominate totally.

353
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,444
Yeah, but

354
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,113
you're mostly just doing it
in-in Black neighborhoods.

355
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,756
And you don't want people to say
that you're being racist, right?

356
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,912
You know, it's actually racist
to call somebody racist.

357
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,706
What is this?

358
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,377
Is this, like, a "cancel" thing?
Am I being canceled?

359
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,592
What can I do
to make this right?

360
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,427
Wouldn't take much.

361
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,554
I don't know.
Make an apology or some shit.

362
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,307
What a great idea.
Thank you for saying that.

363
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,685
I'm sure Homelander would
really, really appreciate that,

364
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,769
Blue Hawk.

365
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,773
Hey, name the time and place.

366
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,944
It is so important
to do the work,

367
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,696
to have the difficult
conversations.

368
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,615
This is so great, you guys.

369
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,140
What the fuck?

370
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,976
Hey, buddy?

371
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,853
You okay, buddy?

372
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,110
<i>I'm not just like
the rest of you.</i>

373
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,071
<i>I'm stronger. I'm smarter.</i>

374
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,906
<i>I'm better.</i>

375
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,241
<i>I am better!</i>

376
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,826
<i>I'm not some</i>

377
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,453
<i>weak-kneed... cry baby...</i>

378
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,788
- Hey, look who it is.
- Todd.

379
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,915
- Hey, baby.
- Daddy!

380
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,168
Ah... hey!

381
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,878
- You ready?
- Yeah.

382
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,464
All right. Go get your backpack.

383
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,947
She can't stop talking
about this Science Center trip.

384
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,053
<i>All my life,
people have tried to control me.</i>

385
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,929
<i>My whole life.</i>

386
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,348
Todd, you, uh...

387
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,767
you got Janine
watching this guy?

388
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,185
I know, I know.

389
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,438
His language gets a bit salty,
but it's good for her.

390
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,192
How is this good for Janine?

391
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,110
Um, because he's America's

392
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,946
greatest hero who saves
thousands of people.

393
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,407
He's standing up to the crooks,

394
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,367
the corporations
and the legacy media.

395
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,691
Hey, you friend me on Facebook,

396
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,180
I'll send you some stuff
that will...

397
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,747
Todd, I don't want
Janine watching

398
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,499
any more of this garbage.

399
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,084
- Do you understand?
- Ready.

400
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,936
Why? Janine loves Homelander.
He's her favorite.

401
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,128
Isn't that right, sweetie?

402
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,522
'Cause
Homelander is a psycho

403
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,465
- piece of shit, that's why.
- Daddy.

404
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,051
You want to pull it back in
front of the kid there, Marvin?

405
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,096
It's not the kid.
She's my daughter.

406
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,640
- Okay.
<i>- We have breaking news this hour.</i>

407
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,893
<i>An explosion just rocked
midtown Manhattan.</i>

408
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,604
<i>Early reports indicate
19 are dead.</i>

409
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,360
<i>The NYPD and Bureau
of Superhuman Affairs...</i>

410
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,579
Baby, I'm sorry,
but Daddy's got to go.

411
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,623
No. Daddy, I want to go
to the Science Center.

412
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,060
What are you doing? She's
been waiting for this all week.

413
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,502
Did I do something wrong?

414
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,925
No, baby.

415
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,593
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,932
<i>The NYPD and
Bureau of Superhuman Affairs</i>

417
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,144
<i>are calling it the work
of an unknown supervillain.</i>

418
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,562
<i>At this time,
we're still waiting</i>

419
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,438
<i>for more information
from authorities...</i>

420
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,066
Homelander?
Did you hear me?

421
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,276
Sorry, what?

422
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,405
I said we need
to handle this. Now.

423
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,991
<i>...confirmed killed,
with dozens more injured.</i>

424
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,910
Uh, yeah, of course we do. Okay.

425
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,621
So, book slots
on all the Sunday shows.

426
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,957
Tell them that, uh,
there's nothing to worry about,

427
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,083
not a thing.

428
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,435
We got everything under control.

429
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,586
- That's smart.
- So smart.

430
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,021
- So we're gonna...
- Jesus, I meant that

431
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,505
we need to stop this guy!

432
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:28,050
Could you watch your
fucking tone, please, darling.

433
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,762
I'm sorry.

434
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,390
I just, I mean...

435
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,684
Don't you think that

436
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,313
maybe the best way
to handle this is to find him?

437
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,065
I never thought of that.
Obviously.

438
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,484
God. O-Okay, so why don't you
go and do that?

439
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,528
Hmm? Run along and save the day.

440
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,280
Meanwhile, the grown-ups,

441
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,240
well, we got to worry
about the share price

442
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,368
and the EBITDA margins, okay?

443
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,540
- Thank you.
- So much.

444
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,752
Hey. It's me.

445
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,837
Tell me this isn't
who I think it is.

446
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,505
Probably exactly
who you think it is.

447
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,216
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

448
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,176
Look, we're coming
up on the site now.

449
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,695
Can your Crime Analytics people
look for him?

450
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,638
I'm on it.
Just be careful, Hughie.

451
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,906
Fucking hell.

452
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,032
Hughie.

453
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,576
Ivy.

454
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,287
Hey, uh...

455
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,830
Morning, morning.

456
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,999
- Is Vicky here?
- She's on her way.

457
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,918
Didn't you break your arm?

458
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,337
Yeah, um...

459
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,130
Yes. It turns out
it's a bad sprain,

460
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,591
- so I-I'm okay. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

461
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:10,820
Oi.

462
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,075
Still think
he's the Reds' problem?

463
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,203
All right. Easy, mate.

464
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,621
Fuck you.

465
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,164
I'll find him myself.

466
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,835
And what you gonna do
when you find him, eh?

467
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,463
He's well out
of your league, son.

468
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,174
You need help.

469
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,176
You need us.

470
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,890
Oh, we can talk about
what a cunt I am another time.

471
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,352
But right now, let's just
focus on the job at hand.

472
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,939
Let me help you
with Soldier Boy.

473
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,817
I owe you that much, and then
you don't got to see me no more.

474
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,246
Knowing you,
you already got a lead?

475
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,499
Course I fucking do.
Look at where we are.

476
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,712
The Legend.

477
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,423
Want to bet Soldier Boy
paid him a visit?

478
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,973
- Do you want the other half?
- No. No.

479
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,768
Not right now, thanks.
You were saying?

480
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,936
To find the guy,
we'd have to comb through

481
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,813
every CCTV camera in the city.

482
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,483
It would take a dozen analysts
working double shifts.

483
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,610
Okay, then let's do it.

484
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,112
Where is everyone?

485
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,073
We are everyone.

486
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,491
Deep fired
most of the department.

487
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,910
What? Why?

488
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,304
They had some tweets
over the years

489
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,746
he said were critical
of Homelander.

490
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,165
Said he only wants
"team players."

491
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,835
Can I have that half?

492
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,087
Thank you.

505
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,752
- He wants to apologize.
- He came with you?

506
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,786
And a camera crew? Come on, man.

507
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,413
Listen, you get
a public apology,

508
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,540
Vought gets some publicity.
It's a win-win.

509
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,959
You just spring this shit on me?

510
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,895
- What's wrong with you?
- Isn't this what you wanted?

511
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,422
For me to use my platform
to help the community, right?

512
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,385
Five minutes.

513
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,138
All right.

514
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,537
Sorry, sorry.

515
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:52,022
It's the metal in my helmet.

516
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,860
All right.

517
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,571
To, uh, the residents
of Trenton,

518
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,090
thank you for giving me
the opportunity

519
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,407
to speak with you today.

520
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,284
As you know,
superheroes often have to make,

521
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,369
like, uh, split-second decisions

522
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,955
when fighting crime,
a-a-and I apologize

523
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,249
if any of mine have been...

524
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,919
perceived as being... racist.

525
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,921
But that is not who I am, okay?

526
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,506
Just ask my friends,

527
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,968
many of whom are, uh, are Black,

528
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,178
like A-Train.

529
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,430
I do not see color.

530
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,183
I only see crime.

531
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,395
And as a sign of my commitment
to you all, I am donating

532
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,899
$10,000 to this
community center. Thank you.

533
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,650
What about what you did
to Raymond Tucker?

534
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,129
Well, he-he-he was a criminal.

535
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,446
He was unarmed.

536
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,590
Would you have done
the same thing

537
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,823
to a white guy in Mill Hill?

538
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,909
I-I go
where the crime is,

539
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,662
and the crime just happens
to be i-in Black neighborhoods.

540
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,223
That-That's not my fault.

541
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,892
All right, all right.
No, that's enough here.

542
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,436
We're done here.
Just say you're sorry,

543
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,728
and we can get out of here.
Yeah.

544
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,337
You know what? Do your research.

545
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,421
Like, Blacks commit

546
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,773
a disproportionate
number of murders.

547
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,591
How about all the Black men
you murdered?

548
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,360
How about you tell me why were
they so fucking aggressive?!

549
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,677
I was acting in self-defense.

550
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,054
You got powers! They don't!

551
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,573
- Black lives matter!
- Fuck you, Blue Hawk!

552
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,891
Walk away, walk away.

553
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,035
Where you going?
Get the fuck out.

554
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,394
- Come on, out!
- All lives matter.

555
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,838
- All lives matter.
- Black lives matter, motherfucker!

556
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,274
Supe lives matter.
Supe lives matter!

557
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,026
Supe lives matter,
you fucking ingrates!

558
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,444
Hey, Blue Hawk!

559
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,363
Shut the fuck up!

560
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,166
Fuck out of here!

561
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,494
- Shit!
- Stupid fucks!

562
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,746
Shut the f...
Get the fuck out of here!

563
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:33,749
Stop!

564
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,877
Oh, my God!

565
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,298
Why?!

566
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,176
Nate?

567
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,720
Nate!

568
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,891
Just leave it.

569
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,393
What?

570
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,563
Leave the goddamn
clams casino at the door.

571
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,982
This ain't Grubhub,
motherfucker. Open up.

572
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,236
Marvin. Hey.

573
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,408
I see you still got this piece
of dog shit stuck to your boot.

574
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,285
Oh, go do one,
you withered old cunt.

575
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,745
This is Hughie.

576
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,998
Hughie, you know who this is?

577
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,835
He doesn't know who I am?
Read a fucking book, kid.

578
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,588
This... this is The Legend.

579
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,007
That's, uh, quite a nickname.

580
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,260
No, it's not a name.
It's a level.

581
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,596
Legend, we need to talk.

582
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,056
- Not him.
- He'll behave.

583
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,391
You got my word.

584
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,103
This is important,
and you owe me.

585
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,241
<i>♪ One step ♪</i>

586
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,535
<i> ♪ One step at a time... ♪</i>

587
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,203
Whoa.

588
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,455
Is that you and Roy Scheider?

589
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,664
That's at the Chateau

590
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,499
after the <i>Marathon Man</i> premiere.

591
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,252
Roy Scheider, Dustin,
Anjelica, Big Chief Apache.

592
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,713
That whole night's
a little cloudy to me.

593
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,465
But if you ask Army Archerd,

594
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,217
I was balls deep
in Golden Geisha,

595
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,013
and Marlon Brando
was apparently balls deep in me.

596
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,264
What?

597
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,516
That's gay now?
Fuck you. Who cares?

598
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,143
What's the difference?

599
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,228
Anyway, after that,
I got Marlon to cut his quote

600
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,689
on that Steel Knight picture,
so I ask you,

601
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,441
who fucked who?

602
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,818
He was here, wasn't he?

603
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,737
Hmm?

604
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,740
Oh, no, I'm-I'm good.
I'm-I'm full. Of cocaine.

605
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,075
All right.

606
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,744
See, now Vought
is all demo points

607
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,162
and audience testing,

608
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,414
thanks to those
backstabbing fucks

609
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,041
Edgar and Stillwell.

610
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,043
And yes, I know she's dead.

611
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,420
- Fuck her anyway.
- So, The Legend was

612
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,214
the VP of Hero Management
over at Vought

613
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,632
before Stillwell came in.

614
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,384
He helps us out
from time to time.

615
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,968
He really doesn't know who I am?

616
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,681
See, when I was in charge,
you go with your gut.

617
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,015
That's when heroes were heroes,

618
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,310
not these stage-managed
silicone dolls.

619
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,771
I've never even seen
Homelander sweat,

620
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,358
let alone butter churn
half the cast of <i>Falcon Crest</i>

621
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,111
at the Beverly Hills Hotel,
which I did.

622
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,237
Two words.

623
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,572
Shannon Tweed.

624
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,991
Legend.

625
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,035
Soldier Boy came to see you.

626
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,621
- I need to know what he said.
- What are you, crazy?

627
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,848
Marvin, he's a fucking doornail.

628
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,207
So who's that coke for?

629
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,418
That's just me.

630
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,752
I'm writing my memoir.

631
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,796
It's gonna be really dynamite.

632
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,047
So I'm, you know,

633
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,608
I'm burning the candle
at both ends. I swear.

634
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,259
I swear on my kids' lives.

635
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,635
You hate your fucking kids.

636
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,095
So would you if you met them.

637
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,347
So, if I ran
the prints on that mirror,

638
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,807
who would I come up with?

639
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,477
- Huh.
- Don't worry.

640
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,313
Soldier Boy's not gonna trace
this back to you. Trust me.

641
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,399
Oh, trust you.

642
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,818
Like I trusted him?

643
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,112
You forget what happened
last time I helped?

644
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,449
- The underage hooker sting on Electroshock?
- Oh. Oh.

645
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,494
You can't trust a man like that.

646
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,621
Everything and everyone
he touches turns to shit.

647
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,415
Well, you can trust me

648
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,476
to bash your fucking brains out
with that leg, mate.

649
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,710
Butcher, please.

650
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,215
Look, I'm the one you trust.

651
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,509
Now, you know what Soldier Boy
did to my family.

652
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,637
And you know
because you okayed the cover-up.

653
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,182
Shit, I... I okayed
a million cover-ups.

654
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,350
And they're all tearing you up.

655
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,145
So just make this one right,
will you?

656
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,110
I thought
I was staring at a ghost,

657
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,862
but it was him.

658
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,865
He had a fucked-up beard, maybe,

659
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,576
- but he hadn't aged a day.
- Wait, so he doesn't get old?

660
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,661
- Like Stormfront?
- We kept that under wraps.

661
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,955
Though it got a little fishy
when he starred

662
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,708
in that <i>Love and War</i> picture
with Phoebe Cates.

663
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,543
He was 63. She was 19.

664
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,962
Oh, fuck. Remember <i>Entrapment?</i>

665
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,590
Connery banged Zeta-Jones.
He was, like, a thousand.

666
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,300
Why was Soldier Boy here?

667
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,761
Came to pick up his super suit.

668
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,346
I held on to it.

669
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,931
You know me. I'm sentimental.

670
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,225
Although I did actually wear
the suit once

671
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,643
for Kelly LeBrock.

672
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,187
By the way, her, too.

673
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,940
You don't know Kelly LeBrock?
Fucking google it.

674
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,650
Big "L." Big "B."

675
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,777
The other letters, small.

676
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,421
So, did he tell you
where he was going next?

677
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,281
Or that he was gonna blow up
a fucking restaurant on 59th?

678
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,617
Who the hell knows
why talent does what they do?

679
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,035
That's why they're talent.

680
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,292
He also came
for his girlfriend's address.

681
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,045
He's headed there.

682
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,964
Crimson Countess?

683
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,259
Why?

684
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,541
I didn't get the feeling
it was gonna be a happy reunion,

685
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,390
but I don't know.

686
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,767
Maybe you can go there
and find out.

687
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,854
But mostly,
get the fuck out of here.

688
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,023
<i>Today's attack</i>

689
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,417
- on 59th Street.
- Yeah.

690
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,402
How great a threat
is America facing?

691
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,570
Oh, no threat whatsoever.

692
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,864
No. Truly, i-it is a stretch

693
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,825
to even call this guy
a supervillain.

694
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,511
The Stormchasers,
Stormfront's supporters,

695
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,078
said on 4chan
that this whole thing

696
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,247
was an attempt by Stan Edgar
to discredit you.

697
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,707
Right. Yeah.

698
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,893
Well, look, I-I don't know
anything about Stormchasers,

699
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,588
but, uh, look, I can understand
why they might think that.

700
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,756
The minute we free Vought
of the corruption

701
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,508
and the lies, and this happens.

702
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:20,220
I mean, the timing
is, uh, very convenient.

703
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,597
Smells like a false flag.

704
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,640
Well, you said it, pal, not me.

705
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,393
<i>And what do you say
to the mayor who wants to, uh,</i>

706
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,437
<i>impose a citywide curfew
until the terrorists</i>

707
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,622
<i>- are captured?
- Oh, please.</i>

708
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,981
<i>America is safe.</i>

709
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,274
<i>Okay? It is safe.</i>

710
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,401
<i>So, everyone, get out there.</i>

711
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,736
<i>Go to your restaurants</i>

712
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,030
<i>and, uh,
go to your movie theaters</i>

713
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,656
<i>and-and live your lives.</i>

714
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,991
<i>Have fun, okay?</i>

715
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,410
You think it really
was Edgar and the mayor?

716
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,203
Maybe Jake Tapper.

717
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,790
Trying to fuck with me?

718
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,459
Make me look ridiculous?

719
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,713
Or maybe

720
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,383
you're just
a paranoid, malignant narcissist

721
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,219
who thinks
everything is about you.

722
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,055
Mm, it's not paranoia

723
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,349
if they're really
out to get you, though.

724
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,811
And you, Maeve.

725
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,649
You're out to get me,
aren't you?

726
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,237
What are you talking about?

727
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,656
William Butcher.

728
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,783
I can smell him all over you.

729
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:26,453
You really will do anything
to hurt me, won't you?

730
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,958
So...

731
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,377
what are you and William
cooking up?

732
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,545
Hmm?

733
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,382
Maybe you two brought
that supervillain to town.

734
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,716
Oh, John.

735
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,052
John, come on.

736
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,388
You're talking crazy.

737
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,867
I'm not cooking anything up with Butcher.

738
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,351
Let's talk about this.

739
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,478
Don't you dare
fucking "John" me.

740
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,439
You're not gonna weasel
your way out of this.

741
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,528
You know the real tragic thing
in all of this?

742
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,865
It's that, more than anyone,
I knew what it was like for you.

743
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,867
Swarmed everywhere we went.

744
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,370
Every little mistake,
front-page news.

745
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:13,333
It is lonely at the top, yes,
but at least we had each other.

746
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,085
We were lonely together.

747
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,255
And I loved you.

748
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,340
In my own way.

749
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,761
But you...

750
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,639
What happened?

751
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:31,101
Was anything about us ever real?

752
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,769
Hmm?

753
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,911
From the start,

754
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,288
I hated you.

755
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,211
But what's more,

756
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,131
I fucking pitied you.

757
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,678
You're completely
and utterly alone.

758
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,847
You're getting old and bitter.

759
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,350
You pity me?

760
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,816
I mean,
that's actually kind of funny,

761
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,027
don't you think?

762
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,865
Hey.

763
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,869
You want to know
something else that's funny?

764
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,917
Frenchie's not answering.

765
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,251
Kimiko's out of commission.

766
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,003
Soldier Boy's
already got a head start.

767
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,838
We gonna need some backup.

768
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,009
And here it is.

769
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:49,221
I thought
you were out.

770
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,598
Nipped into the Duane Reade,
got some more, didn't I?

771
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,187
Look, I know how you feel
about this shite,

772
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,564
but it's Soldier Boy.

773
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,191
So why don't you come down

774
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,693
off your high horse
just this once, eh?

775
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,701
- My dad wouldn't want it.
- Your dad,

776
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,036
who died of a dodgy ticker,

777
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,746
suing Vought
and never getting nowhere?

778
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,374
Yeah. Him.

779
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,834
You know, he also said,

780
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,128
if you don't draw
the line somewhere,

781
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,797
how the hell are you gonna know
where you stand?

782
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,882
They ain't drawing no line.

783
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,843
Which is why we got to.

784
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,263
I'm in. Give me some.

785
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,307
Kid, didn't you just hear
a goddamn word I said?

786
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,271
I mean, who do you guys want?
Do you guys w-want

787
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,979
gawky, weak,
freaking-the-fuck-out Hughie

788
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,564
or do you want
strong, confident,

789
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,857
handling-his-shit Hughie?

790
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,110
With it, I can actually help.

791
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,696
Without it, I'm...

792
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,322
I-I'm probably dead.

793
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,709
Lad can think for himself.

794
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,599
- I am so sorry, Ms. Barrett.
- What the fuck

795
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,893
- did he do to Maeve?
- That's all right, Gregory.

796
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,062
Maeve is at the Global Wellness
Retreat in Malibu.

797
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,523
Asking for help,
it's just not easy.

798
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:27,611
And she is just truly
Brave Maeve, isn't she?

799
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,654
Mm-hmm. I want to speak
to her right now.

800
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,778
Unfortunately, the facility
requires a digital detox

801
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,409
for their patients, but I'm sure
you can leave her a message.

802
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,536
Goddamn it, Ashley!

803
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,080
- We can't let him do this.
- Who are you referring to?

804
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,960
He is out of control.

805
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,087
Yesterday, it was Supersonic.

806
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,422
Today, it's Maeve.

807

Tomorrow, maybe it's me or you.

808

Look, I know you're scared.

809
00:41:55,305 --> 00:42:00,518
I am, too, but this CEO job,
it can't be worth your life.

00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,733
Oh.

You just need to be human.

Please. Where is Maeve?

815
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,580
Is she even alive?

816
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,460
Look, Starlight, sh...

00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,885
I am CEO.

818
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,929
Next time,

00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,133

00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,545
I mean, what else
was I supposed to do?

960
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,065
- You were supposed to call me.
- Yeah, and what if you got hurt

961
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,632
trying to save me, Annie?

962
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,594
I would never forgive myself.
But now you don't have to, okay?

963
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,222
I can handle myself.
I can finally save you for once.

964
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,978
I don't need you
to save me, Hughie.

965
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:07,982
I need you.

966
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,729
What'd you do?

967
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:50,483
I know you're never
gonna forgive me,

968
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,485
but you left me no choice.

969
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,362
Why?

970
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,698
I can't draw no line, M.

971
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,202
Not with what I got to do.

972
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,455
I'm sorry.

973
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,667
You'll be all right
in the morning.

974
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,859
You're that asshole
from the lab.

975
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,236
That's right.

976
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,113
I'm the arsehole
that let you out.

977
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,574
Russian Porta-Loos, eh?

978
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,702
You want the Countess's head
on a spike, don't you?

979
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,872
Well, she's in there,
yours for the taking.

980
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,709
Consider it a gesture
of good faith.

981
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,669
Good faith for what?

982
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:00,219
I was thinking that you and I

983
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,221
could come
to a little arrangement.

984
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:05,516
What you lot call...

985
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,018
a team up.

986
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,191
Ben?

987
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,652
Is that really you?

988
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,910
You look so young.

989
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,578
You don't.

990
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:31,000
I'm so, so sorry.

991
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,085
It wasn't my idea.

992
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,921
God, you got to
believe me. I-I...

993
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,381
How much did
the Russians pay you?

994
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,093
Hmm?

995
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,555
They didn't.

996
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,265
What?

997
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,646
They didn't pay you anything?

998
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,652
I loved you.

999
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,655
All those years...

1000
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,992
...that they burned me

1001
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:08,537
and that they pumped me
full of poison,

1002
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:12,625
I held onto the hope
that you would come.

1003
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,671
That you would save me.

1004
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,968
Because I still loved you.

1005
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,806
I didn't love you.

1006
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,059
I hated you.

1007
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,229
We all did.

1008
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,136
Annie, please, just go.

1009
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,346
Let us handle this.
You can yell at me...

1010
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,061
What happened? Is he hurt?

1011
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,313
Keep an eye on him.

1012
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,566
He's had four or five mgs
of Rohypnol.

1013
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,943
You fucking roofied him?!

1014
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,176
What are you doing?

1015
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:50,973
Annie, listen.

1016
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,850
We wanted a weapon.

1017
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,643
Soldier Boy's our weapon.

1018
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,897
He's how we kill Homelander.
And Neuman maybe.

1019
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,774
If anyone's strong enough,
he is.

1020
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,276
Y-You knew Butcher
was gonna do this?

1021
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,946
M.M. never would've
gone for it, and you...

1022
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,199
- Look, you weren't supposed to be here.
- Oh.

1023
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,951
So...

1024
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,745
no more secrets, huh?

1025
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,957
Hughie...

1026
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,168
you're teaming up
with a murderer.

1027
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,296
This is the only way that I can
save you from Homelander.

1028
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,592
I'm doing this for you.

1029
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,428
Whatever it takes, remember?

1030
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,932
Come with us.

1031
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,561
You and me against the world.

1032
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:38,938
Hughie.

1033
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,867
Please don't go.
