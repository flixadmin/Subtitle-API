1
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,338
- On the heels of the
Cold War, Barry Goldwater,

2
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,501
a business man and a five
term United States senator

3
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,613
from Arizona decided to run

4
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,238
for the election of the presidency-.

5
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,682
He had a substantial impact...

6
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,480
- Are you excited for summer?

7
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,746
- Yeah.

8
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,459
- Are you gonna see your friends?

9
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,518
- No.

10
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,789
- Why not?

11
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,760
- Don't have any.

12
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,593
- So you'll be with your brother?

13
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,688
- Yeah.

14
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,733
- But Milo I think
we've seen each other enough

15
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,306
that we trust each other, right'?

16
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,304
- Yeah.

17
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,433
- You know you can
answer honestly with me?

18
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,603
- Yeah.
- There are no consequences.

19
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,943
You understand you don't get in trouble?

20
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,143
- Yeah.

21
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,420
- Have you been
hurting any animals?

22
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,919
- No.

23
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,983
- Not at all, not even thinking?

24
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,597
- Maybe thinking, but no.

25
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,426
- So you're thinking about that?

26
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,330
Tell me about that, tell
me about the thoughts.

27
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,971
- It's nothing, just thoughts in my head,

28
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,563
but I don't do it, not anymore.

29
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,472
- Where you going?

30
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,748
Come here.
- Fuck him up G.

31
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,988
- Hold him.
- Hit him.

32
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,253
Stop it retard.

33
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
That's nasty.

34
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,227
You got to run bro, that was tucked up.

35
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,063
- That's right you
better run little bitch.

36
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,242
. Hey-

37
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
- Did you buy milk'?

38
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,128
- No.

39
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,788
- We need milk.

40
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,433
- Did you pay the internet bill?

41
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,333
- No.
- I need the internet.

42
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,527
- Then pay it.

43
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,605
Get milk too.

44
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,426
What the fuck are you doing?

45
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,619
- Nothing.

46
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,004
- Do they eat all that?

47
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,838
- Yeah well they scoop
out, they pull out that stomach

48
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,884
and they eat the whole
stomach lining eventually.

49
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,441
- Milo.
- What?

50
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,019
- You gotta
disappear for a few hours.

51
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,250
<i>- Okay.</i>

52
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,724
- Hey freak.

53
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,635
Don't ignore me mother fucker.

54
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,369
- Yeah it's time to go home freak.

55
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,909
- Yo lock up your dogs.

56
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,713
- You're a weird
ass mother fucker yo.

57
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,613
- The elevator's broken.

58
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,442
This way.

59
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,959
- Hello?

60
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,807
Could you help me with my bags'?

61
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,565
Thanks so much.

62
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,297
- What floor?
- Nine.

63
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,340
What's your name?
- Milo.

64
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,118
- Holy shit, thanks again.

65
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,887
- Goodnight.

66
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:50,996
Does that hurt?

67
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,362
- What the fuck'?

68
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,974
- I'm sorry, I saw you here earlier.

69
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,401
- Yeah.

70
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,641
They're dicks.

71
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,422
You want a drink'?

72
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,382
- Sure.

73
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,866
I guess that was a stupid question.

74
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,989
- What?

75
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,328
- Does it hurt?

76
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,358
" Sex?

77
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,062
Not really.

78
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,398
- No.

79
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,568
- <i>Oh,</i>

80
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,047
yeah I mean it's like,

81
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,313
it's like a release.

82
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,289
Well it's not like I'm
making that arm any uglier.

83
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,191
- What's that?

84
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,284
- Psoriasis.

85
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,131
It's not catchy or anything, don't worry.

86
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,033
- Can you catch it from blood'?

87
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,264
- What?

88
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,931
- Like can I get it from your blood?

89
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,510
- No no no it's not like that.

90
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,401
- Can I see?

91
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,138
Can I see'?

92
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,628
- Oh my god gross.

93
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,052
- Sorry-

94
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,458
- I mean, I mean kind of sweet, but gross.

95
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,945
Oh you're really into...
- Vampires.

96
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,103
- I was gonna say scary movies.

97
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,375
- No, vampires.

98
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,651
- Like Twilight?

99
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,712
- Yeah, no.

100
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,353
I don't know, I haven't watched it.

101
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,589
- Well you should they're really good.

102
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,939
- Do you want to watch a video?

103
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,023
- The average American

104
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,652
consumes 120 pounds of beef per year.

105
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,459
In a typical month
slaughterhouses across the country

106
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,898
will kill nearly three million cows

107
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,469
and 385,000 lambs.

108
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,009
Each individual on the assembly line

109
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,945
has his own specialty...

110
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,044
- I need to go, I'm
late for this thing so.

111
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,208
- Yeah.

112
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,016
Sorry.

113
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,428
- It's fine, I just, I just have to go.

114
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,089
- What the fuck you doing'?

115
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,212
- Nothing.

116
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,687
- Let her go.

117
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,471
- Look at her, look at her.

118
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,247
- Hello?

119
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,963
Hello?

120
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,597
- Milo!

121
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,480
Hey, Milo wait up.

122
00:23:59,037 --> 00:23:59,811
Hi.

123
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,905
- Hi.

124
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,380
- Where are you going'?

125
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,281
- Home.

126
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,183
- Walking?

127
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:04,981
- Yeah.

128
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,555
- Cool, can I walk with you?

129
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,678
- Sure.

130
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,224
- Do people ever tell
you you don't talk a lot'?

131
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,352
- No.

132
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
- Really?

133
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,528
- No one ever speaks to me.

134
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,251
Sorry for showing you that video.

135
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,250
- Don't worry about it.

136
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,514
My friend Leo loves sick videos like that.

137
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,615
He used to show me that
kind of stuff all the time.

138
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,954
I mean it's no big deal I just had to go.

139
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,357
- No, it's fine.

140
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,537
- Do you ever think about suicide?

141
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,835
- Not really.

142
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,001
Can't kill myself.

143
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,804
- You can't kill yourself?

144
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:03,969
- Yeah.

145
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,308
I can't.

146
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,576
- Like against your religion'?

147
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,018
- I mean, yeah sure, it's just the rules.

148
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,087
It's just the way it is.

149
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,057
My morn killed herself.

150
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,662
- Oh my god, I'm sorry.

151
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,127
- It's fine.

152
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,029
It's just something that happened.

153
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,666
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

154
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,159
- Do you want to go to the
movies with me tomorrow?

155
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,289
- Yeah, okay.

156
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,558
- Okay, cool.

157
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,465
- What time?

158
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,201
- Noon.

159
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,310
I'll stop by your place.

160
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
- Hi.

161
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,502
- Hi.

162
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,705
Ready?

163
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,352
- Did you like it?

164
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,924
- I thought it was interesting,

165
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,219
I liked the music,

166
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,521
but I still think Twilight is better.

167
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,823
You should see it, or read it,

168
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,659
you know at least the first one.

169
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,664
- I prefer Let the Right One In.

170
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,928
- What's that?

171
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,196
- Maybe I'll show it to you some day.

172
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,293
<i>- Okay.</i>

173
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,138
You know you're the only
one who hasn't like,

174
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,610
immediately asked me what I'm doing here.

175
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,341
- Do you live with your parents?

176
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,645
- No my grandfather, he's pretty awful.

177
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,648
I mean I guess the best
thing about him is that,

178
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:37,089
is that he's slow so he
can't catch me that often.

179
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,320
- Catch you?

180
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,124
- Yeah he's a violent motherfucker.

181
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,927
Put a cigarette out on me last week.

182
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,728
I almost went to the cops.

183
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,031
- Well,

184
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,298
guess you don't like your grandpa much.

185
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,999
- Yeah it's fucked up.

186
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,369
- Where's your dad?

187
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,274
- He's dead, they're both dead.

188
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,209
- On.

189
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,780
Mine too.
- Really?

190
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,952
- Yeah, my dad died when I was like eight,

191
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,249
but he got sick when I was like six.

192
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,723
I mean it was, it took a
long time for him to die,

193
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:15,024
but when he did die it was
like a release you know?

194
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:19,192
He was yelling and screaming all the time.

195
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,998
- Jesus.
- Yeah, it is what it is.

196
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,374
It's just, I bet the vampires in Twilight

197
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,804
aren't very realistic.

198
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,935
- There's no such thing
as a realistic vampire.

199
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,408
- There is.

200
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,572
I mean more realistic.

201
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,206
I mean, vampires don't twinkle.

202
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,188
- Okay so what are vampires like?

203
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:16,054
- Well, I think it starts
with drinking blood,

204
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,858
like you have a need to.

205
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,259
It's like when you have
a cut on your finger

206
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,297
when you're a little kid
and you're sucking on it

207
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,597
but eventually that's not good enough

208
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,237
so you switch to animals
and stuff like that

209
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,431
and then you know, people.

210
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:35,011
And well you change a lot
after the first person you kill

211
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,206
and you change a lot more
after, after one after another.

212
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,779
But I think when you first
start oft being a vampire

213
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,051
all the stuff you see in the
movies doesn't really matter.

214
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,783
Like you can go out in the
sun and you can eat garlic.

215
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,917
I don't even think the
church stuff is even true,

216
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,327
like maybe it's a
religious vampire you know?

217
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,830
And I don't think you get bit,

218
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,903
I think it's like a disease you get.

219
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,026
- Wow.

220
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,538
Which book is this?

221
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,939
- It's not a book it's
just how I think it is.

222
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,512
Vampires existed before books did.

223
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,206
- Well the sun kills them in True Blood.

224
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,492
- I did not watch that show,

225
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,585
it did not look like it was
gonna be realistic at all.

226
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,646
- Oh my god you should it's so good

227
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,314
and this one, in this one episode,

228
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,927
the vampire that makes Eric

229
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,256
starts feeling like really
bad about what he does

230
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,662
so he kills himself, he like
goes up on a roof I think

231
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,464
and then the sun comes
up and just kills him.

232
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:37,904
- I mean it could be true

233
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,135
but I don't think a
vampire can kill himself.

234
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,438
- Why not?

235
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,174
- I don't know it's
like an animal instinct.

236
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,680
- So, they get to live forever?

237
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,842
- Maybe.

238
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,054
I don't know yet.

239
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,230
- Do you go to their graves'?
- No.

240
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,867
I don't go to my mom's grave,

241
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,305
I wouldn't even know where to go.

242
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,900
- What do you mean?

243
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,210
- My brother handled everything

244
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,908
and he doesn't like to talk about it.

245
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,914
- You didn't go to the funeral'?

246
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,883
- No, they said I shouldn't.

247
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,720
- Well then why not ask him'?

248
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,827
- I don't think that's a good idea,

249
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,057
he's weird about it, he
doesn't like to talk about it.

250
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,758
- That's so fucked up.

251
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,599
Would you go if you knew where she was?

252
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,072
- I guess.

253
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,440
- I'm gonna find
her, I mean, do you mind?

254
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,177
- I guess not.

255
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,350
- I'll go with you to yours

256
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,582
and then you can come
with me to mine, deal?

257
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,419
- Okay.

258
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,548
- Cool.

259
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,157
- Yo freak!

260
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,366
- No no that's not good
enough freak come over here.

261
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,942
- No no just keep walking.

262
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,204
- It's best if we go.

263
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,282
- What's up, who's your girlfriend?

264
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,557
- My name's Sophie.

265
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,450
- Hey why you slumming
over in the ghetto Sophie'?

266
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,118
- Haven't you seen her,
she live around here.

267
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,816
- Yo that ass, no fucking way my nigger.

268
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,585
- You all right white bitch?

269
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,718
I'm sorry I don't mean no
offense I'm just playing.

270
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,418
So why you living here white bitch?

271
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,678
- I live with my grandfather.

272
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,163
- Is he that mean old white motherfucker

273
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,361
up on the ninth floor?

274
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,196
- Can we go?

275
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:52,138
- Of course you can go I
ain't your fuckin' daddy.

276
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,470
Tell your brother I said hi freak.

277
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,609
Come on man.
- Jungle fever.

278
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,340
- Fuck them man.

279
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,953
- They seemed nice.

280
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,887
- They're in a gang.

281
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,048
Some of them have killed people.

282
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,286
- Don't, that was sarcasm.

283
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,258
- I had fun tonight, I'm sorry about...

284
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,689
- Goodnight.

285
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,325
- Yeah.

286
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,776
Milo.

287
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,903
Wake up.

288
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:37,076
Wake up.

289
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,078
- What?

290
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,055
- There's some white
girl waiting outside for you.

291
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,289
- Hound her.

292
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,688
So what's your favorite vampire movie?

293
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,629
- I guess the most realistic,

294
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,166
like I like Martin a
lot, it's this 70's one,

295
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,963
and it's good, it's realistic,

296
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,040
and Near Dark is really good
it's pretty cool and realistic

297
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,904
and the one I was telling you
about, Let the Right One In.

298
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,477
I'm not sure how realistic it is,

299
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,945
I mean like she can climb on walls

300
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,678
and I think maybe they're
just really good climbers,

301
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,844
and Shadow of the Vampire, it's good,

302
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,479
it's pretty cool and realistic.

303
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,225
- Do you miss her'?

304
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,729
- I guess I do.

305
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,889
It was about the making of Nosferatu-.

306
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,061
- I miss them.

307
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,147
I forgot to bring flowers.

308
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:15,978
- What does it matter

309
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,087
whether you brought flowers or not'?

310
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,849
She's not gonna know.

311
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,130
- You want to talk?

312
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,263
- Not really.

313
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,630
- Yo it's that white girl again

314
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,099
she's at the door.

315
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,837
- Tell her I'm not home.

316
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,204
- Really?

317
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,564
- Yeah.

318
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,724
- Go ask him.
- Yeah'?

319
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,853
- Yeah, ask him, now now now.

320
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,161
Hey, hey bro, little brother.
- Hey kid.

321
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,002
- Hey what's up man.

322
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,968
We were just wondering

323
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,371
if you knew where we could buy some C?

324
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,501
- Yeah, please, or
we could give you some molly.

325
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,772
- Dude don't, don't sell anything.

326
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,146
Dude we're just wondering, you
know, could you help us out,

327
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:55,944
if you knew someone or?

328
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,217
- We're visiting from out of town

329
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,348
and we were hoping to
party tonight.

330
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,287
- Yeah I'll help you.
- Cool.

331
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,724
- Come on.
- Yeah awesome.

332
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,296
Alright I'll be right back.

333
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,857
Hey wait up.

334
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,597
Hey!

335
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,621
Oh Shit-.

336
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,206
- Come on.

337
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,655
- Hello?

338
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,062
Hello?

339
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,708
Yo I'm gonna leave,
this is kinda fucked up.

340
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,721
Hey what's up?

341
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,691
You guys must be them, right'?

342
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,388
I'm looking for some C or
some molly if you got it.

343
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,556
- Wait hold up what?

344
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,794
- Cocaine or molly?

345
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,636
- Oh so you think everybody
that live up in here

346
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,365
is a drug dealer?

347
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,940
- No, dude this kid sent me here...

348
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,375
- Why the fuck you asking for
drugs if you don't think that?

349
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:40,041
- Whoa, whoa okay, I'm sorry,
I don't think anything...

350
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,809
- You don't think you fucking racist.

351
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,919
- Whoa, I'm not racist okay.

352
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,146
- That's exactly
what we fucking need.

353
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,688
- Fuck, you a cop?

354
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,389
- Okay this is just a
misunderstanding I think.

355
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,122
- This is a misunderstanding,
this motherfucker.

356
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,698
- Okay I'm just gonna go now.

357
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,391
You guys are on the door.

358
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,661
- Now shut the fuck up.

359
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,168
Little G, Little G,

360
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,933

361
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,371
- Let's fuck him up.

362
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,673
- You hear that?
- Dudes come on look.

363
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,574
- Get him, go ahead
get him, fuck him up.

364
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,905
- On shit.

365
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:10,875
- Yo what the fuck is wrong with you

366
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,207
hitting a little kid huh?

367
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,949
- What the tuck do you think this is huh'?

368
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,292
You come up here talking about drugs

369
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,989
and then you're gonna swindle Little G?

370
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,098
Hey man, stop crying, come over here.

371
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,734
You want to hang with us'?

372
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,823
Shoot this bitch.

373
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,369
- What?

374
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,493
- Chill.

375
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,605
Shut up.

376
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,575
You gonna do it or not?

377
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,813
- Wait what are you doing?

378
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,042
Wait, please, please.

379
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,173
- Oh shit wait.

380
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,953
I didn't know he was
gonna pull the trigger.

381
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,254
- Come on man!
- Well I had the safety on.

382
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,922
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?

383
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,096
- Shit, come on, speed out, come on.

384
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,168
- Hey!

385
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,801
Hey you, tell me where Mike is.

386
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,368
Stop, hey!

387
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:19,906
- You passed my building.
- Hold on just a minute.

388
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,307
Oh yeah, right here looks good right'?

389
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,425
- Do you think they're gonna snitch?

390
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,896
- Thanks Milo, stay safe.

391
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,169
- Welcome home.

392
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,141
Where you been last night?

393
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,474
This place been crazy.

394
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,911
- Yeah I bet.

395
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,017
- We were on TV.

396
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,208
- We were?

397
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,449
- Our building.

398
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,857
Someone killed a white
boy in the basement.

399
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,950
- No shit?

400
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:19,063
- Yeah, it's been crazy, it's
been on all the news channels.

401
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,596
- Cool.

402
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,118
- Why are you avoiding me?

403
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,728
- I'm not avoiding you.

404
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:48,853
- Liar.

405
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,362
- I'm not a liar.

406
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,031
- Well liar I got you this.

407
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,402
It's Twilight.

408
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,532
- I see that.

409
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,906
- Promise me you'll read it?

410
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,038
- I promise.

411
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:48,704
- Milo?

412
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,948
What are you doing in here?

413
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,384
Come on get out.

414
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,732
Are you gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

415
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,099
I heard you talked to the police.

416
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,864
- I didn't talk to them, they took me in.

417
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,303
- Then why'd they give
you a ride home then

418
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,431
if you didn't talk to them?

419
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,772
- They said that if I didn't help them

420
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,140
that they'd make it seem like I snitched.

421
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,801
- Hey they'll kill you

422
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,487
if they even think you talked to them.

423
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,612
- I didn't tell them anything.

424
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,743
- Alright, you know it
doesn't matter what I think.

425
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,845
You saw it?

426
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,124
- Yeah.

427
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,282
- Shit-.

428
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,632
Did they see you see it?

429
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,755
- No.

430
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,460
I don't know.

431
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,741
- Milo I can't protect you from them.

432
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,369
You know that right'?

433
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,740
- Lewis, stop.

434
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,638
<i>- Okay.</i>

435
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,940
Okay.

436
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,820
- Lewis.

437
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,489
- And don't trust the
cops either, alright?

438
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,326
They're frame you tor that
shit just 'cause they can.

439
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,729
- Okay I get it.

440
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,396
- Listen to your older brother.

441
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,369
- Alright I understand.

442
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,230
- Alright.

443
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,321
- So this is what you do, you sit up here?

444
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,414
- I study.

445
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,055
- That's cool.

446
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,896
Do you believe in God?

447
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:48,730
- No.

448
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,859
Do you?

449
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,028
- I guess.

450
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,930
Yeah.

451
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,676
I had a feeling that you didn't.

452
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,610
- I mean like, I think we're all special.

453
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,512
I believe in that, I guess it's magical,

454
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,119
but I don't think anyone intended anything

455
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,722
and I think when you die you're just,

456
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,346
you're just gone.

457
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,221
- Don't say that, it's so fucking creepy.

458
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,054
- It's true, I think.

459
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,995
- Okay, okay moving on.

460
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,603
What would you do with a million dollars?

461
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,004
- What if I told you I had $1,000,000?

462
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,371
- Then I'd steal it.

463
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,738
- You would?

464
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,900
- No,

465
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,243
but I'd ask to borrow some.

466
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,611
- What would you do with it'?

467
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,348
- Get out of here, you know, move out.

468
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,155
- Where would you go?

469
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,281
- Anywhere.

470
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,753
But I have a cousin in Alabama.

471
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,127
She let me stay there.

472
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,168
I could pitch in, probably go there.

473
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,426
- Cool.

474
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:04,006
- Okay so what would you
do with a million dollars?

475
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,477
- I've got plans.

476
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,270
- That's it'?

477
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,046
- Yeah, I've got plans.

478
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,938
- Thanks.

479
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,084
- You're welcome.

480
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,319
- Asher.

481
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,719
- Bye.

482
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:15,764
- Yo Milo.

483
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,041
You talking to five, O?

484
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,137
- No.

485
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,984
- That's not what we heard.

486
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,144
- You heard wrong, I don't do that.

487
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,155
- That kid screamed like
a little bitch right?

488
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,121
- I don't know what you're talking about.

489
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,390
- Oh come on you don't think he screamed

490
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,018
like a little bitch?

491
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:39,066
It's alright, Malik said he saw you there.

492
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,156
Right Malik?

493
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,867
- I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,099
- Don't act fucking smart okay?

495
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,229
- I'm not.

496
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,301
Can I go?

497
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,244
- This ain't over.

498
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,975
- Do you want to do it again?

499
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:26,936
Stop.

500
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,490
So I'll see you tomorrow then?

501
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,649
- Yeah.

502
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:44,954
- Bye.

503
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,027
- Uh-huh I see you bro.

504
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:52,871
- Lewis.

505
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,168
- What?

506
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,778
That was nice.

507
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,045
- Lewis!

508
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,424
- What?

509
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,619
- What day is it?

510
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,820
- Friday.

511
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,092
- No, the date.

512
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,595
- 14th-.

513
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,575
. Hey-

514
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,321
- Hey, what's up?

515
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:18,947
- Nothing.

516
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,626
Can I watch TV with you'?

517
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,438
- The neighbors heard me screaming

518
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:36,342
and threatened to call
the cops so he let me go.

519
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,774
- Are you hurt?

520
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:46,319
- No, I don't think I need to
go to the doctor or anything.

521
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,855
I just really don't want to go back there.

522
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,427
- She okay?

523
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,516
- Yeah.

524
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,669
- Can I stay here'?

525
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,930
- Sure.

526
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,314
- Where's the ChapStick?

527
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,116
Where's the ChapStick?

528
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,593
Where's the ChapStick?

529
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,329
Where's the ChapStick?

530
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,203
Where's the ChapStick?

531
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,678
Where's the ChapStick?

532
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,118
Where's the ChapStick?

533
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,804
- Don't you think you
should get your stuff'?

534
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,544
- You really thought I've
been in the same outfit

535
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,241
for like a week?

536
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,374
- And borrowing my clothes.

537
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,940
I mean it's tine, it's just,
you have to eventually right?

538
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,387
I mean it's tine, it's just,
you have to eventually right?

539
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,477
- Yeah.

540
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,646
- You can stay here as
long as you need to.

541
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,469
<i>- Okay.</i>

542
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,470
<i>- Okay.</i>

543
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,205
Thanks.

544
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,404
Are you sure you don't mind me not coming?

545
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,837
- It's fine.

546
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:28,497
Used to spending time by myself anyways.

547
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,206
Used to spending time by myself anyways.

548
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,037
- Thanks.

549
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,180
Oh and then...

550
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,915
- Oh we'll get your stuff.

551
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:42,511
Think I've convinced Lewis to come.

552
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,856
Think I've convinced Lewis to come.

553
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,259
- Okay let's see.

554
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,494
- We'll do it, see you soon.

555
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,779
- Hi.

556
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,183
. Hey-

557
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,053
- Sorry I was, I was
wondering if you had a stamp,

558
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,014
- Sorry I was, I was
wondering if you had a stamp,

559
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,865
and an envelope?

560
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,097
- No.

561
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:37,766
- No?

562
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,179
- I don't know.

563
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,414
- Okay, okay then.

564
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,542
- So you really like him?

565
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,053
- Yeah, I do.

566
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,398
- Hi, I'd like to cash this check

567
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,132
and pay these two bills with it.

568
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,039
And can I get a money order?

569
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:11,780
- She didn't say anything, she just left.

570
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,819
- She didn't say anything, she just left.

571
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,066
- Hi.

572
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:08,336
I know,

573
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,337
I know,

574
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,678
I know you saw that stuff,

575
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,878
but if we could meet then,

576
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,651
if we could meet then I could explain.

577
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:29,962
- Seven,
two, three, four, nine, seven...

578
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,420
- God damn you.

579
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,822
- Fucking.

580
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:30,952
- Fucking faggot.

581
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,921
- You fucking loudmouth bitch.

582
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,122
- You fucking loudmouth bitch.

583
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,591
Shut up.

584
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:08,051
- I warned you.

585
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,073
- You look like shit.

586
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,389
- When you were there did you kill anyone?

587
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,660
- No.

588
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,630
No.

589
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,503
I saw a lot of parts,

590
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,274
you know like body parts after bombings

591
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:12,180
but no I never killed no one, why?

592
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,054
- I was just wondering.

593
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,333
- You do what you have to do,

594
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,199
no matter what.

595
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:39,075
Whatever it is you're doing,

596
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:44,277
there's someone doing a
whole lot worse, you know'?

597
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,607
- I guess.

598
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:53,288
- No, ain't no guess,
you gotta remember that.

599
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,361
No matter how bad you think you done

600
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,862
there's somebody doing a whole lot worse

601
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,365
who's doing now.

602
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:00,488
- You think?

603
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,864
- You can trust me, I know.

604
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,266
I fucking know.

605
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,404
Ain't nothing you doing as
bad as what people are doing

606
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,479
all the time to each other.

607
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,329
You know what people
just close their eyes to

608
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,542
and let happen.

609
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,253
You know I bet whatever it
is you're worried about,

610
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:26,484
it ain't nothing compared
to the shit that goes on.

611
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:28,749
- Yeah.

612
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,679
Goodnight Lewis.

613
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,885
- Goodnight Milo.

614
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:57,678
- What?

615
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,092
- Milo and Lewis.

616
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,763
You know it's like she gave us names

617
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,559
she knew we get our asses kicked.

618
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,626
- Yeah.

619
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,097
- I miss her.

620
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,076
- I miss her too.

621
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:37,618
- Hi.

622
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,793
I'm sorry for leaving like that

623
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,235
and for not speaking to you.

624
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,807
I wasn't snooping I was just
looking for a pen and paper.

625
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,349
I didn't even really know what it meant,

626
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,920
but it kind of freaked me out.

627
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,782
I mean I shouldn't have
just left like that.

628
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,120
I'm sorry.

629
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,249
- It's fine.

630
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,028
- So, so what was all that?

631
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,403
Are you working on a book about vampires,

632
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,439
a crazy killer or something?

633
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:28,239
- It's nothing that matters any more.

634
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:31,840
- Really, 'cause it
seemed really detailed.

635
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,085
Did you come here to write more'?

636
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:45,892
- I'm not writing anymore,
I'm making a plan.

637
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,453
- Shit, you're just
giving all this to me?

638
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,290
- Yeah.

639
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,228
- Why the fuck would you do that?

640
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,425
- So we can trust each other again.

641
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,901
I never spoke to the cops.

642
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,700
- Is this stuff hot'?
- Yeah, very.

643
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:31,601
- You got all this yourself?

644
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:32,734
- Yeah.
- How?

645
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,511
- I broke into places.

646
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:41,054
- It's a lot of valuable shit.

647
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,945
- So we're cool?

648
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,991
- Yeah motherfucker whatever.
- Okay.

649
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:29,957
- Wow.

650
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:33,069
- Lewis said girls like flowers.

651
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,504
- They mostly do.

652
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,115
Thanks.

653
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:47,272
This was nice.

654
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,880
- Yeah.

655
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,016
- Hey.

656
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,104
- What?

657
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:28,353
- What's with your fucking crazy eyes?

658
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,510
- Huh?

659
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,446
- Drink?

660
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,279
- I wanted to give you something.

661
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:02,443
- Really?

662
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,479
- Yeah.

663
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,107
It's for you to go to your cousin's.

664
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,073
- Where did you get it?

665
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:31,282
- Don't tell anyone you
have it, just, just go.

666
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,786
- Do you want to come with me?

667
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,088
I mean you have to come with me.

668
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,648
- I can't.
- Why not'?

669
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:41,487
- You wouldn't like me in the end.

670
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,062
I'm not good, I never will be.

671
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,332
- No but I already know that you're crazy.

672
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:53,940
- I'm not going, just,
just make sure you go.

673
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,029
- Milo.

674
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,404
- Drop the fucking gun!

675
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,622
- Women's history in this regard

676
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:46,385
tries to merge two approaches,

677
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:48,994
that have been used in the past.

678
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,857
There's contribution history,

679
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,726
which views women as...

680
01:24:58,693 --> 01:24:59,831
- Can I go?

681
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,975
- You know we can't end early.

682
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:04,065
- Can I draw?

683
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:08,375
- What would you draw?

684
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,848
- I've been drawing the sun a lot lately.

685
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,525
- So you heard huh?
- No.

686
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:23,154
- They arrested all of them.

687
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,697
Andre, Troy, Mal, all of them.

688
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,300
- You mean all your old friends?

689
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,768
- Yeah.

690
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,168
Don't remind me.

691
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:36,704
You didn't know'?

692
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,445
- No, why would I?

693
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,514
- It's on the news even.

694
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,081
They say they killed that
white boy in the basement

695
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,449
and some white family in the Village.

696
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,574
- Really?

697
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,051
- You didn't know'?

698
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,145
- No.

699
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:53,547
- Yep-

700
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:57,179
- I just wanted to see if you left.

701
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,312
Call me.

702
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,651
- Hey freak.

703
01:27:58,506 --> 01:27:59,712
- Hey.

704
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,986
Now you're not calling me?

705
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,649
Call me back, maybe come and meet me?

706
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:03,100
- I read Twilight,
I thought it sucked,

707
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:05,430
not very realistic at all.

708
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:28,450
I've been thinking a lot

709
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,587
and maybe a vampire can kill himself.

710
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,964
I mean maybe not kill
himself but arrange it.

711
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,407
Like if he could do something

712
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,604
and know that it would get him killed.

713
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:53,812
That would get around the rule I think.

714
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:11,796
I'm not sure vampires
should, are meant to be here,

715
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,838
I mean I know they've always been here.

716
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:18,068
But I mean if you can
only exist to hurt people

717
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,872
and you know better

718
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:24,210
then maybe it's better to
decide not to exist at all.
