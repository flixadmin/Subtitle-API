<i>Katie!</i>

00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,043
<i>Cora!</i>

3
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,087
<i>You love your sister?</i>

4
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,338
<i>You make any noise,
you know what happens.</i>

5
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,846
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,348
How am I
looking, Paul?

7
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,141
That's better.
That's better.

8
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,701
Morning,
Mr. Edgecomb.

9
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,036
Some Danish
this morning?

10
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,247
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

11
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,999
Leftover's fine.

12
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,460
Dry and cold,
same as always.

13
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,586
Cold is better.

14
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,213
Hmm.

15
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,048
Especially on
those long walks.

16
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,717
Am I right?

17
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,054
Don't let Nurse
Godzilla catch you.

18
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,722
She'll raise holy hell.

19
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,974
You know we're not supposed
to let you wander off.

20
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,897
Where do you go every day?

21
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,232
What do you do
up in those hills?

22
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,150
Just walk.

23
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,444
I like to walk.

24
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,990
You try not to
fall down, bust a hip.

25
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,411
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

26
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,524
<i>What? Do you
want this man constantly in your life?</i>

27
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,401
<i>Explain the moral
basis of that.</i>

28
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,486
<i>I admit
I've made mistakes.</i>

29
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,154
<i>Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.</i>

30
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,490
<i>No, it's not...
She can't ask nothin</i>', <i>okay?</i>

31
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,532
<i>You can't ask nothin'.</i>

32
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:24,909
<i>I had six kids myself.</i>

33
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,662
Why do we always
watch this stuff?

34
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,915
It's interesting.

35
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,375
Interesting?

36
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,711
Bunch of inbred
trailer trash?

37
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,589
All they ever talk
about is fucking.

38
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,133
<i>It ain't no way
in this God green earth</i>

39
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:42,760
<i>I'm gonna have
a father like that!</i>

40
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,929
<i>If what you say is true...</i>

41
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,347
No,
<i>I'm talking now!</i>

42
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,932
<i>I'm talking now!</i>

43
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,016
<i>What kind of
a mother are you?</i>

44
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,684
<i>One that
causes people more than...</i>

45
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,229
<i>...is going to let
you try the Body Strider...</i>

46
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,314
<i>You're dead!
You can't come back!</i>

47
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>It's back.
The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.</i>

48
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,153
<i>All right, all right.
Take my husband, take my kids...</i>

49
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,072
Are you all right?

50
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,198
Hmm?

51
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,825
You look tired.
You're not yourself.

52
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,245
No, I'm... I'm fine.
I promise.

53
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,248
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day,

54
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,791
that's what I think.

55
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,751
Not that you asked me.

56
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,462
I just didn't
sleep well, is all.

57
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,758
I had a few bad dreams.
It happens. It...

58
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,010
I'll be fine.

59
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,637
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

60
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>Oh, if
Madge doesn't care, I certainly don't.</i>

61
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,399
<i>Neither do I.
All I know is...</i>

62
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,442
Now, this here
is worth a look.

63
00:06:40,442 --> 00:07:10,442
<b>Subtitle | www.movieddl.me</b>

64
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,323
Paul, what is it?

65
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,909
My God.

66
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,709
I've got to get out of here.

67
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,276
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you

68
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,237
whether you want it to
or not. It's silly.

69
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,241
Was it the film?
It was, wasn't it?

70
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,246
I haven't spoken of these
things for a long time, Ellie.

71
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,499
Over 60 years.

72
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,001
Paul, I'm your friend.

73
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,968
I ever tell you that I was a prison
guard during the Depression?

74
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,887
Uh, you've mentioned it.

75
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,474
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row,

76
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,685
that I supervised
all the executions?

77
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,026
Usually, death row is
called "The Last Mile."

78
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,530
We called ours
"The Green Mile."

79
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,950
The floor was
the color of faded limes.

80
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,286
We had the electric chair.

81
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,081
"Old Sparky,"
we called it.

82
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,210
Oh, I've lived
a lot of years, Ellie.

83
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,422
But, 1935,

84
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,298
that takes the prize.

85
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,261
That year, I had

86
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,347
the worst urinary
infection of my life and...

87
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,767
It was...

88
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,854
It was also the year

89
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,981
of John Coffey and...

90
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,901
...the two dead girls.

91
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,946

Up on the tower!
New prisoners coming in!

You men down in the yard,
step off the fence! Clear that gate!

101

Put me through to E Block.

00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,160
E Block.

Yeah.

Paul? Prisoner.

107
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,939
Christ, give me a minute.

108
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,779
You all right in there?

109
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,035
For a man pissing razorblades,
yeah.

110

Oh.

112
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,136
You should've took the day
off, gone to see the doctor.

113
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,347
With a new arrival?
You know better.

114
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,391
Besides...

115
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,560
It's not as bad as it was.

116
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,478
I think it's clearing up.

117
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,233
All right. Let's look
alive, Dean. Yes, sir.

118
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,825
Damn.

119
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,329
They're riding on the axle.

120
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,340
What'd they do?

121
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,216
They bust the springs?

122
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,765
Holy...

123
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,268
Dead man!

125
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,105
Who...

126
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,524
We got
a dead man walking here!

127
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,070
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

128
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:01,990
Paul,

129
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,286
you might wanna reconsider
getting in the cell with this guy.

130
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,955
He's enormous.

131
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,040
Can't be bigger than you.

132
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,089
Dead man walking.

133
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,052
Dead man!

134
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054

We got a dead man

140
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,571
Dead man walking!

141
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,701
We got a dead man
walking here!

142
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,244
Percy.

143
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,121
That's enough.

144
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,771
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

145
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,902
Can you talk?

146
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,953
Yes, sir, boss.
I can talk.

147
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,590
Move your ass. Let's
go.

148
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,341
Come on.

149
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,681
Percy,

150
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,477
they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

151
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,397
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

152
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,816
No. They got all
the men they need.

153
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,110
Why don't you just
go and make sure?

154
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,988
Uh-uh.

155
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,239
I don't care
where you go, Percy,

156
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,658
just as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

157
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,289
All right.

158
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,383
Ow!

159
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,346
God, you bust my finger.

160
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,265
I wiped that grin off your
shit-poked face, didn't I?

161
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,601
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

162
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,816
Uh-huh.

163
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,740
Fuck you, Percy.

164
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,408
We're gonna get
that looked at, Del.

165
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,119
In the meantime,
you just stay quiet.

166
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,704
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,545
I let Harry take
those chains off you.

168
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,296
You gonna be nice?

169
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,982
Your name is John Coffey.

170
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,276
Yes, sir, boss.

171
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,320
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

172
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,489
Oh, you can spell, can you?

173
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,117
Just my name, boss.

174
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,037
J-O-...

175
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,665
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

176
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,377
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger,

177
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,589
Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton,
these gentlemen right there.

178
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,301
Questions?

179
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,387
Do you leave
the light on after bedtime?

180
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,351
'Cause I get a little scared
in the dark sometime,

181
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,271
if it's a strange place.

182
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,988
It stays pretty bright
around here all night long.

183
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,533
We always keep a few lights
burning out in the corridor.

184
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,286
The corridor?

185
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,581
Right out there.

186
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,236
You can sit.

187
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,718
I couldn't help it, boss.

188
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,347
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

189
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,980
Dean, pull Delacroix's card,

190
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,147
take him down
to the infirmary,

191
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,565
see if those
fingers are broken.

192
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,900
Yes, sir.
Of course they're broken.

193
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,777
I heard the bones crack.

194
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,195
Did you hear
what he was yelling

195
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,780
when we brought
the big dummy in?

196
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,907
How could I miss it, Harry?
The whole prison heard.

197
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,993
Goddamn Percy.

198
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,621
You'll probably have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

199
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,416
Hmm. I'll chew that
food when I have to.

200
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,584
Right now I wanna hear
about this new inmate.

201
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,753
Aside from how
big he is, okay?

202
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,382
Monstrous big.
Damn.

203
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,801
Oh, he seems meek enough.

204
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,553
Is he retarded, you
figure? Mmm-hmm.

205
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,639
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

206
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,101
Imbecile or not, he deserves
to fry for what he done.

207
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,565
Make your blood curdle.

208
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,299
What? For God's sake, what?

209
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,302
The girls!
The girls are gone!

210
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,180
Papa! Papa, look!
There's blood.

211
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,061
Oh, my God.

212
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,987
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that
phone now! You tell them we headed west.

213
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,865
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

214
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,618
Central! Are you on the line?

215
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:05,538
Oh, God, please!
Somebody took my little girls!

216
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,094
Katie!

217
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,763
Cora!

218
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,212
Jesus.

219
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,464
Jesus.

220
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,977
I'll kill you!

221
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,357
I'll kill you!

222
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,304
I... I couldn't help it.

223
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,058
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

224
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,732
Boy, you under arrest
for murder.

225
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,903
I interrupt?

226
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,824
Well, I'm just
about done.

227
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,126
Hey,

228
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,462
how's that
pretty gal of yours?

229
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,633
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

230
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,593
Not so well at all.

231
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,888
More headaches?

232
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,308
Got laid up with
another one yesterday.

233
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,227
Worst one yet.

234
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,148
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

235
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,443
Head X-rays and
who knows what else.

236
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,154
She is scared to death.

237
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,659
Truth to tell, so am I.

238
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,955
If it's something they
can see on the X-ray,

239
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,207
maybe it's
something they can fix.

240
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,501
Maybe.

241
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,966
This just came in.

242
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,717
DOE on Bitterbuck.

243
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,723
You didn't come all the way
down here just to hand me a DOE.

244
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,853
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

245
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,898
Is it true you ordered
Percy Wetmore off the block?

246
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:19,983
It is.

247
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,736
Now, I'm sure
you had reason, Paul,

248
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,072
but like it or not,

249
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,908
the wife of the governor of
this state has only one nephew,

250
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,035
and his name happens
to be Percy Wetmore.

251
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,079
Little Percy calls his aunt,

252
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,207
and squeals like
a schoolroom sissy.

253
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,628
He also mention
he assaulted a prisoner

254
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,630
this morning out
of sheer petulance?

255
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,550
Broke three fingers on
Eduard Delacroix's left hand?

256
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,093
I didn't hear that part.

257
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,136
I'm sure she didn't either.

258
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,430
The man is mean
and careless and stupid,

259
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,724
and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

260
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,935
Sooner or later, he's gonna
get somebody hurt or worse.

261
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,854
Stick with it, Paul.

262
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,647
It may not be much longer.

263
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,816
I have it on good authority

264
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,360
that Percy has an application
in at Briar Ridge.

265
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,155
Briar Ridge?
The mental hospital.

266
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,448
Administration job.

267
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,575
Better pay.

268
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,909
Hmm.

269
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,037
Then why is he
still here?

270
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,291
He can get that
application pushed through.

271
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,876
Hmm.

272
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,502
Hell, with his connections,

273
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,671
he could have
any state job he wants.

274
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,382
You know what I think?

275
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,429
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

276
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:38,019
Well, he'll get his chance,
then, won't he?

277
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,981
Maybe then he'll be
satisfied and move on.

278
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,691
In the meantime,

279
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,485
you'll keep the peace?

280
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,736
Of course.

281
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,822
Of course.

282
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,909
Thank you, Paul.

283
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,497
Hal,

284
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,834
you give
Melinda my love, okay?

285
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:05,421
I'm sure that X-ray will
turn out to be nothing at all.

286
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,841
You bet.

287
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,536
Paul.

288
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,913
Hey, you.
Hey.

289
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,207
The music too loud?

290
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,961
There's just this big,
empty spot in the bed

291
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,879
where my husband
usually sleeps.

292
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,636
He said to tell you he's having a
little trouble with that tonight.

293
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,933
Worried about
Melinda and Hal?

294
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,561
Is that what's
got you up?

295
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,604
Yeah, that...

296
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,983
...and things.

297
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,277
Things.

298
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,200
We got a new inmate today.

299
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,454
Simple-minded fella.

300
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,207
Do I wanna know
what he did?

301
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,626
No.
Mmm.

302
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:29,297
Things that
happen in this world.

303
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,675
It's a wonder God allows it.

304
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,223
Why don't you
come to bed?

305
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,560
I think I have something
to help you sleep.

306
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,644
Mmm.

307
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,022
Mmm. You can
have all you want.

308
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,276
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

309
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,612
I don't wanna
pass it on to you.

310
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,113
Have you seen
Doc Bishop yet?

311
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,198
No.

312
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,365
Paul.

313
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,495
Because he's just gonna
want me to take sulfa tablets,

314
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,579
and I'll spend
the rest of the week

315
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,997
puking in every
corner in my office.

316
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,124
It will run its
course all by itself.

317
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,084
Thank you very much
for your concern.

318
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,714
Poor old guy.

319
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,051
Oh.

320
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,939
Paul. Dean.

321
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,736
Yeah?

322
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,155
Come here. Go on.

323
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,702
I guess the legislature loosened
up the purse strings enough

324
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,704
to hire on a new guard.

325
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,173
Look again.

326
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,466
He's right...

327
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,176
...there.

328
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,980
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people this way.

329
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,857
Maybe it's rabid.

330
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,191
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my Christ.

331
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,276
Yeah, it could be.

332
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,111
Oh, the big
mouse expert.

333
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,113
The Mouse Man.

334
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,616
What, you see him foaming
at the mouth, Mouse Man?

335
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,076
I don't see its mouth at all.

336
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,130
Oh, Brutal, no.
We'll be hip-deep in mice.

337
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,465
I just wanna see
what he'll do.

338
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,968
In the interest
of science, like.

339
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,719
He's in the damn
restraint room.

340
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,763
And you just know he's chewing
the padding out of the walls,

341
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,307
making himself
a nice little nest.

342
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,064
All right.

343
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,858
Let's go get
the damn mouse.

344
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,746
Boss.

345
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,207
Saw me a mouse go by.

346
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,626
Can't put anything
over on you.

347
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,974
All right. Just watch
your toes. Watch your toes.

348
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,725
Yeah. All right.
Here we go.

349
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,119
You let him
get past you.

350
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,539
No, I did not. I've
been here all the time.

351
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,666
Then where the hell is he?

352
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,459
Well, I don't know.

353
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,171
Three grown men

354
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,216
outsmarted by a mouse.

355
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,512
Well,

356
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,305
bright side is,
all this commotion

357
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,182
probably scared
him off for good.

358
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,143
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,563
Yeah, that's
the last we'll see of him.

360
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,991
You little son of a bitch.

361
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,746
Well, I'll be damned.

362
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,748
There he is,
big as Billy-be-frigged.

363
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,042
I thought Brutal
was pulling my leg.

364
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,170
And that's a goddamn mouse.
Yeah.

365
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,007
Brute said he was
in here last night,

366
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,218
begging for food.

367
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,845
He comes right on
up to the desk.

368
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,765
Give him some room, Percy.
Huh?

369
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,100
Yeah, see what he does.

370
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,226
All right.

371
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,656
He's a brave little bastard.

372
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,533
Gotta give him that.

373
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,104
Damn!

374
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,898
You little scurvy!
Damn!

375
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,902
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?

376
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,196
I'm gonna kill you!
Percy!

377
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,534
I'm gonna take you out!
Percy! Percy!

378
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,663
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

379
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,498
It's just a little mouse,
dumb <i>merde.</i>

380
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,917
You ugly little piece of...

381
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,753
Are you
listening to me? Fuck!

382
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,921
Percy!

383
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,465
I'm gonna rip your
diseased head off,

384
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,259
you little piece of shit!

385
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,511
Get on out of there!

386
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,388
I want you to stop this!

387
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,766
Pipe down.
I'm talking to you.

388
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,230
Percy.

389
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,316
Hey, boss!
Hey, Captain, what's going on?

390
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,073
Percy met your mouse.

391
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,997
It's in here somewhere. I'm
gonna squish the little son of a bitch.

392
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,294
Percy, we already tried that.

393
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,464
Huh?

394
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,382
What'd you say?

395
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,092
I said that we...

396
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,514
Knock yourself out.

397
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,933
Hope you nail the bastard.

398
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,894
Oh, yeah.

399
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,908
Gosh. He ain't
in there, huh?

400
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,869
Don't that beat
the mousy band?

401
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,332
Percy,

402
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,628
you wanna think about
what you were doing just now?

403
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,214
I was trying to get the mouse.

404
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,632
Are you blind?

405
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,010
You also scared the living
crap out of me and Bill,

406
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,012
not to mention the inmates.

407
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,722
So what?

408
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,599
They aren't in cradle school,

409
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,685
in case you didn't notice.

410
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,187
Although you treat 'em
that way half the time.

411
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,440
We don't scare them any more
than we have to, Percy.

412
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,359
They're under
enough strain as it is.

413
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,403
Men under strain can snap.

414
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,073
Hurt themselves and hurt
others. That's why our job is...

415
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,575
...talking,

416
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,703
not yelling.

417
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:22,788
You'd do better
to think of this place

418
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,957
like it's an intensive
care ward of a hospital.

419
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,502
I think of it as a bucket
of piss to drown rats in.

420
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,587
That's all.

421
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,757
Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?

422
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,592
You can kiss my ass.

423
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,138
Don't.
Yeah, you try it. Go on.

424
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,431
Try it.

425
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,933
You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

426
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,852
Okay, Brutal.

427
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,616
We all know who your
connections are, Percy.

428
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,161
You ever threaten
a man on this block again,

429
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,204
we all gonna have a go.

430
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,956
Job be damned.

431
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,877
You done?

432
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,007
Get all this shit back
in the restraining room.

433
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,384
You are cluttering up my Mile.

434
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,657
Arlen,

435
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,619
your daughter
and her family are here.

436
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,212
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

437
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,093
Uh, settle down,
settle down!

438
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,345
Rehearsing now.
Everybody settle!

439
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,389
Arlen Bitterbuck,
step forward.

440
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,434
Stepping forward, stepping
forward, stepping forward.

441
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,186
Is his head
properly shaved?

442
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,979
Nope. It's all dandruffy,
and it smells.

443
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,982
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

444
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,486
Walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

445
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,281
walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

446
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,408
walking the Mile,

447
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,243
walking the Mile.

448
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,371
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

449
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,165
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

450
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,501
I'm sorry for all
the bad shit I've done

451
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,045
and people I've tramped on
and everything.

452
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,296
And I hope they forgive me,

453
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,299
and I'll never do it again,

454
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,426
that's for sure.

455
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:44,513
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here,

456
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,682
hooping, hollering
and shaking his dick, are we?

457
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,766
Well, actually...

458
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,184
Still praying, still praying.

459
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,936
Getting right with Jesus.

460
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,147
Do it quietly, you old gink!

461
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,607
As I was saying,
I don't believe

462
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,818
they actually shake
their dicks, Harry.

463
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,695
Be that as it may,
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,

464
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,488
so we've got
Reverend Schuster coming in.

465
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:05,284
Oh, he's good. He's fast, too.
Doesn't get 'em all worked up.

466
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,412
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

467
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,789
Getting to my feet.
Walking the Mile,

468
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,791
walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

469
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,751
walking the Green Mile.

470
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,628
Walking the Mile.

471
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,464
Walking in the Mile.

472
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,133
Sitting down now.

473
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,218
Sitting down.

474
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,721
I'm taking
a seat in Old Sparky.

475
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,181
What do I do?

476
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,683
Watch and learn.

477
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,393
Watch and learn.

478
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,233
Getting strapped.

479
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,986
Getting clamped.

480
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,239
Gettin' wired.

481
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,534
All right.

482
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,454
Getting all electrode.

483
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,586
Roll on one.

484
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,798
"Roll on one" means
I turn the generator up full.

485
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,176
You see the lights go
brighter in half the prison.

486
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,053
Arlen Bitterbuck,

487
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,014
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers

488
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,184
sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

489
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,103
You have anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

490
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,647
Yeah.

491
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,275
I want a fried chicken dinner
with gravy on the taters,

492
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,777
and I want to
shit in your hat.

493
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,530
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face

494
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,698
'cause I'm one
horny motherfucker.

495
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,121
You bastard.

496
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,124
That's a good one.

497
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,376
Quiet.

498
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,877
Quiet! Shut up!

499
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,004
Shut up!
Sorry, boss.

500
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,423
Toot,
one more remark like that,

501
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,217
I'll have Van Hay
roll on two for real.

502
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,637
And I'll have one less crazy
old trusty in the world.

503
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,806
It was pretty funny.

504
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,890
That's why I don't like it.

505
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,600
We'll be doing this
for real tomorrow night.

506
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,352
I don't want anybody
remembering some

507
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,646
stupid joke like that
and getting going again.

508
00:39:58,855 --> 00:39:59,940
You ever try not
to laugh in church

509
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,191
when something funny
gets stuck in your head?

510
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:03,402
It's the same goddamn thing.

511
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,530
I'm sorry, Paul.
You're right.

512
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,115
Let's keep going.

513
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,366
Harry.

514
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,497
Soak the sponge.

515
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,003
Putting on the black hood.

516
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,549
And I'm putting on my cap.

517
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,593
Why's he putting
that sponge on his head?

518
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,721
Conducts electricity directly
to the brain, fast like a bullet.

519
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,182
You don't ever throw the
switch on a man without that.

520
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,187
Hush up there, Toot.

521
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,776
Getting screwed.

522
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,987
I'm getting the cap.

523
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,201
Arlen Bitterbuck,

524
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,661
the electricity
shall now be passed

525
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,788
through your body
until you are dead

526
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,082
in accordance
with state law.

527
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,960
God have mercy
on your soul.

528
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,546
Amen.

529
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,216
Roll on two.

530
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,096
And that's that.

531
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,603
I'm frying! I'm frying!

532
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,066
I'm a done tom turkey!

533
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,403
This is a shocking experience!

534
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,283
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

535
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,206
Goodbye.

536
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,000
All right.
Let's do it again,

537
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,460
and let's get it
right this time.

538
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,879
Get that idiot
out of the chair.

539
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:49,568
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong,

540
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:55,031
that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him,

541
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,992
and live there forever?

542
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:01,580
Could that
be what heaven's like?

543
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,792
I just about believe
that very thing.

544
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,005
Hmm.

545
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,342
Had me a young wife
when I was 18.

546
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,430
Spent our first
summer in the mountains.

547
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,098
Made love every night.

548
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,518
And she'd lie there after,

549
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,481
bare-breasted
in the firelight.

550
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,902
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

551
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,073
That was my best time.

552
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,513
It'll be fine.

553
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,015
You'll do fine.

554
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,803
Arlen Bitterbuck,

555
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,347
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

556
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,600
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

557
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,937
God have mercy on your soul.

558
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:09,791
Roll on two.

559
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,462
Again.

560
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,304
<i>Adiós,</i> chief.

561
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,681
Drop us a card from hell.

562
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,391
Let us know
if it's hot enough.

563
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,563
He's paid what he owed.

564
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,483
He's square with
the house again.

565
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,069
So keep your
goddamn hands off him.

566
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,424
What's up his ass?

567
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,842
You.

568
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,054
Always. You, Percy.

569
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,807
On account I hate
the new boy?

570
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,225
That the way
it is around here?

571
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,313
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

572
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,525
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
I know all about it.

573
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,487
Sounds to me like
a pretty good job.

574
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,367
Yeah, I might just take it, too,
soon as you put me out front.

575
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,036
Yeah, you heard me.

576
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,206
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

577
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,878
Seeing a man die,
now that's not enough.

578
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,256
You gotta be close enough
to smell his nuts cook.

579
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,299
I just wanna be
out front, is all.

580
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,928
Come on. One time.

581
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,723
And then you know what?

582
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:32,600
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

583
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,394
And if I say no?

584
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,441
Well, I might just
stick around for good.

585
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,068
Make me a career of this...

586
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,821
Boss.

587
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,042
You are not
gonna believe this.

588
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:50,845
Look.

589
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:54,516
I done tame me that mouse.

590
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,352
We see that.

591
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,606
Oh, oh. Watch this.
Watch what he do.

592
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:10,490
Ain't he something now?

593
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,619
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

594
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,954
Mr. Jingles?

595
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,873
That his name.
He whispered in my ear.

596
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,292
Hey, captain...

597
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,586
Could I have
a box for my mouse

598
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,004
so he can sleep
in here with me?

599
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,757
I notice your English gets
better when you want something.

600
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,968
Wanna see
what else he can do?

601
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,720
Hmm? Watch, watch, watch.

602
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:36,224
Mr. Jingle?
Mr. Jingle, wanna play fetch?

603
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,476
Wanna play fetch?

604
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,020
Play fetch.
Watch, watch, watch.

605
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,209
He fetch it every time.
Every time.

606
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,337
That's some smart mouse, Del.

607
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,756
Like he a circus mouse
or somethin'.

608
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,969
Correct.
That just what he is, too.

609
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,304
He's a circus mouse.

610
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,222
When I get out of here,
he's gonna make me rich.

611
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,184
You just watch and
see if he don't do that.

612
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,436
Play fetch?
We play fetch again?

613
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:24,355
Well, well, well.

614
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,524
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend there, Del.

615
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:28,651
Don't hurt him.

616
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,404
Okay?

617
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,697
Is that the one I chased?

618
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:35,283
Yeah, that's the one.

619
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,328
Only Del says his name
is Mr. Jingles.

620
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,622
Is that so?

621
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,625
Del's been asking for a box.

622
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,211
Thinks the mouse will
sleep in it, I guess.

623
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,129
Might keep it for a pet.

624
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,841
What do you think?

625
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,721
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box,

626
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,641
and, uh,
get some cotton batting

627
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,643
from the dispensary
to line it with.

628
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,312
Yeah.

629
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,522
Yeah.
That should do real nice.

630
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,826
Man said get a cigar box.

631
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,296
Morning.

632
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,386
Hal, you wanted to see me?

633
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,554
Yeah.

634
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,890
Close the door.

635
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:49,607
So you know...

636
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:53,861
You got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

637
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,531
William Wharton.

638
00:51:57,532 --> 00:52:00,660
He's what you call
a problem child.

639
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,206
Got "Billy the Kid"
tattooed on his left arm.

640
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,836
Been rambling all over
the state last few years,

641
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,880
causing all kinds
of trouble.

642
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,550
Finally hit the big time.

643
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,762
Killed three people
in a holdup.

644
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,724
One of them a pregnant woman.

645
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,728
Bad news all around.

646
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,814
Hal?

647
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,744
It's a tumor, Paul.

648
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,913
A brain tumor.

649
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:49,751
They got...

650
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,419
X-ray pictures of it.

651
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,465
It's the size of a lemon,
they said.

652
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,802
And...

653
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:02,430
Way down...

654
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,601
Deep inside,
where they can't operate.

655
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,396
I haven't told her.

656
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,775
I can't think how.

657
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,989
For the life of me, Paul...

658
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,951
I can't think how
to tell my wife

659
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,749
she's going to die.

660
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,517
Oh.

661
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,060
Ah.

662
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,357
Aah.

663
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,252
Oh... Oh, God.

664
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:58,880
Oh, God.

665
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,343
I'm going.

666
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,470
What?

667
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:07,763
To see Dr. Bishop.
I'm going.

668
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,266
Today.

669
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,019
Soon as we get that
new inmate squared away.

670
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:14,979
That bad?

671
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,898
Oh, yeah.

672
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,422
The boy is doped
to the gills.

673
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,841
Hmm?

674
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,593
Dean, hand me
them clothes.

675
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,264
William Wharton?

676
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,976
Hey! You put on these
clothes now, you hear?

677
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,486
We're gonna have to do this.

678
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,240
Hellraiser, huh?

679
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,492
Look more
like a limp noodle to me.

680
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,452
Hey.

681
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,371
Hey.

682
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,915
You've been
declared competent, son.

683
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:17,667
You know what that means?

684
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,920
It means you're gonna
ride the lightning. Yeah.

685
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:24,674
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

686
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,009
Hellraiser.

687
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,834
Boss,
you don't look so good.

688
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,879
Look like you're
running you a fever.

689
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,470
Boss Edgecomb?

690
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,682
I needs to see you
down here, boss.

691
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,520
I got things to tend to just
now, John Coffey. You just...

692
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,984
You just stay still
in your cell.

693
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,456
E Block.

694
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,202
Come on, let's go.

695
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,455
Come on.
Look alive, big boy.

696
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,429
Careful.

697
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,977
- Careful.
- Step up. Step up.

698
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:17,763
Where you going?
Where you going?

699
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,145
Ain't this a party now?

700
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,688
Is it or what?
Let him go.

701
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,481
Shoot him.
Shoot! See who you hit.

702
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,442
Shoot the son of a
bitch. Come on, shoot me!

703
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:30,568
Shoot him!

704
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,154
Hit him, Percy!
God damn it! Hit him.

705
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:34,905
Hit me, you limp noodle.

706
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:35,990
Hit him, Percy!

707
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,241
God damn it, hit him!

708
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,784
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

709
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:40,411
Wharton, I'm warning you.

710
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,121
You warning me?
Warn me now.

711
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,414
I'm warning you!

712
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,499
- You're warning me?
- Shoot him!

713
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,334
Well, come on...

714
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:54,967
You're a big fucker.

715
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,386
Where'd you come from?

716
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:10,441
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

717
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,359
All right. Now, just breathe.

718
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,070
That's it.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

719
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,949
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

720
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,451
Didn't see it coming.
Come on, boy, breathe.

721
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,119
Didn't see it coming.

722
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,079
Come on. Just breathe.

723
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,876
We thought he was doped.

724
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:33,714
Didn't we? Didn't we all
of us think he was doped?

725
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,466
You didn't ask?

726
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,636
Well, I guess
that's not a mistake...

727
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,056
...you'll be needing to make
again anytime soon, is it?

728
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,573
You go get Dean and Harry
looked at. Make sure they're all right.

729
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,410
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

730
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,830
Start out by saying the
situation's under control.

731
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,914
It's not a story.

732
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,750
He will not appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

733
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:12,253
Well, what about you?
You're about ready to collapse.

734
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,339
Ah, I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

735
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,967
Go on, now. Go.

736
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,103
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

737
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:57,798
Boss,
I needs to see you down here.

738
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,222
This is not a good time,
John Coffey...

739
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:07,266
Not a good time at all.

740
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:11,353
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

741
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:34,835
Closer.

742
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,504
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

743
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,091
Mind your business, Del.

744
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,853
What do you want, John Coffey?

745
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:54,939
Just to help it.

746
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,152
Don't be afraid.

747
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:01,737
Help!

748
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,282
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

749
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,117
Help!

750
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,786
What are you doing?

751
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,496
Help!

752
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,708
Boss Howell! Help!

753
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,378
Boss
Stanton! Somebody, come!

754
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,713
Help!

755
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,771
Help!

756
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,190
Help! Boss Howell!
Boss Stanton!

757
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,485
Somebody, come! John
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

758
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,904
Del, for Christ sakes,
shut up!

759
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,870
What did you just do to me?

760
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,582
I helped it.

761
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,376
Didn't I help it?

762
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:42,254
I just took it back, is all.

763
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:45,466
Awful tired now, boss.

764
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:47,926
Dog-tired.

765
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,204
Boss,
what that man do to you?

766
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,352
Hey, honey.
How you feeling?

767
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,690
Oh, not too bad.

768
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,526
What did the doctor say?

769
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,322
Oh, you know doctors.

770
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,575
Gobbledygook, mostly.

771
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,077
Gobbledygook.

772
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,886
Having stew tonight.

773
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,856
What are you doing?

774
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:14,615
What does it feel like?

775
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,618
Well, I know
what it feels like.

776
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,457
It feels great.

777
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,401
Mmm.

778
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,493
Paul.
Yeah?

779
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,912
Not that I'm complaining...

780
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,288
Uh-huh.

781
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,542
But we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

782
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,419
Yeah, we did,
at your mom's, yeah.

783
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:10,796
Mmm-hmm.

784
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:14,007
Wanna tell me
what's going on?

785
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,845
Well...

786
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,099
See, the thing is...

787
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,728
I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

788
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,651
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

789
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,570
I'm thinking of taking
the morning off sick.

790
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,698
You cover the fort for me?

791
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,993
That's swell. Thanks.

792
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,954
Yeah, no.
I'm sure I'll feel better.

793
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,914
Okay. Okay.

794
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,130
You're sure
you ought to do this?

795
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,551
I'm not sure
what I'm sure of.

796
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:17,112
Burt, you got
some company.

797
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,115
Can I offer you
a cold drink?

798
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,868
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold
drink would be fine. Thank you.

799
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,870
Mr. Hammersmith,
your office said

800
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,830
I might find you
at home today.

801
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,582
Hope I'm not
troubling you.

802
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,418
Well, that depends, Mr...

803
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,589
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block
supervisor up on Cold Mountain.

804
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,342
The Green Mile.

805
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:41,386
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

806
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,972
I'd like to ask you
about one of 'em.

807
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,143
Have a seat.
Thank you.

808
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:53,940
Which client?

809
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,570
Now you got my
curiosity aroused.

810
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:00,489
John Coffey.

811
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:01,573
Ah.

812
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,200
Coffey.

813
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,576
He causing you problems?

814
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,536
No. No, can't say he is.

815
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,747
He doesn't like the dark
and cries on occasion,

816
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,540
but other than that...

817
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:13,919
He cries, does he? Well,
got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

818
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,796
You know what he did.

819
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:18,298
I read the court transcript.

820
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:20,509
Thank you, missus.

821
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:21,802
My pleasure.

822
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,223
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

823
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,933
Coming, Mama!

824
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,103
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

825
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:34,147
I've wondered if he ever
did anything like that before.

826
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,567
Why? Has he said anything?

827
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,362
No, but a man who
does a thing like that

828
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,240
has often developed
a taste for it over time.

829
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,117
It occurred to me

830
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,786
that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail.

831
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,162
Find out.

832
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,333
A man his size, and colored to
boot, can't be that hard to trace.

833
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,129
You'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

834
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:59,381
Believe me, we tried.

835
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,550
Like he'd dropped
out of the sky.

836
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:04,678
How can that be?

837
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,596
We're in a depression.

838
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,932
A third of the country's
out of work.

839
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,934
People are drifting
by the thousands,

840
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,270
looking for jobs,
for greener grass.

841
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:16,440
Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't
get noticed everywhere he goes.

842
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,609
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

843
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:21,862
He is, uh...

844
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:24,489
...strange, I admit.

845
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:28,660
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

846
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,080
I know violent men,
Mr. Hammersmith.

847
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:34,207
I deal with them
day in and day out.

848
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,127
You didn't come
up here to ask me

849
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,670
whether he might
have killed before.

850
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,047
You came up here to see
if I think he did it at all.

851
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,718
Do you?

852
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,305
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

853
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,515
He was found with
the victims in his arms.

854
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:52,267
And yet you defended him.

855
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,479
Everyone is entitled
to a defense.

856
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,315
Kids! Lunch!

857
01:11:58,398 --> 01:11:59,691
Y'all listen
to your mama now!

858
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,198
I'll tell you something.

859
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,075
And you listen close, too,
because it might be something

860
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,660
you need to know.

861
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,078
I'm listening.

862
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,581
We had us a dog.

863
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:17,709
Just a sweet mongrel.

864
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,294
You know the kind.

865
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:24,090
Well, in many ways, a good
mongrel dog is like a Negro.

866
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,718
You get to know it.

867
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:31,473
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use,

868
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,518
but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

869
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,188
If you're lucky,
Mr. Edgecomb,

870
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,815
you never have to
find out any different.

871
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,193
My wife and I
were not so lucky.

872
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,489
Caleb, come here
for a second.

873
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,158
Come here.

874
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:52,744
Please, Son.

875
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,248
He still has
the one good eye.

876
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,544
I suppose he's lucky

877
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,712
not to be completely blind.

878
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:09,177
We get down on our knees and
thank God for that much at least.

879
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,596
Right, Caleb?

880
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,392
Okay, go on in now.

881
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,565
That dog attacked
my boy for no reason.

882
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,359
Just got it in
his mind one day.

883
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,903
The same with
John Coffey.

884
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:31,157
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

885
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,910
But those little girls...

886
01:13:33,994 --> 01:13:36,162
...stayed raped
and murdered.

887
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,082
Maybe he'd never
done it before.

888
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,836
My dog never bit before.

889
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,382
But I didn't concern
myself with that.

890
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,884
I went out there
with my rifle

891
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:52,512
and grabbed his collar
and blew his brains out.

892
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:54,973
Is Coffey guilty?

893
01:13:57,976 --> 01:13:59,686
Yes, he is.

894
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,187
Don't you doubt it.

895
01:14:02,314 --> 01:14:04,858
And don't you turn
your back on him.

896
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,027
You may get away
with it once

897
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,529
or even a hundred times.

898
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,198
But in the end,

899
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:15,869
you'll get bit.

900
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,884
Oh, me! Oh, my!

901
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,846
John.

902
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,222
John.

903
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,851
I'm smelling me
some corn bread.

904
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,187
It's from my missus.

905
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,318
She wanted to thank you.

906
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:51,112
Thank me for what?

907
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,073
Well, you know.

908
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,951
For helping me.

909
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,245
Helping you with what?

910
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:01,206
You know.

911
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,377
Oh...

912
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,589
Was your missus pleased?

913
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,093
Several times.

914
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:32,112
Oh, John, I can smell that
from over here. I surely can.

915
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:37,283
Can I give Del
and Mr. Jingles some?

916
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,661
Well, it's yours, John.

917
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,496
You can do with it
as you please.

918
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:48,002
Here. This for Del
and Mr. Jingles.

919
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:52,382
Hey! What about me? I'm
gonna get some, too, ain't I?

920
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:57,637
It's yours, John.
As you please.

921
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,974
I think
I'll just keep the rest, then.

922
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,982
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

923
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:13,987
Oh, John, that's so very
fine of you.

924
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,073
I thank you.
Mr. Jingle thank you.

925
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,867
My mama would thank you,
too, but she dead.

926
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:20,744
Welcome.

927
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,871
Hey! What about me?

928
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:26,166
Don't you hold out on me,
you big dummy nigger.

929
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,838
Ooh, here come
the boss man.

930
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:35,175
You'll keep a civil
tongue on my block.

931
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,688
You get that one for free.

932
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,274
But that's the last one.

933
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,067
That's it?

934
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,445
Just that little
itty-bitty one?

935
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:59,073
I guess I'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest, huh?

936
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,087
Yee-haw!

937
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,214
Good shot, weren't it?

938
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,718
The look on your face!

939
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,599
Do you believe this?

940
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,851
That son of a bitch
pissed on me.

941
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:28,937
Did y'all like that?

942
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,106
I'm currently cooking up
some turds to go with it.

943
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:34,025
Nice soft ones.

944
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,861
Have 'em out
to y'all tomorrow.

945
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:40,824
We've been meaning
to clean out that room

946
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:41,991
for a while,
haven't we?

947
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,326
Oh, yeah.

948
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,205
Hey! Hey! Be
careful with that. That's fragile.

949
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:51,876
Hey. Hey! What is it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

950
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,087
Y'all wanna come on in
here and dust a little?

951
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:57,715
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

952
01:18:11,563 --> 01:18:14,023
You can come in here
on your legs,

953
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,526
but you'll go out
on your backs.

954
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,320
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

955
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:23,658
Come on, fuck-stick. No
sneaking up on me this time.

956
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,493
We'll go man-to-man.

957
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,415
Piss on me?

958
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,736
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

959
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,404
Don't you call me that!

960
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,407
Wild Bill Hickok
wasn't no range rider!

961
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,659
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

962
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,703
Dumb son of a bitch sat
with his back to the door,

963
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,746
killed by a drunk.

964
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,540
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

965
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,417
Oh, you just never know
what you're gonna get

966
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,752
when you come to work
every day on the Green Mile.

967
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,673
Thank you, Wild Bill.

968
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,684
Not in there. Not in there. I'll
be good. Fellas, I'll be good.

969
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,978
Honest In jun,
I will. I will.

970
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,361
Christ, he's pitching a fit.

971
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,321
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

972
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,614
One, two, three.

973
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,493
Hey. Hey!

974
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,286
Hey! Hey!

975
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,996
Hey, hey!

976
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:53,957
Hey, fellers.

977
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,210
Hey, it's not funny.
You won't leave...

978
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:03,841
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

979
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,052
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

980
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,771
I... I learned my lesson.

981
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,314
I'll be good.

982
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,452
Psst.

983
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:32,578
Hey, Toot.

984
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,749
Give you a nickel
for that MoonPie.

985
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:15,246
Ooh, ooh.

986
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:17,707
Little Black Sambo! Yo!

987
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,587
Yes,
sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

988
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,340
Hope your bags are packed.

989
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:28,676
My bags are packed!
I'm ready to go!

990
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,678
Where are we going? Let's go!

991
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,097
No! No! No!

992
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:35,058
No! No! No!

993
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:37,351
No! No! No!

994
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:40,688
No! No! No!

995
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:44,025
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

996
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:47,820
That MoonPie thing was pretty
original. Gotta give him that.

997
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,199
Oh, yeah.

998
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:10,134
Del, grab up your things. It's a
big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

999
01:22:10,218 --> 01:22:11,594
What you talking about?

1000
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:15,473
Important folks heard about your
mouse. Wanna see him perform.

1001
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,183
Not just
prison guards either.

1002
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,228
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol I believe.

1003
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,190
You fellas coming?

1004
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,192
No, we got other fish
to fry just now, Del,

1005
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:30,446
but you knock 'em
for a loop, yeah.

1006
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,324
You knock 'em
for a loop, Del.

1007
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,701
Just like Mr. Harry says.

1008
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,924
All right. Let's move briskly,
folks. There's not much time.

1009
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:53,261
All right, rehearsing now!

1010
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,888
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

1011
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:59,600
I been fixing the
plumbing here for 10 years.

1012
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:02,103
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

1013
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,523
Well, you're the VIP
today, Earl, so just shut up.

1014
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:10,278
All right, everybody,
have a seat.

1015
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,545
This is great.

1016
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:34,594
All right.

1017
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,181
Eduard Delacroix,

1018
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:41,017
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

1019
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,270
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

1020
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:47,607
God have mercy
on your soul.

1021
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,867
Roll on two.

1022
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:02,955
That's that.

1023
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:09,128
Very good.
Very professional.

1024
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,758
Let's do it again.

1025
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:17,386
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

1026
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,846
Thank you.
Yep.

1027
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:21,974
It's hard to keep a straight
face when Toot's acting the goat.

1028
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,643
You got that chin
strap good and tight

1029
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,228
because his head
is gonna buck...

1030
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,688
All right, break it up.

1031
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:34,779
So?
Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

1032
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,197
They laugh over there,

1033
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,659
they cheer,
they clap their hands.

1034
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,620
Well, that's just aces.

1035
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:45,206
Isn't that something?

1036
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,832
You done good, old-timer.

1037
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,876
We're happy for you.

1038
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,713
Yeah, we are.

1039
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,225
Boo!

1040
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,648
Percy, you shit.

1041
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:15,653
Come on. Del, get up.

1042
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,323
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

1043
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:22,451
I was just playing.
Come on, now.

1044
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,704
I was just having...

1045
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,666
- Ain't you sweet?
- Wharton.

1046
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,627
- Soft like a girl.
- Let him go.

1047
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:33,713
I'd rather fuck
your asshole,

1048
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,840
than your sister's
pussy, I think.

1049
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,591
Wharton!

1050
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:46,892
I let him go. I was just
playing. I let him go.

1051
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,395
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

1052
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:52,940
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover boy.

1053
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,735
I think you sweet
on old Billy the Kid.

1054
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:00,031
Ooh, but smell you.

1055
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,414
Look.

1056
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:10,166
He done piss his pants.

1057
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,337
Oh, my God.

1058
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,881
Look what
the big man done.

1059
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:20,926
He bust other people with
a stick. Come on, get in.

1060
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,180
Somebody touch him,

1061
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:26,515
he make water in his
pants like a little baby.

1062
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:29,977
Del!

1063
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,604
Learn when to shut up.

1064
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,357
All right, now.

1065
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:37,818
Don't touch me.

1066
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:53,834
You...

1067
01:26:53,918 --> 01:26:56,587
You talk about
this to anyone...

1068
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,215
I'll get you all fired.

1069
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,551
I swear that to God.

1070
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:08,391
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

1071
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:19,360
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

1072
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,904
You just keep on laughin'!

1073
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:28,577
Wetmore a good name for you!

1074
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,789
Percy Wetmore do a dance.

1075
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,208
Listen to him
squishing in his pant.

1076
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:47,888
Well,
what about Dean?

1077
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:49,348
He's got a little boy.

1078
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:51,517
He'd love to have
a pet mouse, I bet.

1079
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:57,523
How could a boy be
trusted with Mr. Jingle?

1080
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,900
Maybe forget to feed him.

1081
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,111
How he keep up
with his training?

1082
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,363
I mean,
he just a boy, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1083
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:06,115
Hmm.

1084
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,709
All right.
I'll take him, then.

1085
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,086
Me.

1086
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:22,006
Thank you kindly, but...

1087
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,843
You live out in the woods.

1088
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,386
Mr. Jingle, he be...

1089
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:31,056
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

1090
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,522
How about Mouseville?

1091
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,691
Mouseville?

1092
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,902
Tourist attraction
down in Florida.

1093
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,863
Tallahassee, I think.

1094
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,240
Is that right, Paul?
Tallahassee? Yeah, yeah.

1095
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:49,950
Tallahassee.

1096
01:28:50,034 --> 01:28:52,912
It's just down the road
a-piece from the dog university.

1097
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:59,835
You think, uh... You think
they'd take Mr. Jingles?

1098
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,546
You think
he's got the stuff?

1099
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:04,590
Well, he is pretty smart.

1100
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:07,635
What is Mouseville?

1101
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,095
Tourist attraction,
I said.

1102
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,847
They got this big
tent you go into.

1103
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:13,557
You have to pay?
What, are you shitting me?

1104
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,518
Of course you pay.

1105
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:18,229
Dime apiece.
Two cents for the kids.

1106
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:19,355
For the kids.

1107
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,524
Inside the tent
they got this, uh...

1108
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,609
Mouse city,

1109
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:26,195
made out of

1110
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,948
old boxes and
toilet paper rolls,

1111
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:30,950
little windows
so you can look in.

1112
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:35,371
Plus, they got the Mouseville
All-Star Circus.

1113
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:39,375
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

1114
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:43,587
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

1115
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:48,801
Yeah, that's it.

1116
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:52,221
That's the place
for Mr. Jingles.

1117
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,058
Oh!

1118
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,812
You gonna be
a circus mouse after all.

1119
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:03,983
You're gonna live in a
mouse city down in Florida.

1120
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:09,280
Oh, there he goes.

1121
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,745
No!

1122
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,123
Mr. Jingles!

1123
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,251
No! No! No!

1124
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,300
You kill my mouse.

1125
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,343
I knew I'd get him
sooner or later.

1126
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:33,929
It was just a matter
of time, really.

1127
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:36,890
You fucking
cruel bastard!

1128
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,443
Give him to me.

1129
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,779
Give him to me.
Might still be time.

1130
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,461
What are you doing?

1131
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:07,713
Paul?

1132
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,674
What the hell?

1133
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:12,092
Please, John.

1134
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:14,970
Help him.

1135
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,931
Please, Johnny, help him.

1136
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,229
Oh, dear Jesus.

1137
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:26,148
The tail.

1138
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,275
Look at the tail.

1139
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:55,446
You're back.

1140
01:32:58,741 --> 01:32:59,992
What did you do?

1141
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:02,536
I helped Del's mouse...

1142
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:04,997
He's a circus mouse.

1143
01:33:05,539 --> 01:33:08,751
Gonna live in
a mouse city down in...

1144
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:12,796
Florida.

1145
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:17,551
Boss, Percy bad.

1146
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,511
He mean.

1147
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:21,180
He step on Del's mouse.

1148
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,850
I took it back, though.

1149
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,685
<i>Merci.</i>

1150
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,859
Brute...

1151
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,903
You come along with me.

1152
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,072
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1153
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,557
Now, don't start in on me.

1154
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:07,935
It was just a mouse.

1155
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,979
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1156
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:12,898
The mouse is fine.

1157
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:15,150
Just fine.

1158
01:34:15,234 --> 01:34:17,236
You're no better at
mouse-killing than you are at...

1159
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,905
Hell, at anything
else around here.

1160
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:24,785
Yeah, you expect me
to believe that? Huh?

1161
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,747
I heard the goddamn
thing crunch.

1162
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,542
Aren't you glad
Mr. Jingles is okay?

1163
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,586
After all those
talks we had about...

1164
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,047
...keeping the prisoners calm?

1165
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,091
Aren't you relieved?

1166
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,093
What kind of game is this?

1167
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,261
It's no game.

1168
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:44,346
See for yourself.

1169
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:48,642
Go on.

1170
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:04,283
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

1171
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,622
You switched him.

1172
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:12,541
You switched him somehow,
you bastards.

1173
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:17,504
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

1174
01:35:17,588 --> 01:35:20,549
Oh, yeah, you playing
with me, huh? Both of you.

1175
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,718
Just who the hell
you think you are, huh?

1176
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:23,802
Ah!

1177
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:27,598
We're the people
you work with, Percy.

1178
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,433
But not for long.

1179
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,060
Percy, I want your word.

1180
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:34,313
My word?

1181
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:37,190
I put you out front for Del...

1182
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,653
...you put in your transfer to
Briar Ridge the very next day.

1183
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,408
Well, what if I just
call up certain people

1184
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:48,327
and tell 'em
you're harassing me?

1185
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,120
Bullying me.

1186
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:51,246
Go ahead.

1187
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:54,875
I promise you'll leave your
share of blood on the floor.

1188
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,418
Over a mouse?

1189
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,502
No!

1190
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,672
But four men will
swear you stood by...

1191
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,133
...while Wild Bill tried
to strangle Dean to death.

1192
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,259
About that, people will care.

1193
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,219
Even your uncle,
the governor...

1194
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,346
...will care about that.

1195
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:09,348
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1196
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:14,353
Work record can follow a man
around for a long, long time.

1197
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:16,396
I put you out front,

1198
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,024
you put in for that transfer.

1199
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:22,361
That's the deal.

1200
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:27,866
All right.

1201
01:36:29,326 --> 01:36:30,410
All right.

1202
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:39,878
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1203
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:43,817
Hey, boys.

1204
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:48,238
No, now, say,
"Hey," Mr. Jingles.

1205
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:53,035
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1206
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:09,301
Boss Edgecomb?

1207
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,303
Yes, Del?

1208
01:38:11,762 --> 01:38:14,139
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1209
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:17,976
Here. You take him.

1210
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,067
Del...

1211
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,988
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1212
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,991
You know.

1213
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,328
I'll take him, boss.

1214
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:39,831
Just for now,
if Del don't mind.

1215
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,044
Yeah.

1216
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,338
Yeah, you take him, John.

1217
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,673
You take him till
this foolishment be done.

1218
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:12,322
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1219
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,908
We'll do it together,
most likely.

1220
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:18,370
Maybe take
a little vacation time.

1221
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,163
Yeah.

1222
01:39:20,247 --> 01:39:22,457
People pay a dime
apiece to see him.

1223
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,168
Two cents for the kids.

1224
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:26,294
Ain't that right,
Boss Howell?

1225
01:39:26,378 --> 01:39:27,712
That's right, Del.

1226
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,008
You're a good man,
Boss Howell.

1227
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,013
You, too, Boss Edgecomb.

1228
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:43,895
I sure wish I could've met
you guys somewheres else.

1229
01:40:23,602 --> 01:40:25,687
Hope he's good and scared.

1230
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,856
Hope he knows
the fires are stoked

1231
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,774
and that Satan's
imps are waiting.

1232
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,203
Del, it's all right.

1233
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:25,580
Roll on one.

1234
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:39,636
You be still,
Mr. Jingles.

1235
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:44,391
You be so quiet and so still.

1236
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,146
Eduard Delacroix,

1237
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:53,566
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers,

1238
01:41:54,109 --> 01:41:57,821
sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1239
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:01,199
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1240
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:11,543
I sorry for what I...

1241
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,719
I sorry for what I do.

1242
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:23,555
I give anything
to take it back.

1243
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,433
But I can't.

1244
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,686
God have mercy on me.

1245
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,689
Amen.

1246
01:42:41,406 --> 01:42:42,991
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1247
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:46,911
Hey,

1248
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,706
there's no such place.

1249
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,626
That's just a fairytale these
guys told you to keep you quiet.

1250
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,507
Just thought
you should know, faggot.

1251
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,029
Eduard Delacroix,

1252
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:06,074
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

1253
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:09,244
until you are dead
in accordance with state law.

1254
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:13,206
God have mercy on your soul.

1255
01:44:52,454 --> 01:44:53,538
Roll on two!

1256
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:11,890
The sponge is dry.

1257
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:13,391
What?

1258
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,857
Jack,
the goddamn sponge is dry!

1259
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,400
Well, don't you stop it!

1260
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:24,319
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1261
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:41,836
Is this normal?

1262
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,088
God, the smell.

1263
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:45,215
Oh.

1264
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,175
He's cooking now!

1265
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:48,468
They cooking him good!

1266
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:50,637
They're about done,
I reckon!

1267
01:45:54,057 --> 01:45:55,266
Yeah!

1268
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:57,435
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1269
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:03,900
Yeah!
He's cooking now!

1270
01:46:05,068 --> 01:46:06,778
He's cooking now!

1271
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:10,865
We gonna have a hoedown!
'Cution gumbo.

1272
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:12,992
Give me some!

1273
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:16,412
Give me some!
I'm smelling gumbo!

1274
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:19,791
I'm smelling...
I said, give me some!

1275
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,505
I smell it!

1276
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,133
I smell it!

1277
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:38,142
Should I kill the juice?

1278
01:46:38,226 --> 01:46:39,811
No!
Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1279
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,296
He's frying now!
He's frying now!

1280
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:08,172
He's frying now!

1281
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:11,092
Why don't you shut it down?

1282
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,468
He's still alive.

1283
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:14,429
You want me to shut down
while he's still alive?

1284
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:23,187
You watch,
you son of a bitch!

1285
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:27,650
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1286
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,070
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm!

1287
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:37,910
Kill it!

1288
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:45,960
You do it!

1289
01:47:46,044 --> 01:47:47,587
You're running
this show, ain't you?

1290
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,493
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1291
01:48:19,577 --> 01:48:20,912
Brutal!

1292
01:48:21,746 --> 01:48:23,164
Brutal, no!

1293
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:24,207
No! No!

1294
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:25,416
What do you mean, "No"?

1295
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,293
How can you say no?
You saw what he did!

1296
01:48:27,377 --> 01:48:28,419
Delacroix's dead!

1297
01:48:28,503 --> 01:48:30,505
Now, there's nothing can change
that and Percy is not worth it!

1298
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,840
So he just gets away with it?
Is that how it works?

1299
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:44,185
What in the blue fuck
was that?

1300
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,522
Jesus Christ.

1301
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:49,732
There's puke all over
the floor up there.

1302
01:48:50,525 --> 01:48:52,026
And the smell.

1303
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,779
I got Van Hay
to open both doors,

1304
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:57,031
but that smell won't go out
for five damn years.

1305
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:58,449
That's what I'm betting.

1306
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:02,370
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1307
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:04,956
You can hear him up there!

1308
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,583
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1309
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:20,596
Okay, boys, okay.

1310
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:24,517
Now,
what in the hell happened?

1311
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:25,977
An execution.

1312
01:49:26,561 --> 01:49:27,854
A successful one.

1313
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:32,150
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1314
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:35,236
Eduard Delacroix is dead...

1315
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,156
Isn't he?

1316
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,495
Percy?
Yeah.

1317
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:46,497
Something to say?

1318
01:49:50,418 --> 01:49:52,920
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1319
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:57,008
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat

1320
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,010
before someone
told you to put it up?

1321
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:00,887
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1322
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,805
Pure and simple.

1323
01:50:03,598 --> 01:50:05,641
That's your
official position?

1324
01:50:05,725 --> 01:50:07,101
Don't you think
it should be?

1325
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:11,147
He's putting in for a transfer
request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1326
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:14,150
Moving on to bigger
and better things.

1327
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,194
Isn't that right, Percy?

1328
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,530
Yeah. Yeah.

1329
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:22,867
<i>Barbecue, me and you</i>

1330
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,703
<i>Stinky, pinky
Phew, phew, phew</i>

1331
01:50:26,162 --> 01:50:29,290
<i>Weren't Billy,
Jilly, Hilly or Pa</i>

1332
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:32,794
<i>It was a French-fried
Cajun named Delacroix</i>

1333
01:50:32,877 --> 01:50:33,961
Whoo!

1334
01:50:34,045 --> 01:50:37,507
<i>Barbecue, me and you</i>

1335
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:40,802
<i>Stinky, pinky
Phew, phew, phew</i>

1336
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:42,637
<i>Weren't Billy, Jilly...</i>

1337
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,431
You're about 10 seconds
away from spending

1338
01:50:45,515 --> 01:50:47,558
the rest of your life
in the padded room.

1339
01:51:06,244 --> 01:51:07,370
Poor old Del.

1340
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:10,122
Yeah.

1341
01:51:11,082 --> 01:51:12,583
Poor old Del.

1342
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:16,170
John?

1343
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:20,091
You okay?

1344
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:23,594
I could feel it from here.

1345
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,055
What do you mean?

1346
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:27,890
You could hear it.

1347
01:51:28,558 --> 01:51:29,851
Is that what you mean?

1348
01:51:29,934 --> 01:51:30,935
You could hear it.

1349
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,770
He out of it now, though.

1350
01:51:33,855 --> 01:51:35,147
He the lucky one.

1351
01:51:36,232 --> 01:51:38,234
No matter how it happened,

1352
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:39,986
Del the lucky one.

1353
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:48,369
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1354
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:51,873
He run away under that door.

1355
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:55,626
Don't think he'll be back.

1356
01:51:57,253 --> 01:51:59,672
He felt it too, through me.

1357
01:52:01,257 --> 01:52:03,467
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1358
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:06,512
All that hurt just spill out.

1359
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:15,605
Awful tired now, boss.

1360
01:52:17,857 --> 01:52:19,191
Dog-tired.

1361
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:27,199
Me too, John.

1362
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,870
Me, too.

1363
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:32,390
I hate this.

1364
01:53:33,349 --> 01:53:34,558
I know.

1365
01:53:49,615 --> 01:53:52,076
Melinda, hi.

1366
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,582
I am so happy to see you.
Oh.

1367
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,419
Look at you.

1368
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:04,672
Well, we missed you
at church.

1369
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:08,509
Oh!

1370
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:10,469
Ah, my hair...

1371
01:54:11,137 --> 01:54:12,221
You look fine.

1372
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:13,931
I'm just a mess.

1373
01:54:19,395 --> 01:54:21,814
She's having one
of her good days.

1374
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,233
I thank God for that.

1375
01:54:26,694 --> 01:54:28,320
What's a bad day?

1376
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:33,617
Sometimes she's...

1377
01:54:35,161 --> 01:54:36,579
She's not herself anymore.

1378
01:54:37,163 --> 01:54:38,539
She swears.

1379
01:54:38,998 --> 01:54:40,374
She swears?

1380
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:42,084
It just pops out.

1381
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:44,920
Most awful language
you can imagine.

1382
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:47,715
She doesn't even
know she's doing it.

1383
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:51,427
I didn't know she'd
ever heard words like that.

1384
01:54:52,303 --> 01:54:55,056
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice.

1385
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:01,645
I'm glad she's
having a good day, Paul.

1386
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:05,483
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1387
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,167
Honey,

1388
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,003
if you don't tell me
what's on your mind,

1389
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,215
I'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1390
01:55:38,891 --> 01:55:40,684
I'm thinking I love you.

1391
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:45,689
I'm thinking I don't know what
I would do if you were gone.

1392
01:55:48,526 --> 01:55:49,527
Oh.

1393
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:55,699
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1394
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,998
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1395
01:56:03,082 --> 01:56:04,542
Well, thank you.

1396
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:07,419
This is one delicious treat,
ma'am, before I go to work.

1397
01:56:07,503 --> 01:56:09,046
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

1398
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:10,673
Hey, Brutal.
Hmm.

1399
01:56:10,756 --> 01:56:11,966
You gonna hog
all them taters?

1400
01:56:12,049 --> 01:56:13,217
Yes, I am.

1401
01:56:13,968 --> 01:56:15,845
Harry, you want some taters?
Come on, now.

1402
01:56:16,137 --> 01:56:17,138
What?

1403
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:20,015
Very soon we'll just see
your feet sticking out of there, Brutus.

1404
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:21,600
Y'all saw what
he did to the mouse.

1405
01:56:25,396 --> 01:56:27,690
I could've gone the rest of the
day without you bringing that up.

1406
01:56:27,773 --> 01:56:29,441
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1407
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:31,569
He did the same thing to me.

1408
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:33,904
He put his hands on me.

1409
01:56:35,239 --> 01:56:36,949
He took my
bladder infection away.

1410
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:45,249
It's true. When he came
home that day, he was...

1411
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:48,711
...all better.

1412
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,173
Oh, now, wait.
You're talking about...

1413
01:56:52,256 --> 01:56:54,258
...an authentic healing?

1414
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,720
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1415
01:56:58,637 --> 01:56:59,680
I am.

1416
01:57:00,556 --> 01:57:01,640
Oh, yeah.

1417
01:57:02,183 --> 01:57:04,643
Well, if you say it,
I accept it.

1418
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:07,521
What's it got
to do with us?

1419
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:09,857
You're thinking about Melinda.

1420
01:57:10,316 --> 01:57:11,400
Melinda?

1421
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,652
Melinda Moores?

1422
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,070
Yeah. So, Paul,

1423
01:57:15,154 --> 01:57:16,906
you really think
you can help her?

1424
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:19,283
It's not a bladder infection

1425
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,535
or even a busted mouse,

1426
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:24,079
but I think there
might be a chance.

1427
01:57:24,455 --> 01:57:25,915
Hold on now.

1428
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:28,042
You're talking about our jobs.

1429
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,377
Sneak a sick woman
into a cell block?

1430
01:57:30,461 --> 01:57:32,546
Oh, no. No, no. Hal would
never stand for that.

1431
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:36,217
You know him. He wouldn't
believe anything if it fell on him.

1432
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,551
So you're talking about

1433
01:57:38,469 --> 01:57:39,929
taking John Coffey to her.

1434
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:47,686
That's more than
just our jobs, Paul.

1435
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:50,564
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1436
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:51,941
You're dang right, it is.

1437
01:57:52,024 --> 01:57:53,901
No,
not for you, Dean.

1438
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:57,238
See now, the way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1439
01:57:57,321 --> 01:57:58,822
That way,
you can deny everything.

1440
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:01,158
Why do I have to stay behind?

1441
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,828
Well, our boy's grown up,

1442
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:06,997
gone off to school.

1443
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:09,166
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1444
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,085
Brutal's a single man.

1445
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:14,421
You're the only one here with two
children, another one on the way.

1446
01:58:15,256 --> 01:58:18,175
Let's not discuss this as
if we're thinking of doing it.

1447
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,846
Brutal, help me out here.

1448
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,600
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1449
01:58:26,684 --> 01:58:28,102
The finest.

1450
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:30,646
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1451
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:33,232
To the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1452
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:34,900
I have no doubt.

1453
01:58:36,485 --> 01:58:38,529
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do, do we?

1454
01:58:38,862 --> 01:58:41,657
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1455
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:44,702
Now, what if he escapes?

1456
01:58:45,286 --> 01:58:48,205
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison,

1457
01:58:48,872 --> 01:58:52,126
but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1458
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:53,502
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1459
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,089
In fact,

1460
01:58:59,675 --> 01:59:01,343
I don't think
he did it at all.

1461
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,181
I do not see God

1462
01:59:06,724 --> 01:59:10,686
putting a gift like that in the
hands of a man who'd kill a child.

1463
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,646
Well, that's a very
tender notion,

1464
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:15,274
but the man is on
death row for the crime.

1465
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:18,402
And plus,

1466
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:20,487
he's huge.

1467
01:59:20,988 --> 01:59:22,614
If he tried to get away,

1468
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:25,701
it'd take a lot of
bullets to stop him.

1469
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:27,703
Oh, we'd all have shotguns,

1470
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:29,580
in addition to side arms.

1471
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:31,832
I'd insist on that.

1472
01:59:33,125 --> 01:59:35,919
If he tried anything,
anything at all,

1473
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:37,963
we'd have to take him down.

1474
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:40,090
You understand?

1475
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:53,103
So...

1476
01:59:54,021 --> 01:59:55,272
Tell us what you had in mind.

1477
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:05,032
- Oh, there it is.
- Oh, I see it.

1478
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,128
You think this is enough?

1479
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:21,131
I don't know.

1480
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,795
You fellas thirsty?

1481
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,588
Fresh out of the icebox.

1482
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,966
You bet. That's swell,
Brutal. Thanks.

1483
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:05,384
Oh, yeah.

1484
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:07,761
Hot in here.
Boy, howdy.

1485
02:01:07,845 --> 02:01:10,764
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some, too, ain't I?

1486
02:01:11,223 --> 02:01:12,933
My ass,
you get some, too.

1487
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:14,601
What makes you think
you deserve any?

1488
02:01:15,436 --> 02:01:17,187
Because I got a big pecker.

1489
02:01:17,813 --> 02:01:20,190
Well, the day report
says he's been okay.

1490
02:01:20,983 --> 02:01:23,527
Hell, yeah, I
been behaved. Come on, now.

1491
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:25,362
Don't be stingy hogs.

1492
02:01:28,574 --> 02:01:29,700
Come on.

1493
02:01:30,534 --> 02:01:32,786
Come on.
Come on now, fellers.

1494
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:35,581
Come on, boss.

1495
02:01:35,956 --> 02:01:37,708
I been good all day.

1496
02:01:40,878 --> 02:01:42,296
It's hot in here.

1497
02:01:42,838 --> 02:01:45,924
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1498
02:01:46,467 --> 02:01:48,218
Why don't you
give me some?

1499
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,351
Come on.

1500
02:02:01,648 --> 02:02:02,774
You gonna stay behaved?

1501
02:02:03,692 --> 02:02:05,235
Come on, you clunk,
give me that.

1502
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:06,737
You promise me,

1503
02:02:07,571 --> 02:02:09,448
or I'll drink this myself
right here in front of you.

1504
02:02:09,907 --> 02:02:12,367
Don't, don't, don't... Come
on, now. Don't be that way.

1505
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,244
I'll be good.

1506
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:40,521
Cup.

1507
02:03:31,363 --> 02:03:33,490
Anybody wants out,
now's the time.

1508
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:36,076
After this,
there's no turning back.

1509
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:38,912
So?

1510
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,582
We gonna do this?

1511
02:03:41,665 --> 02:03:44,418
Sure.
That'd be just fine.

1512
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:46,503
I'd like to take a ride.

1513
02:03:52,301 --> 02:03:53,802
Guess we're all in.

1514
02:04:05,564 --> 02:04:06,690
What is this?

1515
02:04:09,151 --> 02:04:10,193
Payback.

1516
02:04:10,527 --> 02:04:11,612
That's right.

1517
02:04:16,617 --> 02:04:17,993
No, you let me go!

1518
02:04:18,076 --> 02:04:19,494
Let go of me!
Settle down.

1519
02:04:19,578 --> 02:04:20,787
Let go!
Settle down.

1520
02:04:20,871 --> 02:04:22,539
What are you doing?
Settle down.

1521
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:30,839
Oh!

1522
02:04:31,423 --> 02:04:32,549
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1523
02:04:32,633 --> 02:04:34,259
Oh, Percy.

1524
02:04:34,343 --> 02:04:35,469
What would your mother say?

1525
02:04:35,552 --> 02:04:37,721
You let go of me,
you ignoramus.

1526
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:40,641
I know people. Big people!

1527
02:04:41,058 --> 02:04:43,769
Percy, stick out your
arms like a good lad.

1528
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:46,521
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1529
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:48,398
Oh, you're dead wrong
about that, you know.

1530
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:57,115
You gonna put your arms up, huh?

1531
02:04:57,908 --> 02:04:59,868
A big man is ripping
your ears off, Percy.

1532
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,119
I'd do as he says.

1533
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:04,498
There you go.

1534
02:05:13,215 --> 02:05:14,383
Please, Paul.

1535
02:05:14,883 --> 02:05:17,010
Please don't put me
in with Wild Bill.

1536
02:05:17,094 --> 02:05:18,553
Please don't.

1537
02:05:19,763 --> 02:05:21,098
You would think that.

1538
02:05:23,558 --> 02:05:26,019
No, no, no,
you can't do this to me.

1539
02:05:26,103 --> 02:05:28,605
You can't do this to me.
You can't.

1540
02:05:29,106 --> 02:05:31,191
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1541
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:33,443
We can and we are.

1542
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:42,786
We'll give you a few hours
of quiet time, Percy,

1543
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:45,914
so you can reflect
on what you did to Del.

1544
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:49,126
And if you get lonely, just
think about Miss Leadpipe.

1545
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,887
All right, let's go
over it one more time.

1546
02:06:00,971 --> 02:06:02,639
What do you say
if somebody stops by?

1547
02:06:04,933 --> 02:06:06,601
Coffey got upset
just after lights out,

1548
02:06:06,685 --> 02:06:09,479
so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1549
02:06:10,397 --> 02:06:12,357
They hear any kicking and
fussing, they'll think it's him.

1550
02:06:12,441 --> 02:06:13,525
What about me?

1551
02:06:13,608 --> 02:06:15,402
You're down in Admin
pulling Del's file,

1552
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:16,903
going over the witnesses
on account of

1553
02:06:16,987 --> 02:06:19,531
how big a screw up
the execution was.

1554
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:23,660
We going for the ride now?

1555
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,704
That's right.
We going for the ride.

1556
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,208
What about us, Dean?

1557
02:06:30,292 --> 02:06:34,171
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1558
02:06:34,254 --> 02:06:36,006
Take you'll a few hours
before you're back.

1559
02:06:40,385 --> 02:06:41,803
Where you think you going?

1560
02:06:48,852 --> 02:06:50,353
You a bad man.

1561
02:06:50,687 --> 02:06:52,939
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1562
02:07:00,697 --> 02:07:02,616
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1563
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:03,909
What's wrong?

1564
02:07:28,266 --> 02:07:30,811
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1565
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:33,563
It's like
I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1566
02:07:34,105 --> 02:07:36,024
Had me some shine or...

1567
02:07:37,234 --> 02:07:38,485
Or what?

1568
02:07:40,946 --> 02:07:43,740
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1569
02:07:43,824 --> 02:07:45,033
White man...

1570
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,203
...ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair.

1571
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,247
No, sir.

1572
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:59,548
He a bad man.

1573
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:20,819
Look, boss.

1574
02:08:25,365 --> 02:08:27,617
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1575
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:30,579
Shh! John,
we have to be quiet now.

1576
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:33,540
You see her?
You see the lady?

1577
02:08:33,623 --> 02:08:35,876
Yeah, we see her,
John. Come on.

1578
02:08:47,387 --> 02:08:49,306
Let's go. Go, go!

1579
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:54,769
Now!

1580
02:09:30,764 --> 02:09:32,849
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1581
02:10:07,384 --> 02:10:09,511
Upsy-daisy.

1582
02:10:17,018 --> 02:10:18,103
John,

1583
02:10:18,687 --> 02:10:20,230
do you know where
we're taking you tonight?

1584
02:10:24,025 --> 02:10:25,193
Help a lady?

1585
02:10:27,404 --> 02:10:28,571
That's right.

1586
02:10:29,823 --> 02:10:30,865
But how do you know?

1587
02:10:32,659 --> 02:10:34,035
Don't know.

1588
02:10:35,954 --> 02:10:37,122
Tell the truth, boss,

1589
02:10:38,081 --> 02:10:39,708
I don't know
much of anything.

1590
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:43,044
I never have.

1591
02:11:18,329 --> 02:11:19,914
We can still turn back.

1592
02:11:22,167 --> 02:11:24,878
Boss, look.
Someone's up.

1593
02:11:27,005 --> 02:11:28,423
This was a mistake.

1594
02:11:29,299 --> 02:11:31,384
Oh, Christ, Paul,
what were we thinking?

1595
02:11:31,468 --> 02:11:33,928
It's too late now.
John, you stay.

1596
02:11:38,975 --> 02:11:41,519
Harry, you keep John
here till we call you.

1597
02:11:52,155 --> 02:11:54,824
Who the hell goes there at
2:30 in the goddamn morning?

1598
02:11:54,908 --> 02:11:56,993
Hal, it's us.
It's Paul and Brutal.

1599
02:11:57,327 --> 02:11:58,703
It's us.
Jesus.

1600
02:11:59,162 --> 02:12:01,623
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1601
02:12:01,706 --> 02:12:03,541
No.
Hal, for God's sakes,

1602
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:05,210
just take your finger
off the trigger.

1603
02:12:05,293 --> 02:12:06,377
Are you hostages?

1604
02:12:07,587 --> 02:12:09,255
Who's out there?

1605
02:12:09,339 --> 02:12:10,423
Who's by that truck?

1606
02:12:10,507 --> 02:12:11,508
Harry, the lights!

1607
02:12:15,762 --> 02:12:17,180
John Coffey.

1608
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:19,432
- Halt!
- Hal.

1609
02:12:19,516 --> 02:12:20,850
You stay
right where you are!

1610
02:12:20,934 --> 02:12:22,227
Relax, now.
Take it easy, now.

1611
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:23,770
Don't you move!
Wait!

1612
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:25,105
I'm warning you.
John, wait!

1613
02:12:25,188 --> 02:12:27,190
Hal, listen! Halt
right there or I'll shoot!

1614
02:12:27,315 --> 02:12:28,983
I said, halt! PAUL:
Hal, put the gun down!

1615
02:12:29,067 --> 02:12:30,235
Halt!
Hal.

1616
02:12:30,318 --> 02:12:31,528
Hal!

1617
02:12:33,571 --> 02:12:34,656
Hal!

1618
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:37,200
Who you talking
to down there?

1619
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:39,119
God damn it!

1620
02:12:39,202 --> 02:12:41,204
Hal, now,
nobody is hurt.

1621
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:43,623
And we are here to help.

1622
02:12:43,706 --> 02:12:45,041
Help what?

1623
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:47,001
I don't understand.

1624
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:49,587
You're just gonna have to
trust me.

1625
02:13:06,604 --> 02:13:07,730
What do you want?

1626
02:13:08,189 --> 02:13:09,649
Hal!

1627
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,735
Make them go away!

1628
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:16,406
I don't want
no salesmen

1629
02:13:17,157 --> 02:13:19,242
in the middle
of the night.

1630
02:13:20,076 --> 02:13:23,997
Tell them to take
a flying fuck at a rolling...

1631
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,373
Just to help.

1632
02:13:25,999 --> 02:13:28,376
Just to help, boss.
That's all.

1633
02:13:29,544 --> 02:13:30,879
You can't.

1634
02:13:31,546 --> 02:13:32,714
No one can.

1635
02:13:44,184 --> 02:13:45,476
Stay out of here!

1636
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:46,686
Don't you go in there!

1637
02:13:46,895 --> 02:13:49,772
Whoever you are,
just stay out! - Don't you do it!

1638
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:52,775
I'm not
dressed for visitors.

1639
02:13:54,694 --> 02:13:57,071
You stop now.
You hear me?

1640
02:13:57,822 --> 02:13:59,532
Paul, I don't
want him up there.

1641
02:13:59,616 --> 02:14:02,368
Boss, you just
be quiet now.

1642
02:14:50,959 --> 02:14:53,419
It's all right, Hal.
It's all right.

1643
02:14:53,503 --> 02:14:55,755
Hal, watch.
Just watch him.

1644
02:15:02,136 --> 02:15:04,681
Don't come near me,
pig fucker.

1645
02:15:18,695 --> 02:15:21,531
Why do you have so many scars?

1646
02:15:23,825 --> 02:15:26,536
Who hurt you so badly, huh?

1647
02:15:27,662 --> 02:15:29,872
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1648
02:15:32,542 --> 02:15:34,502
What's your name, huh?

1649
02:15:34,585 --> 02:15:36,296
John Coffey, ma'am.

1650
02:15:36,379 --> 02:15:37,714
Like the drink.

1651
02:15:38,298 --> 02:15:40,258
Only not spelt the same.

1652
02:15:47,307 --> 02:15:48,474
Ma'am?

1653
02:15:56,232 --> 02:15:58,401
Yes, John Coffey?

1654
02:15:59,986 --> 02:16:01,237
I see it.

1655
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:03,531
I see it.

1656
02:16:10,705 --> 02:16:12,957
What's happening?

1657
02:16:14,125 --> 02:16:19,255
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1658
02:17:45,633 --> 02:17:47,969
Come on, John.
Sick it up.

1659
02:17:48,052 --> 02:17:50,513
Come on. Cough
it out like you done before.

1660
02:17:52,098 --> 02:17:54,725
He's choking. Whatever
he sucked out of her,

1661
02:17:54,809 --> 02:17:55,852
he's choking on it.

1662
02:17:56,436 --> 02:17:57,520
John.

1663
02:17:59,188 --> 02:18:01,732
I'll be fine.
Just let me be.

1664
02:18:15,329 --> 02:18:16,622
How did I get here?

1665
02:18:19,417 --> 02:18:24,213
We... We were going
to the hospital in Vicksburg.

1666
02:18:24,714 --> 02:18:25,756
Remember?

1667
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,050
Shh... Melly.

1668
02:18:28,926 --> 02:18:31,471
It doesn't matter.

1669
02:18:31,554 --> 02:18:33,222
It doesn't matter anymore.

1670
02:18:33,306 --> 02:18:35,099
Did I have the X-ray?

1671
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:37,560
Did I?

1672
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:42,064
Yes.

1673
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,568
Yes. It was clear.

1674
02:18:45,651 --> 02:18:46,903
There was no tumor.

1675
02:18:51,741 --> 02:18:52,783
Oh.

1676
02:18:54,076 --> 02:18:55,745
Hal.

1677
02:19:02,877 --> 02:19:05,796
John, can you stand up?

1678
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:08,090
Can you turn around
and see this lady?

1679
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:22,188
What's your name?

1680
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,274
John Coffey, ma'am.

1681
02:19:26,984 --> 02:19:28,528
Like the drink.

1682
02:19:30,154 --> 02:19:32,114
Only not spelt the same.

1683
02:19:32,657 --> 02:19:35,910
No, ma'am,
not spelt the same at all.

1684
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:42,083
Melly. No, you can't.

1685
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,943
I dreamed of you.

1686
02:20:12,196 --> 02:20:14,991
I dreamed you were
wandering in the dark.

1687
02:20:16,492 --> 02:20:17,952
And so was I.

1688
02:20:20,162 --> 02:20:22,331
And we found each other.

1689
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,960
We found each other
in the dark.

1690
02:20:45,563 --> 02:20:47,189
Take it, John.
It's a present.

1691
02:20:47,732 --> 02:20:49,525
It's St. Christopher.

1692
02:20:51,027 --> 02:20:53,112
I want you to have it,
Mr. Coffey.

1693
02:20:54,155 --> 02:20:56,198
And wear it.
He'll keep you safe.

1694
02:20:57,033 --> 02:21:00,202
Please. Wear it for me.

1695
02:21:15,593 --> 02:21:16,886
Thank you, ma'am.

1696
02:21:18,929 --> 02:21:20,556
Thank you, John.

1697
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:29,649
Christ, he goes down,

1698
02:21:29,732 --> 02:21:32,360
it'll take three mules and a
crane to pick him up again.

1699
02:21:32,443 --> 02:21:34,487
Take it easy, John.
Come on, now.

1700
02:21:34,570 --> 02:21:35,738
You gotta stay
on your feet.

1701
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:54,548
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1702
02:21:55,466 --> 02:21:57,677
He swallowed that
stuff for a reason.

1703
02:21:58,386 --> 02:22:00,805
I give him a few days.

1704
02:22:00,888 --> 02:22:03,516
One of us will be doing a
cell check, and there he'll be,

1705
02:22:03,599 --> 02:22:04,642
dead on his bunk.

1706
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:07,269
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1707
02:22:07,353 --> 02:22:09,271
Let's just get him
back on the Mile.

1708
02:22:23,452 --> 02:22:25,287
Oh, boy, am I happy
to see you fellows.

1709
02:22:25,371 --> 02:22:28,541
You were gone so long, Wild Bill's
making noise like he's gonna wake up.

1710
02:22:28,624 --> 02:22:29,625
What the hell
happened to him?

1711
02:22:29,959 --> 02:22:32,545
He's hurting, Dean.
He's hurting bad.

1712
02:22:36,465 --> 02:22:38,384
Okay, John.

1713
02:22:38,467 --> 02:22:41,929
We gonna set you
down on your bed now.

1714
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:43,389
Here we go.

1715
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,616
Well?

1716
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:06,537
What about Mrs. Moores?

1717
02:23:08,664 --> 02:23:10,541
Was it like the mouse?

1718
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:13,043
Was it...

1719
02:23:15,004 --> 02:23:17,423
You know, a miracle?

1720
02:23:18,007 --> 02:23:19,216
Yes.

1721
02:23:20,593 --> 02:23:22,344
Yes, it was.

1722
02:23:23,387 --> 02:23:24,555
Damn.

1723
02:23:40,196 --> 02:23:41,447
Now,

1724
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:44,909
I want to talk,
not shout.

1725
02:23:44,992 --> 02:23:47,703
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1726
02:23:47,787 --> 02:23:49,038
Mmm-hmm.

1727
02:23:50,706 --> 02:23:53,542
My mother always says you
do it fast, it won't hurt so much.

1728
02:23:57,338 --> 02:23:59,089
Guess she was wrong.

1729
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:03,928
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1730
02:24:04,011 --> 02:24:06,305
In a minute.
Now! Right now!

1731
02:24:06,388 --> 02:24:08,933
I want out now...

1732
02:24:11,894 --> 02:24:13,646
Shut up and listen.

1733
02:24:14,897 --> 02:24:17,233
Now you deserved to be
punished for what you did to Del.

1734
02:24:17,316 --> 02:24:18,484
You accept it like a man.

1735
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:21,445
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1736
02:24:22,321 --> 02:24:25,491
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1737
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:26,867
Sabotaged?

1738
02:24:26,951 --> 02:24:28,869
...how you pissed yourself
like a frightened little girl.

1739
02:24:28,953 --> 02:24:31,163
Ooh, yes. Yeah, we will talk.

1740
02:24:32,414 --> 02:24:33,916
But, Percy,

1741
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:36,043
you mind me, now.

1742
02:24:37,086 --> 02:24:40,506
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1743
02:24:42,591 --> 02:24:43,801
We know people, too.

1744
02:24:45,427 --> 02:24:47,596
Are you so foolish
you don't realize that?

1745
02:24:50,099 --> 02:24:52,935
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

1746
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:57,189
Nothing's hurt so far
but your pride.

1747
02:24:57,273 --> 02:24:58,524
No one ever need
know about that,

1748
02:24:58,607 --> 02:25:01,443
except the people
in this little room.

1749
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:04,780
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1750
02:25:06,365 --> 02:25:07,741
Always has.

1751
02:25:12,246 --> 02:25:13,622
Hmm.

1752
02:25:17,042 --> 02:25:19,461
May I be let out
of this coat now?

1753
02:25:39,398 --> 02:25:40,482
My things?

1754
02:25:43,736 --> 02:25:45,529
Think it over, Percy.

1755
02:25:46,655 --> 02:25:48,240
Oh, I intend to.

1756
02:25:49,408 --> 02:25:52,286
I intend to think
it over very hard.

1757
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:55,789
Starting right now.

1758
02:26:05,674 --> 02:26:08,844
He'll talk.
Sooner or later.

1759
02:26:09,345 --> 02:26:10,387
Hmm.

1760
02:26:23,442 --> 02:26:24,652
Hey, let him go!

1761
02:26:24,735 --> 02:26:25,778
John, let go!

1762
02:26:25,861 --> 02:26:26,862
Let go, John!

1763
02:26:26,946 --> 02:26:28,697
John, God damn it! Let him go!

1764
02:26:28,781 --> 02:26:29,949
Let go, John! No!

1765
02:26:31,367 --> 02:26:32,910
Back off!

1766
02:26:33,869 --> 02:26:36,413
John, stop it!
Stop it, John!

1767
02:26:36,497 --> 02:26:38,582
Let him go! Back off!
John, let him go!

1768
02:27:39,435 --> 02:27:41,937
Easy, now. Easy.

1769
02:27:43,731 --> 02:27:45,065
Easy. Hey.

1770
02:27:46,233 --> 02:27:47,276
Hey.

1771
02:27:51,363 --> 02:27:52,531
Percy.

1772
02:27:55,659 --> 02:27:57,327
Are you all right?

1773
02:28:29,985 --> 02:28:31,653
Boy, what you looking at?

1774
02:28:39,787 --> 02:28:40,996
What you looking at?

1775
02:28:41,747 --> 02:28:43,499
You limp noodle.

1776
02:28:43,916 --> 02:28:45,793
You wanna kiss my ass?

1777
02:28:46,627 --> 02:28:48,003
You wanna suck my dick?

1778
02:29:00,099 --> 02:29:01,225
No!

1779
02:29:09,233 --> 02:29:11,318
Grab the gun!
Dean, grab the gun!

1780
02:29:17,699 --> 02:29:18,784
Oh, no.

1781
02:29:19,827 --> 02:29:21,495
No, no, no.

1782
02:29:22,246 --> 02:29:23,914
Oh, no.

1783
02:30:14,131 --> 02:30:16,341
I punished them bad men.

1784
02:30:17,134 --> 02:30:18,802
I punished them both.

1785
02:30:19,178 --> 02:30:20,429
Why?

1786
02:30:21,388 --> 02:30:22,472
Why Wild Bill?

1787
02:30:23,932 --> 02:30:27,436
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1788
02:30:29,104 --> 02:30:30,856
I saw what Wild Billy done.

1789
02:30:31,773 --> 02:30:33,525
Saw it plain as day.

1790
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:37,613
You can't hide
what's in your heart.

1791
02:30:38,155 --> 02:30:39,323
What?

1792
02:30:41,074 --> 02:30:42,409
You saw what?

1793
02:30:46,413 --> 02:30:48,123
Take my hand, boss.

1794
02:30:51,627 --> 02:30:53,086
You see for yourself.

1795
02:30:55,172 --> 02:30:57,758
Paul, no.

1796
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:03,472
Please.

1797
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,982
No, no, no.

1798
02:31:14,316 --> 02:31:15,275
Please.

1799
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:17,653
I gots to, boss.

1800
02:31:17,736 --> 02:31:20,239
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1801
02:31:21,949 --> 02:31:22,908
A gift.

1802
02:31:24,785 --> 02:31:28,747
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1803
02:31:50,686 --> 02:31:53,230
Hot cross buns with warm milk.

1804
02:32:22,884 --> 02:32:24,177
Klaus!

1805
02:32:26,722 --> 02:32:29,850
Suppertime!
Bring the girls.

1806
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:36,398
Girls! You heard your mama!

1807
02:32:37,733 --> 02:32:40,319
Yes, Papa!
We're coming!

1808
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:01,965
Come on, Billy. I worked
you enough for one day.

1809
02:33:02,758 --> 02:33:04,760
Come get you some supper.

1810
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:11,808
God is great, God
is good, and we thank you...

1811
02:33:36,166 --> 02:33:37,959
<i>You love your sister?</i>

1812
02:33:38,043 --> 02:33:40,295
<i>You make any noise,
you know what happens?</i>

1813
02:33:40,921 --> 02:33:43,340
I'm gonna kill her
instead of you.

1814
02:33:43,423 --> 02:33:45,634
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her.

1815
02:33:45,717 --> 02:33:46,885
You understand?

1816
02:33:46,968 --> 02:33:48,470
You understand?

1817
02:33:49,096 --> 02:33:50,597
Shh...

1818
02:34:07,155 --> 02:34:10,992
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1819
02:34:12,536 --> 02:34:14,413
Now you see how it is.

1820
02:34:16,039 --> 02:34:18,333
That's the way
it is every day.

1821
02:34:19,251 --> 02:34:23,004
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1822
02:34:33,598 --> 02:34:35,392
- Percy.
- Percy Wetmore.

1823
02:34:35,475 --> 02:34:36,893
Percy.

1824
02:34:36,977 --> 02:34:40,021
Son?
Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1825
02:34:41,189 --> 02:34:42,232
Son?

1826
02:34:42,983 --> 02:34:44,609
Son, can you hear me?

1827
02:34:44,693 --> 02:34:45,986
Speak up
if you can hear us.

1828
02:34:46,987 --> 02:34:49,739
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1829
02:34:51,867 --> 02:34:55,036
Percy, I got to
ask you a few questions.

1830
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:58,331
That's right. One minute,
he was fine, and the next, blammo.

1831
02:34:58,415 --> 02:35:00,834
Dirty bastard grabbed
him through the bars few days back.

1832
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:02,919
Scared the boy so bad,
he wet hisself.

1833
02:35:04,588 --> 02:35:07,340
See, we didn't even...
We didn't see it happen.

1834
02:35:11,553 --> 02:35:16,641
I'll cover for you as much as
I can, even if it means my job.

1835
02:35:17,893 --> 02:35:19,644
But I have to know,

1836
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:21,313
does this have
anything to do

1837
02:35:21,396 --> 02:35:23,148
with what happened
at my house?

1838
02:35:26,318 --> 02:35:27,819
Does it, Paul?

1839
02:35:29,863 --> 02:35:30,906
No.

1840
02:36:58,493 --> 02:36:59,661
Does Hal know?

1841
02:37:00,245 --> 02:37:02,330
That Coffey's innocent,
I mean.

1842
02:37:03,582 --> 02:37:05,250
Well, can he help?

1843
02:37:05,834 --> 02:37:08,461
Does he have the influence
to do something about this?

1844
02:37:09,004 --> 02:37:10,422
Stop the execution?

1845
02:37:10,505 --> 02:37:11,506
No.

1846
02:37:14,843 --> 02:37:16,761
Then don't tell him.

1847
02:37:16,845 --> 02:37:18,930
If it can't help,
don't tell him.

1848
02:37:19,598 --> 02:37:20,682
Ever.

1849
02:37:23,059 --> 02:37:24,644
I won't.

1850
02:37:36,239 --> 02:37:38,617
There's no way out of
this for you, is there?

1851
02:37:40,410 --> 02:37:41,453
No.

1852
02:37:42,537 --> 02:37:45,123
And I've been thinking
about it, believe me.

1853
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:48,418
I've been running it through
my head any number of ways.

1854
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,003
No.

1855
02:37:51,254 --> 02:37:52,964
I'll tell you the truth,
honey.

1856
02:37:54,883 --> 02:37:59,054
I've done some things in my
life that I am not proud of,

1857
02:38:00,221 --> 02:38:04,392
but this is the first time I've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1858
02:38:06,311 --> 02:38:07,395
Hell?

1859
02:38:09,147 --> 02:38:10,565
Oh, Paul.

1860
02:38:13,318 --> 02:38:14,736
Talk to him.

1861
02:38:16,154 --> 02:38:17,614
Talk to John.

1862
02:38:19,783 --> 02:38:21,701
Find out what he wants.

1863
02:38:38,718 --> 02:38:39,761
Hello, boss.

1864
02:38:40,762 --> 02:38:42,138
Hello, John.

1865
02:38:43,515 --> 02:38:45,809
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1866
02:38:46,768 --> 02:38:48,353
Another couple of days.

1867
02:39:01,950 --> 02:39:04,452
Is there anything special you
wanna eat for dinner that night?

1868
02:39:05,453 --> 02:39:07,288
We can rustle you up
most anything.

1869
02:39:17,799 --> 02:39:19,759
Meat loaf be nice.

1870
02:39:19,843 --> 02:39:23,763
Mashed taters, gravy. Okra.

1871
02:39:25,390 --> 02:39:28,143
Maybe some of that fine
corn bread your missus make...

1872
02:39:28,977 --> 02:39:30,895
If she don't mind.

1873
02:39:33,314 --> 02:39:34,649
Now, uh...

1874
02:39:35,316 --> 02:39:36,735
What about a preacher?

1875
02:39:36,818 --> 02:39:39,696
Someone to say
a little prayer with.

1876
02:39:40,363 --> 02:39:42,282
Don't want no preacher.

1877
02:39:43,658 --> 02:39:46,119
You can say a prayer,
if you like.

1878
02:39:46,911 --> 02:39:48,288
Me?

1879
02:39:50,999 --> 02:39:53,543
Suppose I could,
if it came to that.

1880
02:39:57,839 --> 02:39:58,923
John,

1881
02:40:01,885 --> 02:40:04,637
I have to ask you
something very important now.

1882
02:40:06,514 --> 02:40:08,516
I know what you gonna say.

1883
02:40:09,184 --> 02:40:10,518
You don't have to say it.

1884
02:40:11,019 --> 02:40:13,730
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1885
02:40:15,231 --> 02:40:16,691
John,

1886
02:40:18,359 --> 02:40:20,528
tell me what
you want me to do.

1887
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:23,406
You want me to
take you out of here?

1888
02:40:24,741 --> 02:40:26,785
Just let you run away?

1889
02:40:26,868 --> 02:40:28,578
See how far you could get?

1890
02:40:30,371 --> 02:40:32,665
Why would you do
such a foolish thing?

1891
02:40:35,001 --> 02:40:37,629
On the day of my judgment,

1892
02:40:37,712 --> 02:40:40,173
when I stand before God

1893
02:40:40,256 --> 02:40:43,551
and he asks me why did I...

1894
02:40:44,427 --> 02:40:48,807
...did I kill one
of his true miracles,

1895
02:40:50,433 --> 02:40:52,352
what am I going to say?

1896
02:40:53,561 --> 02:40:55,271
That it was my job?

1897
02:40:57,732 --> 02:40:59,150
It's my job.

1898
02:40:59,859 --> 02:41:03,863
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1899
02:41:07,659 --> 02:41:09,828
I know you're
hurting and worrying.

1900
02:41:10,829 --> 02:41:12,831
I can feel it on you.

1901
02:41:12,914 --> 02:41:14,499
But you ought to
quit on it now.

1902
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:18,086
I want it to be
over and done with.

1903
02:41:19,379 --> 02:41:20,463
I do.

1904
02:41:25,426 --> 02:41:27,011
I'm tired, boss.

1905
02:41:28,555 --> 02:41:30,431
I'm tired of
being on the road,

1906
02:41:30,515 --> 02:41:32,600
lonely as
a sparrow in the rain.

1907
02:41:34,269 --> 02:41:37,063
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with,

1908
02:41:37,647 --> 02:41:41,609
to tell me where we's going
to, coming from, or why.

1909
02:41:43,111 --> 02:41:46,823
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1910
02:41:48,283 --> 02:41:52,078
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world,

1911
02:41:52,704 --> 02:41:54,038
every day.

1912
02:41:54,581 --> 02:41:56,457
There's too much of it.

1913
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,128
It's like pieces
of glass in my head,

1914
02:42:00,962 --> 02:42:02,422
all the time.

1915
02:42:04,966 --> 02:42:06,676
Can you understand?

1916
02:42:09,679 --> 02:42:12,307
Yes, John, I think I can.

1917
02:42:15,143 --> 02:42:17,353
Well, there must be
something we can do for you, John.

1918
02:42:20,732 --> 02:42:22,567
There must be
something that you want.

1919
02:42:32,327 --> 02:42:35,872
I ain't never seen
me a flicker show.

1920
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,585
Why, they's angels.

1921
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,506
Angels,
just like up in heaven.

1922
02:45:09,233 --> 02:45:11,194
It be all right,
fellas.

1923
02:45:12,653 --> 02:45:14,697
This here's
the hard part.

1924
02:45:16,199 --> 02:45:17,658
I'll be all right
in a while.

1925
02:45:18,659 --> 02:45:22,914
John, I should have
this just for now.

1926
02:45:27,460 --> 02:45:29,420
I'll give it back after.

1927
02:45:32,757 --> 02:45:37,011
You know, I fell asleep this
afternoon and had me a dream.

1928
02:45:38,846 --> 02:45:40,681
I dreamed about
Del's mouse.

1929
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:43,184
Did you, John?

1930
02:45:43,851 --> 02:45:48,523
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1931
02:45:48,606 --> 02:45:50,483
That Mouseville place.

1932
02:45:51,234 --> 02:45:53,402
I dreamed there's kids.

1933
02:45:54,195 --> 02:45:57,907
And how they laughed at his
tricks. My!

1934
02:45:59,867 --> 02:46:03,329
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1935
02:46:04,038 --> 02:46:06,040
They's laughing, too.

1936
02:46:06,124 --> 02:46:09,377
I put my arms around them
and set 'em on my knees.

1937
02:46:09,460 --> 02:46:11,504
And there's no blood
coming out of they hair,

1938
02:46:11,587 --> 02:46:13,589
and they's just fine.

1939
02:46:13,673 --> 02:46:16,801
We all watched
Mr. Jingles roll that spool.

1940
02:46:18,302 --> 02:46:19,595
How we did laugh.

1941
02:46:19,679 --> 02:46:21,430
Fit to bust, we was!

1942
02:46:37,572 --> 02:46:38,698
John.

1943
02:46:39,907 --> 02:46:44,078
They's lots
of folks here that hate me. Lots!

1944
02:46:45,913 --> 02:46:47,415
I can feel it.

1945
02:46:48,124 --> 02:46:50,042
It's like bees stinging me.

1946
02:46:50,418 --> 02:46:52,628
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1947
02:46:54,130 --> 02:46:55,214
We don't hate you.

1948
02:46:56,757 --> 02:46:58,217
Can you feel that?

1949
02:47:00,553 --> 02:47:02,471
Kill him twice, you boys!

1950
02:47:03,431 --> 02:47:07,560
You go on and kill that
raping baby killer twice!

1951
02:47:07,643 --> 02:47:09,187
That'd be fine!

1952
02:47:25,995 --> 02:47:28,456
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1953
02:47:28,873 --> 02:47:30,124
Yes, sir.

1954
02:47:42,220 --> 02:47:43,387
Roll on one.

1955
02:47:51,437 --> 02:47:54,815
Does it hurt yet?
I hope it does.

1956
02:47:55,816 --> 02:47:57,818
I hope it hurts
like hell.

1957
02:48:00,071 --> 02:48:01,781
John Coffey,
you've been condemned to die

1958
02:48:01,864 --> 02:48:04,033
in the electric chair
by a jury of your peers.

1959
02:48:04,116 --> 02:48:07,954
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1960
02:48:08,037 --> 02:48:10,831
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1961
02:48:13,084 --> 02:48:15,044
I'm sorry for what I am.

1962
02:48:27,682 --> 02:48:29,141
Please, boss,

1963
02:48:30,685 --> 02:48:33,145
don't put that thing
over my face.

1964
02:48:34,647 --> 02:48:36,649
Don't put me in the dark.

1965
02:48:37,650 --> 02:48:39,860
I's afraid of the dark.

1966
02:48:49,954 --> 02:48:51,330
All right, John.

1967
02:49:11,726 --> 02:49:14,729
<i>Heaven,
I'm in heaven</i>

1968
02:49:14,812 --> 02:49:17,815
<i>Heaven, heaven</i>

1969
02:49:17,898 --> 02:49:19,650
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1970
02:49:20,192 --> 02:49:22,737
<i>Heaven, heaven</i>

1971
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:24,739
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1972
02:49:25,281 --> 02:49:26,782
<i>Heaven</i>

1973
02:49:27,742 --> 02:49:30,244
<i>Heaven, I'm in heaven</i>

1974
02:49:30,828 --> 02:49:32,621
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1975
02:49:32,705 --> 02:49:34,332
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1976
02:49:34,415 --> 02:49:35,958
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1977
02:49:36,792 --> 02:49:37,960
<i>Heaven</i>

1978
02:49:38,044 --> 02:49:39,253
<i>Heaven</i>

1979
02:49:39,962 --> 02:49:41,005
<i>Heaven</i>

1980
02:49:45,843 --> 02:49:47,261
John Coffey,

1981
02:49:48,387 --> 02:49:50,014
electricity shall
now be passed

1982
02:49:50,097 --> 02:49:51,682
through your body
until you are dead

1983
02:49:51,766 --> 02:49:53,601
in accordance
with state law.

1984
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:59,565
May God have mercy
on your soul.

1985
02:50:34,475 --> 02:50:35,518
Paul.

1986
02:50:38,729 --> 02:50:40,481
You have to say it.

1987
02:50:42,316 --> 02:50:44,443
You have to
give the order.

1988
02:51:02,711 --> 02:51:05,005
<i>He killed 'em
with they love.</i>

1989
02:51:05,089 --> 02:51:09,176
<i>That's how it is every day
all over the world.</i>

1990
02:51:23,691 --> 02:51:25,234
Roll on two.

1991
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:12,550
<i>It was the last
execution I ever took part in.</i>

1992
02:53:13,425 --> 02:53:16,053
I just couldn't do it
anymore after that.

1993
02:53:16,136 --> 02:53:19,390
Brutal either.
We both transferred out,

1994
02:53:19,473 --> 02:53:22,393
took jobs with
Boys' Correctional.

1995
02:53:23,269 --> 02:53:24,895
It was all right.

1996
02:53:25,729 --> 02:53:28,232
"Catch them young"
became my motto.

1997
02:53:31,819 --> 02:53:33,112
You don't believe me.

1998
02:53:33,904 --> 02:53:36,532
I don't imagine
you'd lie to me, Paul.

1999
02:53:37,157 --> 02:53:39,577
It's just that...
It's quite a story.

2000
02:53:39,660 --> 02:53:41,370
It's quite a story.

2001
02:53:42,246 --> 02:53:44,707
One thing I don't understand.

2002
02:53:44,790 --> 02:53:50,004
You said you and Jan
had a grown son in 1935.

2003
02:53:50,588 --> 02:53:52,089
Is that right?

2004
02:53:52,548 --> 02:53:54,508
The math doesn't work,
does it?

2005
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:02,516
Do you feel up
to taking a walk?

2006
02:54:23,412 --> 02:54:24,663
Watch your step.

2007
02:54:25,414 --> 02:54:27,416
Now let your eyes adjust.

2008
02:54:39,553 --> 02:54:40,721
There.

2009
02:54:43,223 --> 02:54:47,061
Hey. Wake up,
old fella. Wake up.

2010
02:54:51,065 --> 02:54:54,818
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

2011
02:54:59,323 --> 02:55:00,741
Come over here, boy.

2012
02:55:01,367 --> 02:55:03,577
Come on over here
and see this lady.

2013
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:09,249
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

2014
02:55:32,189 --> 02:55:34,108
Go on, you can do it.

2015
02:55:41,782 --> 02:55:45,661
This isn't exactly the
Mouseville we had in mind, is it?

2016
02:55:47,121 --> 02:55:50,416
But we make do.
Don't we, old fella?

2017
02:55:57,506 --> 02:56:00,426
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

2018
02:56:01,677 --> 02:56:06,056
I think when we electrocuted
Del, and it all went so badly...

2019
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,892
Well, John could
feel that, you know.

2020
02:56:09,393 --> 02:56:11,979
And I think a part of

2021
02:56:13,063 --> 02:56:15,733
whatever magic
was inside of him

2022
02:56:15,816 --> 02:56:18,485
just leapt into
my tiny friend here.

2023
02:56:20,362 --> 02:56:21,989
As for me,

2024
02:56:23,449 --> 02:56:25,909
John had to give me
a part of himself,

2025
02:56:26,452 --> 02:56:28,746
a gift, the way he saw it,

2026
02:56:28,829 --> 02:56:31,790
so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

2027
02:56:34,668 --> 02:56:36,420
When John did that,

2028
02:56:38,464 --> 02:56:40,257
when he took my hand,

2029
02:56:41,759 --> 02:56:43,510
a part of the power

2030
02:56:44,094 --> 02:56:45,679
that worked through him

2031
02:56:46,513 --> 02:56:48,098
spilled into me.

2032
02:56:48,932 --> 02:56:50,184
He what?

2033
02:56:51,018 --> 02:56:54,646
He infected you with life?

2034
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:58,275
It's as good a word as any.

2035
02:56:59,985 --> 02:57:04,031
He infected us both, didn't
he, Mr. Jingles? With life.

2036
02:57:08,702 --> 02:57:11,038
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

2037
02:57:11,997 --> 02:57:15,542
I was 44 the year that John
Coffey walked the Green Mile.

2038
02:57:19,213 --> 02:57:21,131
You mustn't blame John.

2039
02:57:21,673 --> 02:57:23,133
He couldn't help
what happened.

2040
02:57:23,217 --> 02:57:26,512
He was...
He's just a force of nature.

2041
02:57:28,096 --> 02:57:31,892
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

2042
02:57:33,519 --> 02:57:35,729
Another century come to pass.

2043
02:57:36,730 --> 02:57:38,065
But I've...

2044
02:57:39,274 --> 02:57:43,445
I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

2045
02:57:44,196 --> 02:57:45,781
Hal and Melinda,

2046
02:57:46,615 --> 02:57:48,116
Brutus Howell,

2047
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:50,410
my wife, my boy.

2048
02:57:53,872 --> 02:57:55,457
And you, Elaine.

2049
02:57:56,792 --> 02:57:58,418
You'll die, too.

2050
02:57:59,962 --> 02:58:03,674
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

2051
02:58:05,884 --> 02:58:07,970
It's my atonement, you see.

2052
02:58:08,887 --> 02:58:10,556
It's my punishment

2053
02:58:10,848 --> 02:58:13,433
for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning,

2054
02:58:15,227 --> 02:58:17,437
<i>for killing a miracle of God.</i>

2055
02:58:19,356 --> 02:58:21,775
<i>Almighty,
everlasting God,</i>

2056
02:58:22,651 --> 02:58:24,611
the source of all
being and life...

2057
02:58:25,362 --> 02:58:29,116
<i>You'll be gone like
all the others. I'll have to stay.</i>

2058
02:58:31,535 --> 02:58:34,997
<i>Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.</i>

2059
02:58:36,331 --> 02:58:39,459
<i>I have no illusions
of immortality.</i>

2060
02:58:40,627 --> 02:58:42,963
<i>But I will have
wished for death</i>

2061
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:45,716
<i>long before death finds me.</i>

2062
02:58:47,384 --> 02:58:50,345
<i>In truth,
I wish for it already.</i>

2063
02:59:03,233 --> 02:59:04,651
Mr. Jingles?

2064
02:59:14,161 --> 02:59:15,954
Where you been, hmm?

2065
02:59:16,705 --> 02:59:20,834
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry, hmm?

2066
02:59:20,918 --> 02:59:23,253
Let's go see if we can't
find you something to eat.

2067
02:59:24,504 --> 02:59:26,256
A few crumbs anyway.

2068
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:28,258
I know you'd like that.

2069
02:59:29,551 --> 02:59:31,553
Look at you. Mr. Jingles.

2070
02:59:32,638 --> 02:59:35,849
<i>I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.</i>

2071
02:59:36,683 --> 02:59:38,060
<i>And I wait.</i>

2072
02:59:39,353 --> 02:59:42,439
<i>I think about all
the people I've loved,</i>

2073
02:59:42,522 --> 02:59:44,024
<i>now long gone.</i>

2074
02:59:45,484 --> 02:59:47,986
<i>I think about
my beautiful Jan,</i>

2075
02:59:48,070 --> 02:59:50,489
<i>how I lost her
so many years ago.</i>

2076
02:59:52,366 --> 02:59:57,412
<i>And I think about all of us
walking our own Green Mile,</i>

2077
02:59:57,496 --> 02:59:59,289
<i>each in our own time.</i>

2078
03:00:01,083 --> 03:00:04,211
<i>But one thought
more than any other</i>

2079
03:00:04,294 --> 03:00:06,380
<i>keeps me awake most nights.</i>

2080
03:00:08,173 --> 03:00:11,426
<i>If he could make
a mouse live so long,</i>

2081
03:00:12,678 --> 03:00:14,721
<i>how much longer do I have?</i>

2082
03:00:19,142 --> 03:00:21,561
<i>We each owe a death.</i>

2083
03:00:22,145 --> 03:00:24,106
<i>There are no exceptions.</i>

2084
03:00:25,357 --> 03:00:26,817
<i>But, oh, God,</i>

2085
03:00:28,402 --> 03:00:30,070
<i>sometimes,</i>

2086
03:00:30,696 --> 03:00:33,532
<i>the Green Mile
seems so long.</i>
