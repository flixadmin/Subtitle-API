1
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,124
Oi!

2
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,043
Mind out.

3
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,380
Move!

4
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,147
Look, on the west wall!

5
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,858
Get down to the crypt!

6
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,029
Just hold.

7
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,323
We'll take him.

8
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,580
-Come on, help the lads!
-Yes, my lady.

9
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,416
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

10
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,793
-Come on.
-Close the gate!

11
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,754
That's it.

12
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,958
Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time.

13
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you speak their tongue?

14
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,881
Tell them to lift their swords.

15
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,214
-Open the gate!
-Open the gate!

16
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,150
Come. Come on.

17
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,527
Easy.

18
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,725
There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos.
I'll be dead before the dawn.

19
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,242
The Night King is coming.

20
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,871
The dead are already here.

21
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,166
Stand your ground!

22
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,151
Get down to the crypt.

23
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,323
-I'm not abandoning my people.
-Take this and go.

24
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,829
I don't know how to use it.

25
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,832
Stick them with the pointy end.

26
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,794
Edd!

27
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,130
Edd!

28
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,567
Sam, get up!

29
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,741
Oh, God. Sam.

30
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,517
Fall back! Fall back!

31
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,773
-Fall back!
-Come on!

32
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,486
-Open the gate!
-Open the gate!

33
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,614
Let us in!

34
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,950
-Open the gate!
-Open the gate!

35
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,163
Keep moving!

36
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,251
Come on!

37
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,799
-Keep moving, fast.
-To your posts.

38
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,884
-Go!
-Keep moving!

39
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,014
-Come on, run!
-Keep moving!

40
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,113
Dany!

41
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,226
-Grab your weapon now!
-Guard the barricades!

42
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,769
Through that pass!

43
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,648
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Close up the gaps!

44
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,902
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

45
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,572
Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!

46
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,316
Move!

47
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,353
-Come on!
-Come on!

48
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,729
-Come on!
-Come on!

49
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,901
-Protect the gate!
-Protect the gate!

50
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,989
They're coming! Come on! Fall back!

51
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,512
Light the trench! Light the trench!

52
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,974
-Wait!
-Light the trench!

53
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,047
She can't see us.

54
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,258
Light the trenches!

55
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,651
With a torch, light the trenches!
Right there. Torch it!

56
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,905
Light the trenches!

57
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,529
Clegane.

58
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
You must try not to worry yourself.

59
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,344
At least we're already in a crypt.

60
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,850
If we were up there,

61
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,604
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

62
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,692
Something that makes a difference.

63
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,194
What?

64
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,322
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

65
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,200
-And got your face cut in half.
-And it made a difference.

66
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,414
-If I was out there right now--
-You'd die.

67
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,585
There's nothing you can do.

68
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,550
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

69
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,719
to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

70
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,222
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

71
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,974
Witty remarks won't make a difference.

72
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,479
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

73
00:30:59,024 --> 00:30:59,983
It's the truth.

74
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,153
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

75
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,865
look the truth in the face.

76
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,039
Maybe we should have stayed married.

77
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,249
You were the best of them.

78
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,128
What a terrifying thought.

79
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,511
It wouldn't work between us.

80
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,682
-Why not?
-The Dragon Queen.

81
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,646
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

82
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,440
Yes.

83
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,860
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

84
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,655
We'd all be dead already.

85
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,719
They lit the trench.

86
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,943
Bran...

87
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,866
I just want you to know...

88
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,455
I wish...

89
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,458
The things I did--

90
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,544
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

91
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,381
Where you belong.

92
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,009
Home.

93
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,105
I'm going to go now.

94
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,568
Go where?

95
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,469
Man the walls!

96
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,305
Man the walls!

97
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,484
-Man the wall!
-Man the walls!

98
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,320
Come on!

99
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,282
Get up there! Get moving!

100
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,577
Come on. Come on! Come on!

101
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,331
Go, go, go, go, go!

102
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,083
Come on!

103
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,750
They're against the wall!

104
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,756
Get more men up here!

105
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,426
Come on, hurry up!

106
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,804
-Fill the gaps! Quickly!
-Get in there!

107
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,972
They're climbing the walls!

108
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,308
-Relieve the archers!
-Relieve the archers!

109
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,312
Archers on top!

110
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,981
-Move up!
-Go, go! Come here!

111
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,399
-Come on!
-Move back!

112
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,360
-Step away!
-Go, go!

113
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,946
-Step back.
-All the way, archers!

114
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,798
-Hold the wall!
-The wall, they're coming up!

115
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,424
Hold the wall!

116
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:00,927
Draw!

117
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,828
Come on!

118
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,518
Look out!

119
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,702
Clegane!

120
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,288
Clegane!

121
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:26,859
Clegane!

122
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,278
Clegane, we need you!

123
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,699
-You can't give up on us.
-Fuck off! We can't beat them.

124
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,952
Don't you see that, you stupid whore?

125
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,288
-We're fighting death!
-I can't beat death.

126
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,586
Tell her that.

127
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,047
-Come on!
-Open the door!

128
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,632
Open the door!

129
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,348
Open it!

130
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,862
Come on! Go!

131
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,990
Go on! Run!

132
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,309
We've gotta go!

133
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,290
The Lord brought him back for a purpose.

134
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,255
Now that purpose has been served.

135
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:01,887
I know you.

136
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,727
And I know you.

137
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,819
You said we'd meet again.

138
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,155
And here we are.

139
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,491
At the end of the world.

140
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,453
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

141
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,623
You were right about that too.

142
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,669
Brown eyes, green eyes...

143
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,506
and blue eyes.

144
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,444
What do we say to the God of Death?

145
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,158
Not today.

146
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,852
Here they come!

147
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,690
Steady, lads.

148
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:38,942
Steady now.

149
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,238
Make every shot count.

150
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,623
Over there!

151
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,386
Come on! Come on!

152
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,193
-Bran!
-Go!

153
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,262
Jorah!

154
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:05,928
Theon.

155
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,025
You're a good man.

156
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:26,323
Thank you.

157
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,440
I'm hurt.
