1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,537
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,642
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:57,912
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,590
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:12,594
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:24,672
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,610
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,148
What did you say?

9
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:36,151
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,920
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:42,791
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,161
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,963
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:51,800
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,435
Is that it?

16
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,637
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,040
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:04,512
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

19
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,655
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,660
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--

21
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,542
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:38,813
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:45,587
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,809
Adjusting for inflation....

25
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,711
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

26
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,447
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:51,619
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,824
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:56,024 --> 00:05:00,095
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:04,099
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

31
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,401
...say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:10,105
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:16,177
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:21,883
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:24,953
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,125
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:33,695
That is what I need.

38
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,265
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:40,301
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:45,039
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,412
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:16,871
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:34,656
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:43,198
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,633
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:49,170
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,039
-Oh, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

48
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,542
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:57,212
-Do something.
-Do something?

50
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,781
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,350
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,918
Do that-- Do that thing.

53
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,392
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

54
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,026
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:14,529
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:18,400
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,139
No.

58
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:58,440
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,809
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,811
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,852
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,988
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:51,259
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:13,047
What's the big hurry?

65
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:21,656
Oh, I.... I just think we're done here.

66
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,758
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:39,407
You're done.

68
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,091
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:09,064
Hello?

70
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,512
<i>Are already married--</i>

71
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,114
Hello?

72
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,186
<i>Thank you to our viewers--</i>

73
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,288
Hey.

74
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:37,358
<i>The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:40,228
Walt?

76
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:43,531
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:46,568
Walt.

78
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,908
Walt.

79
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:57,278
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

80
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,748
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,587
Are you okay?

82
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,990
Great.

83
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:14,562
New hat?

84
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,566
Yeah.

85
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,570
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,606
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

87
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:28,676
<i>But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...</i>

88
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:32,414
<i>...like airports, golf courses--</i>

89
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,631
Where've you been?

90
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,529
What is...?

91
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:27,669
What are you doing?

92
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:29,904
Okay.

93
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,241
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,477
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:39,681
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so....

96
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,817
Okay. Yeah, just....

97
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,487
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,757
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,092
Stop it!

100
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,879
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:50,351
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,424
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,300
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,811
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,447
Dead, man.

106
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,249
<i>Ruto or rute
or however the hell you--</i>

107
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,285
-This is conjecture.
-This is conjecture?

108
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,420
-Conjecture isn't helping.
-Conjecture--?

109
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,990
-We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:39,294
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,262
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

112
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:43,832
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:46,468
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,237
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:53,074
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:57,712
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:57,912 --> 00:17:00,749
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...

118
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,552
...saying, "You're done."

119
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:05,754
"You're done"?

120
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,590
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,659
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:14,462
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,898
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

124
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:21,569
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,042
What happens
when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,085
No.

127
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:40,055
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:53,234
-How would you do it?
-What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:56,938
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:01,142
All right.

131
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:04,145
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:07,549
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,985
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:15,523
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,560
So three shots?

136
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,497
-Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:25,100
-Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,735
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:30,438
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,276
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,512
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

142
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:39,748
-...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

143
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:42,150
-You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him--

144
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,185
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:45,754
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:47,756
-I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

147
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:50,759
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,560
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,931
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:01,770
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:06,408
All right.

152
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:09,911
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,080
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:15,316
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,257
It's not--

156
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,803
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

157
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:37,639
...and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:45,180
-It's not that easy, is it?
-Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

159
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,120
Yeah.

160
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,001
Call Skyler.

161
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,812
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

162
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,549
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

163
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,119
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

164
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,921
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

165
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,590
...over by UNM tonight...

166
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,292
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

167
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,595
Listen to me. "Hang."

168
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:37,098
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

169
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,867
I'm still hip.

170
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:42,170
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,273
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

172
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:50,645
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:55,850
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

174
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:58,753
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

175
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:03,658
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,361
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:10,131
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,635
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,038
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:27,148
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,651
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,820
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,824
-How late they serve?
-I don't know.

184
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:37,892
You got Dave at 8.

185
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:43,164
-Not tonight.
-Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:44,933
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:49,637
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

188
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,107
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,943
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

190
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,245
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,580
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:58,813 --> 00:22:01,716
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,120
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,522
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:20,135
Look, it's.... You know, it's just....

196
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,037
Oh, boy. I....

197
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:27,509
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:22:29,444 --> 00:22:31,079
Yeah.

199
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:34,049
Yeah.

200
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:49,330
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:59,174
She's....

202
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:08,149
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,887
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

204
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,623
-...and then he says, "Give me a four."
-Hey, Gomez.

205
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:18,359
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,595
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,198
Good morning to you too.

208
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:30,071
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:33,208
-You know Southwest Aniline, right?
-Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:34,642
The place smells like feet.

211
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:37,112
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:43,985
-Holy shit. What was that?
-Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:45,954
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:48,156
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:52,026
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,298
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,302
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:05,240
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:07,242
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,414
-So, what'd they get?
-Methylamine, 30 gallons.

221
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:15,817
P2P?

222
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:18,887
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

223
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:20,789
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,792
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,528
Pseudo's in short supply...

226
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:30,265
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:33,068
That and the thermite...

228
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:35,437
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

229
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,339
-But ranking them as burglars?
-Shit.

230
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,376
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:44,846
They got book learning
but no street skills.

232
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,414
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:48,450
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

234
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:50,885
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,688
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor....

236
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,991
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,696
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

238
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,632
...and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:33,021
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,754
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

241
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:08,590
<i>We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.</i>

242
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,127
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

243
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:13,828
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier...</i>

244
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,665
<i>...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.</i>

245
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,134
<i>I'm realising now...</i>

246
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:22,337
<i>...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...</i>

247
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:25,840
<i>...owing to the extra baby weight--</i>

248
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:29,477
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,952
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,722
No.

251
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:44,159
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:50,065
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of--
My stomach, you know.

253
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:54,269
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,766
-How would he know where I live?
-You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,067
Who else could it be?

256
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,303
-Did you ever tell him my name?
-No.

257
00:28:28,536 --> 00:28:30,472
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:32,574
-No.
-What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,943
-Did you tell them anything?
-I didn't say jack.

260
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:38,680
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:43,017
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:50,492
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:52,660
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,037
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,674
I finally figured out how to....
Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.

266
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,477
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:29:09,677 --> 00:29:13,615
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:15,583
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:18,953
I've got a better idea.

270
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:23,058
Thank God.

271
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,659
All right.

272
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:27,195
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:32,534
-Beans.
-Beans?

274
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:36,071
They're castor beans.

275
00:29:36,304 --> 00:29:37,906
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

276
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,643
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

277
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,445
Climb it and escape?

278
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,082
We are going to process them
into ricin.

279
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:49,918
Rice and beans?

280
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:55,090
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

281
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,625
It's toxic in small doses.

282
00:29:57,826 --> 00:30:00,261
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,264
All right.

284
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:06,267
-All right. So--
-Don't touch them.

285
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,638
-You can get poisoned from beans?
-Yes.

286
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,343
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,180
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

288
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,483
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

289
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:25,086
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:28,690
But it-- It killed him?

291
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,825
Oh, yes.

292
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:35,497
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

293
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:40,668
...and then no more Tuco.

294
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:24,279
-Hey, Sky.
-Hey, Hank.

295
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:26,514
How you doing?

296
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:29,718
Is this.... This a bad time?

297
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,422
No, come on in.

298
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:45,166
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,104
What can I do for you?

300
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,210
Maybe we ought--

301
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:57,379
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,147
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,517
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:09,758
-Did she send you?
-Hell, no.

305
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,527
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:14,562
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:18,867
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,805
Look...

309
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:26,574
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

310
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,243
-I get it.
-Gals.

311
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:31,780
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:36,985
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:41,956
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:46,027
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:49,664
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:52,167
Just call her back.

317
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,141
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:03,411
That's right.

319
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,549
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:11,019
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:14,556
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:19,227
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

323
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,296
Yeah.

324
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,935
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know....

325
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,310
You knew about this.

326
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:38,880
We're working on it.

327
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,183
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:45,286
-And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:48,123
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

330
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:52,027
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,661
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:57,565
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:00,568
Do we?

334
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:02,137
Yeah.

335
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,306
I need support.

336
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,309
Me.

337
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,512
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

338
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:12,514
...with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:14,916
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

340
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,852
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,055
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:23,258
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,226
And the overdrawn
checking account.

344
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:28,963
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

345
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:31,866
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

346
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,235
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:37,405
But, oh, I see.

348
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:40,241
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

349
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,944
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

350
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:45,880
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

351
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:49,017
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:55,190
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:13,742
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

354
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:47,842
That's all it takes?

355
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,579
That's all it takes.

356
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:55,316
So now what?

357
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,620
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:01,189
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:03,425
Business as usual.

360
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,328
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:13,802
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:15,170
Care to try it?"

363
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:18,173
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:21,543
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:23,278
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,981
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:29,617
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:33,288
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:36,658
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

370
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:43,064
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

371
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:45,834
...it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:50,105
-What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

373
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:52,240
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,276
His associates won't know
any differently...

375
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:58,380
...and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,549
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,935
Just keep it down.

378
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,271
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:25,040
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

380
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:29,010
You been home yet?

381
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,881
No. Why?

382
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:34,449
<i>Well....</i>

383
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,019
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,322
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

385
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:44,292
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.</i>

386
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:49,764
<i>-I should have just kept out of it.
-Yeah, well, okay.</i>

387
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,533
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:55,437
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:58,206
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

390
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,343
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,912
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

392
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:07,649
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

393
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:12,687
Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.

394
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:14,622
You wanna see something
really freaky?

395
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:18,093
<i>-Well, I would, but--
-Seriously, Walt, this is....</i>

396
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:23,465
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:28,803
<i>Hank.</i>

398
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:31,106
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:37,645
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,350
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

401
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,520
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

402
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:50,091
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

403
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:53,928
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

404
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,770
-I'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need it!

405
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,572
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:07,909
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've....

407
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:11,513
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:54,656
Skyler?

409
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,731
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:11,072
Skyler?

411
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:57,952
Hey.

412
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,122
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:04,993
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:11,599
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:17,872
So where have you been
this time?

416
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:27,248
Walt?

417
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:42,397
Walt?

418
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:02,851
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,129
Walt!

420
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:17,766
I'll be right there.

421
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:29,077
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

422
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:31,680
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

423
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:33,148
...named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,917
-Guess he got tired of associating.
-Yeah.

425
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:38,753
-Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
-No, go ahead.

426
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:41,222
Thanks.

427
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,861
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,098
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:42:53,268 --> 00:42:57,939
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

430
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:01,876
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,679
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,083
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

433
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:21,830
Snap.

434
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,866
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:36,911
Oh, this is beautiful.

436
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:39,914
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,850
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

438
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,486
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:48,656
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

440
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:52,193
...when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:56,831
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:43:57,032 --> 00:44:01,603
-Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
-Don't you just?

443
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:03,938
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:07,409
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:17,485
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,762
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,019
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:32,260
Get in.

449
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:47,409
Get in.

450
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:04,325
Let's go.
