1
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:03,525
- Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:04,787
- What kind of egg is that?

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,659
- It's a dragon egg.
- Oh.

4
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:10,488
- Okay, you got
possessed by Neron.

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,969
- I can't stop!

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,492
I give up.
Do you hear me, Neron?

7
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,668
Spare Nate
and I'll let you have me.

8
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:22,022
- Neron?
- I can make you whole again.

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,111
- My nipple.
- Gary, no!

10
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:29,942
- Nora, I need your help.

11
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,640
I am asking you
to face another demon

12
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:33,033
as a member of the Time Bureau.

13
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,164
- Let's do this.

14
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,043
- All right,
enough of the sightseeing.

15
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,435
Can we go now?

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,350
I'm a bit knackered,
to be honest with you, mate.

17
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:47,699
- We're not here as tourists,
Johnny.

18
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:49,049
- Ah, right, you're
gonna get rid of me

19
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,702
in some dramatic fashion.

20
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,313
Get on with it, will you?

21
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,793
- I'm not gonna kill you.
- Not yet, anyway.

22
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,882
- I need you for a favor.
- Is that right?

23
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,189
- Mm, I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.

24
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,366
- Oh, right.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,500
I will gladly open up
a vortex right here

26
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:08,242
and give you the old heave-ho
to the great beyond.

27
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,548
- The door is not for me,
Johnny.

28
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,551
It's to bring someone here
from the other side.

29
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,293
- Tabitha.
- Ah, that's right.

30
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,903
If she comes straight
through the doorway,

31
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,123
she doesn't need a human vessel.

32
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,256
And what in that demented
demon brain of yours

33
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,910
makes you think that I'm going
to open a vortex for you, eh?

34
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,609
Unlike Gary,
I've still got both my nipples,

35
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,132
so you don't have much
to bargain with.

36
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,178
Speaking of which,

37
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,440
what have you done
with the Muppet?

38
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:33,919
- Gary's just fine.

39
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:37,053
He's back at the Time Bureau
taking care of business.

40
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:44,060
- Okay, Nora, you can do this.

41
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,411
Just... be normal.

42
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,847
You can be normal.

43
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,414
'Cause you are normal.

44
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,590
- Next.
- Come on!

45
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,681
- That's your ID picture?

46
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,161
- They wouldn't
let me retake it.

47
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,642
- Oh, it can't be that bad.
- Let me see.

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,823
Uh, maybe we'll just use your
photo from the wanted poster.

49
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,086
So your ID is in process.

50
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,480
- And you have me to help you
with your orientation.

51
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:13,655
- All that's left is this.

52
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,048
- What the hell's that?

53
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,180
- It's your start paperwork.

54
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:20,357
- No, I should be out
looking for Ray.

55
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,880
I really have to fill
all this out?

56
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,099
- I know.
- I know, Nora.

57
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,274
But until we have
a line on Neron,

58
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,536
there's really nothing
we can do.

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,711
And let's be honest, Nora.

60
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,974
You have a storied history here.

61
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,064
I need you to prove that you
can be a team player.

62
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,283
Have fun.

63
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,460
Oh, and you know what, Nora?

64
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,637
I'm really, really proud of you.

65
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,510
Welcome to the Bureau.

66
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,956
- Director Sharpe.
- I've been waiting for you.

67
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,262
- Gary, I told you,
no playing with my chair

68
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,524
until after hours.

69
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,613
- Oh, playtime's over.

70
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,397
Shut the door.

71
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,182
We need to talk.

72
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,278
- If Neron wanted John dead,

73
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,323
he would have killed him
on the spot.

74
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,151
He must need something from him.

75
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,632
We have to find them before
he can get what he wants.

76
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,199
- Who knows what he's doing
in Ray's name...

77
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,723
or his perfectly grass-fed
organic butter body?

78
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,072
- If Haircut's even there.

79
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,639
- We don't know
that Ray is gone.

80
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,684
- Look, everybody just breathe.
- Gideon's already on it.

81
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:27,685
- I've attuned
the magic-o-meter

82
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,557
to Constantine's frequency.

83
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,081
When he uses his abilities,
I can zero in on his location.

84
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,474
- And what do we do till then?

85
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,040
- Stress eat.
- Drink.

86
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,607
- Yeah, how'd you lot
survive until now?

87
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,653
- Look, until we get an alert,
we wait.

88
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:39,784
- Right, we wait.

89
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,874
I gotta go clear my head.

90
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,052
- What do you think
this is about?

91
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,054
- With everything
that's been going on,

92
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,536
I bet Director Sharpe is about
to lay down the plan of attack.

93
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,323
I've gathered you here because
today we're setting time aside

94
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,238
to conduct performance reviews.

95
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,065
But this time, I thought
it would be useful

96
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,893
if you were assessed
by one of your peers,

97
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,634
Agent Gary Green.

98
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,723
- Gary?

99
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,811
- Seriously?
- Huh?

100
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,117
- Thanks, doll.

101
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,077
How are my babies doing?

102
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,601
Let's rap for a sec.

103
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,255
- Is Gary cool now?

104
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,778
- That's impossible.

105
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,824
- Now, I know performance
reviews can be quite a drag,

106
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,565
but this year's gonna be
different 'cause you've got

107
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,828
superagent Gary Green
in your corner.

108
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,439
So no need to stress...

109
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,137
unless your infraction is
looking too good in that suit.

110
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,400
Agent Reyes knows
what I'm talking about.

111
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,056
- Oh, my God.
- I think she just swooned.

112
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,362
- This is a nightmare.

113
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,059
- So I'll be meeting
with agents one-on-one,

114
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,148
and, uh, wait till
I call your name.

115
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:42,412
Looking forward
to some good face time.

116
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,331
Ava, are you sure
this is the best time

117
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,941
for performance reviews?

118
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,291
- There's no better time
to assess the performance

119
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,770
of our operation.

120
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,990
- But are you sure
Gary's qualified for...

121
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,383
responsibilities?

122
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,123
- Of course, Mona.

123
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,038
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

124
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:14,183
Oh, my, what a big,
scary knife you've got.

125
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:17,360
I'd sooner be filleted
than do your bidding.

126
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,407
- This knife is not for you.

127
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,800
It's for Raymond.

128
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,759
The human body is fascinating.

129
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,413
Delicate, fragile.

130
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,807
Did you know that if I cut
this artery right here,

131
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,809
it will take only
a matter of minutes

132
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,159
before Ray's body
goes into shock

133
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:37,119
and eventually expires?

134
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,468
- Hey, big man.

135
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:39,469
Come on.
I know you're in there.

136
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,515
Snap out of it, eh?

137
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:42,777
- Ray's gone.

138
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,736
I've taken over his body.
We made a deal.

139
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,869
And you of all people
should know what it means

140
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,175
to make a deal with a demon.

141
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,221
Now, if Ray was still in here,

142
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,179
would he do this?

143
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,754
I knew I could make you
use your magic.

144
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,583
- Great, yeah.
- So you got me.

145
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,543
What's that big grin
all about, eh?

146
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,196
- Patience.

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,850
You'll see.

148
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,030
- Huh, I always took you
to be more Springsteen

149
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,728
than "The Rite of Spring."

150
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,384
- It's not for me.
- It's...

151
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:28,518
I read that classical music
is good for babies.

152
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,694
- Wow, this is very,
um, impressive.

153
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,957
- Yeah, I found a book
about dragons

154
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,438
in Constantine's collection.

155
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,137
- "The egg must incubate
under the mother

156
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,792
at her body temperature
lest the egg expire."

157
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,533
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit
on that thing.

158
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,666
- I figured as much.
- That's why I got a heat lamp.

159
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:52,237
We have to do
everything possible

160
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,762
to make sure nothing bad
happens to this egg.

161
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,070
- Hey.
- Hmm?

162
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,246
- The egg's gonna be okay.

163
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,596
I know it.

164
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,815
- Wait till Ray sees
that we have a dragon.

165
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,644
- He's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,037
- I've picked up an alert

167
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,908
with Constantine's
magical signature.

168
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:13,345
- That's them.

169
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,000
- The signal is coming
from 1.3 million years ago.

170
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,306
- That's the Ice Age.

171
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,960
- He's in the part
of North America

172
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,614
that would come to be known
as the Donner Pass,

173
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,485
named after a doomed group
of settlers in the 1800s

174
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:23,878
who resorted to cannibalism

175
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,401
after their food supplies
ran out.

176
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,360
- There is such thing
as too much exposition, Gideon.

177
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,021
- Hah, there they are.
- Our heroes.

178
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:47,292
Captain Lance, thanks
for coming all this way.

179
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,946
If you're looking for Ray,

180
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,687
he's, uh, checked out.

181
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,254
- Is Neron on comms?

182
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,777
- But if you'd like to join him,

183
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,909
I can make arrangements.

184
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,693
- Sara, open fire now.

185
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,347
This may be your only chance.

186
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,609
- We can't fire.
- That's Ray.

187
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,568
- Ray made a deal with a demon.
- He's gone.

188
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,570
We can't lose anyone else
to this bastard.

189
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,136
- Do it.
- What about you?

190
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,964
- Blow us both to kingdom come.

191
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,010
I'll be happy to go to hell
for the cause.

192
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,316
- Gideon, ready the blasters.

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,317
- Yes, Captain.

194
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,710
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hold up!

195
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,974
If we kill Neron in Ray's body,
we lose Ray forever.

196
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:19,063
- But if you let Neron walk,
then things are gonna get

197
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,152
much, much worse.
Trust me.

198
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,982
- Sara?
- Well, come on, boss.

199
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,812
- Something's wrong.

200
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,640
- Awaiting orders, Captain.

201
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,033
- Gideon...

202
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,687
- Fire.

203
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,300
- It's a trap!

204
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:54,055
- We gotta move!
- They're getting away!

205
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:54,577
- Get us out of here, Gideon!

206
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,146
- That's not good.

207
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,756
- By my calculations,

208
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,585
we're buried beneath
357 feet of ice and snow.

209
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,674
Plus, our primary temporal
delineator has been rendered

210
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,850
nonfunctional
with the extreme weather.

211
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,678
- Well, so that's it, then?
- We're just snowed in?

212
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,201
- Yeah, at the Donner Pass.

213
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,203
- No one's turning me
into beef jerky!

214
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,902
- Everyone calm down.
- Gideon, hail the Bureau.

215
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,698
- Should we leave a voice mail?

216
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,396
- Ava will get the alert.
- In the meantime, we wait.

217
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,181
Gideon, how long
until the ice thaws?

218
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,053
- The Ice Age ends
in 11,121 years.

219
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,185
- All right,
who we eating first?

220
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,665
'Cause shotgun, not.

221
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,623
- Captain, we're running
on reserve power.

222
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,364
I recommend disabling
all nonessential functions

223
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,235
to conserve energy
for life support.

224
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,585
- Do it.

225
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,804
We need to be responsible
and conserve power.

226
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,677
Cut off the main generator,
the fabricator,

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,895
and the thermostat.

228
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,637
- Neron is out there
with Ray and Constantine

229
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,640
all because we fell for his
trap because you fired on Ray.

230
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,511
- And what was your plan,
pretty?

231
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,426
Beat him to death
in a snowball fight?

232
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,776
- We were supposed
to take him in,

233
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,126
- not take him out, Mick.
- Ray's gone!

234
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,084
When a team member goes dark,

235
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,521
you end them
before they end you.

236
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,831
- Rory, with me.

237
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,963
You made the call.

238
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,529
You're helping us
get out of here.

239
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,271
- No problem.
- All right.

240
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,665
Always assumed
I'd go out alone, anyway.

241
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,107
- First you kill my friends,
and now you bring me

242
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,674
to this miserable era.

243
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,937
- Oh, Johnny,
quit being such a crybaby.

244
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,896
- I just did what I had to do.

245
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,767
Can't have your friends
getting in the way of us

246
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:38,986
creating that door to hell.

247
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,162
- There's still no way
I'm helping you.

248
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:43,860
Besides, the vortexes I make
are strictly one-way.

249
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,949
They suck you in.

250
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:48,169
And don't you think,
if my magic was powerful enough

251
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,693
to stabilize a vortex,
I wouldn't have saved Desmond

252
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,042
or Astra?

253
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,915
- Yes, and that's
why we're here.

254
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,700
As powerful as your magic is,
you can always teach

255
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,877
an old dog new tricks.

256
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,314
- And it's more than magic
that you need to learn.

257
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,664
- Oh, yeah, right.

258
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,491
So I'm supposed to learn
something off one

259
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,145
of these yokels, am I?

260
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,756
No, Johnny.

261
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,671
Not from them.

262
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,498
From a king.

263
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,157
- Hold on a minute.
- That bloke's got my face.

264
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,942
- That's because
he's your ancestor.

265
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,858
King Konstentyn,
ruler of these parts

266
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,556
and progenitor
of your magical bloodline.

267
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,822
- What kind of creature
do you think they're hunting?

268
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,041
- Can't be sure,

269
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,912
but I'm guessing
it wasn't rabbits.

270
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,349
- Make way for your king!

271
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
- Start paperwork, am I right?

272
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:47,010
- My forms keep getting
rejected because records show

273
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,839
I'm 15 and living
in a mental institution.

274
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,800
- I forget that we don't
have normal problems anymore.

275
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,846
Speaking of which,
Ava's having Gary

276
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,153
- do performance reviews.
- Okay.

277
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,460
I mean, he's not my first
choice for... responsibilities,

278
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,592
but don't we have bigger issues?

279
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,898
- Exactly.

280
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,030
And when I pointed that out,
Ava shut me down.

281
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,902
Not to stereotype,
but I think a clone

282
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,078
might have replaced her,
and we need to look into it.

283
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,079
- No.
- Yes.

284
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,080
- No.
- Yes.

285
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,124
- No!
- Yes!

286
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,170
- No!
- I just earned my freedom.

287
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,389
And I don't wanna get caught
going behind Ava's back.

288
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,782
You heard what she said.

289
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,349
I need to focus on being
a team player.

290
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:24,047
- She said Gary
is all the man we need.

291
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,093
That's not weird to you?

292
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,269
- Why is that weird?

293
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,401
Gary Green
isall the man we need.

294
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,408
- Okay, I will check on Gary,

295
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:40,934
and you contact the Waverider
and see if Sara knows anything.

296
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,240
- Mm-hmm.
- And then...

297
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,069
we're gonna find out
what form 37-C is.

298
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,070
- Okay.

299
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,166
Ah, this is useless!

300
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,951
Why don't we just
blast a way out?

301
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,822
- Using your heat gun in here,
Mr. Rory,

302
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,606
will deplete our low supply
of oxygen.

303
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,825
- Yeah, ease up, Mick.

304
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,174
Last time you pulled
the trigger,

305
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,176
we ended up here.

306
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,004
You're pissed at me
for firing on Haircut.

307
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,527
- Well, it's a good thing
that this Snart bloke

308
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,399
kept a supply of jackets,
though, isn't it?

309
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,704
They smell good too, actually.

310
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,576
What is that?
Is it sandalwood?

311
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,012
- Look, I'm pissed at you
because that

312
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,362
- wasn't your call to make.
- Someone had to make it.

313
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,408
It was our only chance
to take out Neron.

314
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,192
I made the call you should have.

315
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,455
- All right, guys, come on.
- Just pick away, will you?

316
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,761
- No, this is good.

317
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,243
All of a sudden,
now you care about the mission?

318
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:32,072
Where were you when Neron
took Ray in the first place?

319
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,769
- Oh, you're gonna put that
on me as well!

320
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,858
- All right, as much as I wanna
watch you guys duke it out,

321
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,034
lets save it for when
we're not freezing to death.

322
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,514
- You know what?

323
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,299
Both of you off scamming people
at some book convention

324
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,388
while there is a demon
on our ship.

325
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,738
- Mm, let me get
this straight, Captain.

326
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,872
You're the only one that can
have fun outside of this

327
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,787
rusted bucket of bolts?

328
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,876
All you do is spend time
with the girlfriend

329
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,053
and nothing's ever,
ever your fault!

330
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,839
- You know what?

331
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,144
You have all the answers.

332
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,973
You get us out of here.

333
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:10,458
- Oh, when I was a boy,
we used to run wild

334
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,808
in these woods
around the village.

335
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,941
Not a care in the world.

336
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,685
These same woods where
your children play today

337
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,862
and where my hunting party
just encountered

338
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:27,083
another dangerous beast that
threatens not just our safety

339
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,694
but our entire way of life.

340
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,784
- Oh, this bloke
is right tedious.

341
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,264
Why are we here?

342
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,179
- Because I want you to learn

343
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,486
that it was your ancestor
that created the rift

344
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,271
between humans
and magical creatures.

345
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,491
- And why would he do that?

346
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:47,016
- Because fear is a powerful
source of energy for magic.

347
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,540
The more he exploits these
creatures to stir up fear

348
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,499
in his people, the more powerful

349
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,240
his magic becomes.

350
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,198
- I come from a long line
of bastards,

351
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,983
but not even we
would resort to that.

352
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,159
- Because your kin
are always so right.

353
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,508
- Yes.

354
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,423
And if the king is sending
this creature to hell,

355
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:05,208
then surely it deserves it.

356
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:06,949
- Do you really think
that everyone in hell

357
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,429
deserves to be there?

358
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,083
What about Astra

359
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,954
or Raymond Palmer

360
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,303
or my Tabitha?

361
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,263
This is your opportunity
to make things right,

362
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,917
starting with her.

363
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,919
- You know, if your plan
is to guilt me

364
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,051
into doing what you want
by showing me the sins

365
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:25,794
of my forefather,
it ain't working, sunshine.

366
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,970
- But to another.

367
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:31,582
Behold the unholy beast!

368
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,065
- Hold on a minute.
- That's a Púca.

369
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:40,461
- May not look threatening,
but sometimes

370
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:44,595
in order to see
the true nature of a creature,

371
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,684
one must draw it out.

372
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,209
- No, no, no.
- He's got it all wrong.

373
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,950
They aren't evil.

374
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,691
- Guess your bloodline isn't as
righteous as you think it is.

375
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,955
- He's clearly misinformed.

376
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,869
- Well, if you think that,
maybe you should go

377
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,697
and have a chat with the king.

378
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,613
- You are truly blessed
that I am here,

379
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:06,748
for I alone can save you
from these monsters.

380
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,099
And tonight at the rise
of the low moon,

381
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:15,278
I will banish this creature
straight to hell.

382
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,682
- Agent Powell,
please report to my office

383
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,031
for your performance review.

384
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,393
Just need a signal
on the Waverider.

385
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,048
That's weird.

386
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,662
- What are you doing in here?

387
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:56,015
- Uh, just thought I would
check on the timeline.

388
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,582
Yep, looks good.

389
00:16:58,626 --> 00:16:59,844
- You have clearance for this?

390
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,194
- Have you completed
your performance review?

391
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,896
- Yes, I've had
my performance review.

392
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,768
- And how did it go?

393
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,905
- Gary Green
is all the man we need.

394
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,168
All: Gary Green
is all the man we need.

395
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,691
- Mm.

396
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,047
Nora!

397
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,657
- You were right.
- We have to talk.

398
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,093
But we can't do it here.

399
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,097
- The heat lamp
must have turned off

400
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,186
when Sara shut down
the generator.

401
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,059
- It's okay, Wickstable.
- You're gonna be okay.

402
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,538
- What... what did you call it?

403
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,324
- Wickstable.

404
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,848
The drawing I made
of Heyworld when I was a kid,

405
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,850
the one that inspired my dad,
the dragon in it,

406
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,678
I named it Wickstable.

407
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,593
I thought we could
just name it that.

408
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,551
But I'm open to other ideas.

409
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,380
- No, uh, I-I like...
- I like Wickstable.

410
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:02,298
Our little Wicksty.

411
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,823
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

412
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,347
but I think it needs
skin-to-skin contact

413
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,131
like the book said.

414
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,966
- I think it's working.

415
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,665
Hey, uh, why does it feel
like we skipped past

416
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:25,539
all the fun stuff
into, you know, this?

417
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,367
- We can still do the fun stuff.

418
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,548
- What about the egg?

419
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,159
- Um, there's other ways
we could create heat.

420
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,900
Seriously, dude?

421
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,642
- Yeah.

422
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,601
Come on, Gideon.

423
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,169
There's gotta be a way
to boost the engines.

424
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:50,041
Ray would know how to read this.

425
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,393
How much longer do we have
on life support?

426
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,786
- Power reserves
are at 34 hours, Captain.

427
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,572
- Hey, you got a second?
- Not now, Rory.

428
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:02,445
- I actually came here
to apologize for, uh,

429
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,186
blowing up before.

430
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,972
- Wow, that's...
- Thank you.

431
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,324
- And I should have never...
- And another thing!

432
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,937
Give it up, Charlie.

433
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:22,291
- Why were you wearing my face?

434
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,988
And were you about to apologize?

435
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,165
- Only because Charlie
was catfishing me.

436
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,383
- All right, shut up.

437
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,168
Do you think Ray would be
fighting right now?

438
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,431
No, he would be trying
to get us out of here.

439
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,479
- Yeah, you're right.
- He's always got a plan.

440
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,741
It's annoying.

441
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,395
- All right,
let's search Ray's quarters,

442
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,310
see if we can find
something helpful.

443
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,317
Thanks.

444
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,492
- Hmm.

445
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,322
- I tried talking to Ava,
and all she'd say was,

446
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,498
"Gary Green
is all the man we need."

447
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,283
Gary must be controlling
the Bureau somehow.

448
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,023
- It's those
performance reviews.

449
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,808
If we can find out
how he's doing it,

450
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,027
maybe we can find a way
to snap them out of it.

451
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,377
- I can try tapping
into my powers,

452
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,813
see if I can read him.

453
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,554
- If I can get to his office...
- No!

454
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,816
We're all we have left.

455
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,384
We can't risk losing each other.

456
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,863
I've got it.

457
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,214
We'll tell Gary you found
some security issues

458
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,563
in the containment cells.

459
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:20,523
You walk him
over here like this.

460
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,309
Then I'll close the cell doors
and you courier out,

461
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,963
- trapping him.
- That's a great idea.

462
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:32,013
- Yeah, just like that.

463
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,670
Okay, it works.

464
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,019
You can let me out now.

465
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,716
- I'm sorry.
- I can't do that right now.

466
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,805
- Sure, you can.
- Just use the hand thing.

467
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,547
- No, Mona,
you need a time-out.

468
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,723
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

469
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,159
No.

470
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,991
- Go and tell the others to
prepare the ritual for tonight.

471
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,255
- As you wish, my lord.

472
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,301
- You're wasting your time,
focusing on that monster.

473
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,608
A Púca only reflects
the person it's with.

474
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,914
It's only angry because
you scared the fur off it.

475
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,700
That creature doesn't deserve
to go to hell.

476
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:10,356
- I see not why I should heed
the advice of a stranger.

477
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:14,534
- Then perhaps you will heed
the advice... of your kin.

478
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,499
- I know not of any kin
outside of this village.

479
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,849
And yet the similarities
of your features...

480
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:28,983
- I'm a cousin from afar and a
practitioner of magic like you.

481
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,812
If you want to rid your village
of a real monster,

482
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,857
then I know of a demon
in our midst

483
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,338
that we can banish together.

484
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,297
- A demon?

485
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,689
In my village?

486
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,780
Well, then lead the way, my kin.

487
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,831
But this face stealer
with the other creature.

488
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,136
- Aye, my liege.

489
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,703
- Hell shall have
two more guests

490
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,357
by the end of the night.

491
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:02,973
- "Cards to Save the Timeline:

492
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:06,890
a team-building card game
by Ray Palmer."

493
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:11,155
- Ah, I miss hating him.

494
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,940
- You remember that night
when we all met,

495
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,159
standing up on that rooftop,
and Rip told us

496
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,987
that we were gonna be legends?

497
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,469
- Mm-hmm, embarrassing.

498
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,471
You know what?

499
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:25,953
We're the last of the originals.

500
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:26,954
- Weird.

501
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,912
- Yeah, weird.

502
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,569
- Legends were different
back then.

503
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,528
We were different back then.

504
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,533
Look, I know
that book convention

505
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,925
was important to you.

506
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,972
And I'm really glad
that you got to go.

507
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,626
- I'm glad you have Ava.

508
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,541
- Thanks.

509
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,806
- Guess we're growing up...

510
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,243
and hopefully not growing apart.

511
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,856
- Ah, here we are.

512
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,380
- What is it?

513
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,599
- "Ray Palmer's
Survival Guide."

514
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,296
- Let me see this.

515
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,516
Oh, hey.

516
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,693
"What to do if you're caught
in an avalanche."

517
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,129
- Uh-huh, what does it say?

518
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:14,610
- Yeah, we've already tried
all of these.

519
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:17,700
"If all fails, remember
you still have each other,

520
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,702
so enjoy that as long
as it lasts."

521
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,704
- Ah, we're dead.

522
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,533
- Yeah. Maybe.

523
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,628
- Hey, it's all right,
little one.

524
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:33,890
I don't bite.

525
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,676
- Ah!

526
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,243
- I see your talk went well.

527
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,073
- Knew you'd be here.

528
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:47,077
- Ah, so I come from
a long line of bloody bastards.

529
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,123
Big reveal.

530
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,084
Have you even considered
what it's really gonna be like

531
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:57,610
for you in hell with all those
pissed-off folks you sent there

532
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:00,874
just waiting for you?

533
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,353
Including my Tabitha.

534
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,094
- Tabitha.

535
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,922
Who is this bird, anyway?

536
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,620
Why is she so important?

537
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,361
- Who is she?
- Yeah.

538
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,233
- You're just like
your ancestor.

539
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,017
So convinced
you're always right.

540
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,629
You don't even know
who you're sending away.

541
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,806
Fitting that he's about
to do the same to you.

542
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:23,200
But once you see
how powerful magic can be

543
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,203
when fueled by fear,
you can save yourself

544
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,944
from being sucked to hell.

545
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:34,647
Oh, you would love for me
to stabilize that vortex,

546
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,170
wouldn't you?

547
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,650
You see, the thing is,

548
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm not afraid of going to hell.

549
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:44,134
I've always counted on the fact
that I'd end up there one day

550
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,310
no matter what.

551
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:49,879
- And what about this
innocent creature beside you?

552
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:59,715
- Well, I guess I'm just a
bloody bastard, then, aren't I?

553
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,377
- What's the bad news now?

554
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,118
- Oh, no bad news.

555
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,989
And no more fighting.

556
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,514
Gideon, fire up the ship.

557
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,993
- If I do that,
life support capacity

558
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,517
will be reduced by half.

559
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,866
- You heard me, Gideon.

560
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,999
Turn on the fabricators
and turn on the heat.

561
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:28,178
I'm thinking s'mores,
maybe some hot cocoa.

562
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,397
- The captain's gone mad.

563
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,182
- She's not mad.
- She's right.

564
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,662
- I could go for a s'more.

565
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,359
- Look, Ray would want us
to have faith

566
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:36,665
that we will escape.

567
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,798
He wouldn't want us
cold and miserable.

568
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:42,758
So right now, we are going
to enjoy our time together.

569
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,194
Let's go.

570
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,936
- Finally.
- Let's get some music going.

571
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:54,683
- Who's gonna bring me food
if I'm stuck in here?

572
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,381
This is how I'm gonna die,
isn't it?

573
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:01,081
Without any books or laughter

574
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,779
in the basement
of a government building?

575
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:05,564
Whoa.

576
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:27,063
You're right.
I'm not alone.

577
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,065
I have you.

578
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:37,900
- I'm sorry you're stuck here
with me, little one.

579
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:41,425
Ah, you should be out there
in the woods, frolicking about.

580
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:45,342
Or whatever it is you Púcas
get up to these days.

581
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,085
You know, to tell you the truth,

582
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,740
I'm bloody well terrified.

583
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,655
- No.

584
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,615
It's not the eternity of torture

585
00:26:56,658 --> 00:27:00,183
or the people
who are after my head, no.

586
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:06,668
It's that I'll have to watch
Raymond and Astra

587
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,585
and all the others I've failed
be tortured along with me.

588
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,284
Even led the Legends
to their death.

589
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,288
And you're next in line.

590
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,290
- Yeah, that's right.

591
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,553
You sense the rottenness
inside me, don't you?

592
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:25,469
No better than the bloody king.

593
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,481
Why would you heal
a bastard like me?

594
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,705
- Up with you.

595
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,141
Time to see the king.

596
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,188
- All right, then, little one.

597
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,843
Let's go see what this party's
all about, shall we?

598
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:59,242
- We live in a world
of wonder and amazement.

599
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:04,639
At times, it's beautiful,
breathtaking.

600
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,730
At other times, cruel,
dangerous...

601
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,647
And monstrous.

602
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:21,830
Before you are two
foul creatures of the dark,

603
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,572
one a grotesque
woodland creature

604
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,574
that would not hesitate
to tear out your heart,

605
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,533
the other an imposter,

606
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,710
a wielder of the dark arts

607
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:36,845
that would usurp
my very body and soul.

608
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:41,023
Now, my people,
I seek your wisdom

609
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,417
in these matters.

610
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,987
What would you have me do
with such wretched beasts?

611
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,206
To hell! To hell!

612
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,906
To hell! To hell! To hell!

613
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,794
- We're very excited
for you to receive

614
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:14,230
your performance review.

615
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:18,278
- But what actually happens
at the meeting?

616
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,454
Feel free to give me
any spoilers.

617
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:25,372
- Don't worry.
- I had my doubts too.

618
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,809
But then I met with Gary
and realized

619
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,898
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

620
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:33,162
All: Gary Green
is all the man we need.

621
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,213
- Bye.

622
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:43,694
- Please step forward,
Ms. Wu.

623
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,308
Take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

624
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,574
Mint?

625
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,532
- Eh, no, thanks.

626
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,143
- Don't mind if I do.

627
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,713
Let's see.

628
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,150
Mm.

629
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,847
I see you've made
quite an impression

630
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,284
in your brief time here.

631
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:11,287
But lately you've been
slacking off.

632
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:16,815
It says right here
you've been very disloyal

633
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,904
to the Time Bureau.

634
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,819
- Not yet, Wolfie.

635
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,213
- Okay, I'll judge this round.

636
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:26,215
You and your team are stuck
in a trash compactor

637
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,175
in an impromptu and possibly
fatal homage to "Star Wars."

638
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,350
What do you do?

639
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:33,701
- Boom, that's the one.

640
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,659
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Yep.

641
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,052
- Ooh, gonna have to go with,

642
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,924
"Steel up as Sara
scales a wall."

643
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,448
- Another point for me.
- Favoritism!

644
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,406
- Why would I display
favoritism?

645
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,887
- 'Cause you two
are obviously shagging.

646
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,454
- What?
- Hmm?

647
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,151
Yeah.

648
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:52,981
- Yes, finally!
- This is great.

649
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,504
Maybe you guys
won't be so weird now.

650
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:57,159
Okay, I'll judge next.

651
00:30:57,203 --> 00:31:01,468
A teammate turns on you,
lost to the dark side.

652
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,686
What do you do?

653
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,865
- Mm.

654
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,087
- "Escape via musical number."

655
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,393
Not this time.

656
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,526
"Fabricate eveningwear
and infiltrate a party."

657
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,877
You guys know I love
a good party sneak.

658
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,401
"Don't give up on each other.
Work together.

659
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,012
You're more than a team.
You are a family."

660
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,018
- Well, I guess that card's
the winner, then.

661
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:32,020
Point to Charlie.
I'm on the board.

662
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,764
- The hell was that?
- Due to your reckless use

663
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,374
of our rapidly depleting energy,

664
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,028
internal temperature
of the ship has melted

665
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,683
the surrounding ice enough
to shake the ship loose.

666
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,771
- What do we do?

667
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:45,207
- We work as a team.

668
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,601
Zari, engine room.
Get the thrusters back online.

669
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,733
Seal the cargo bay.
You two with me.

670
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,524
- My dear people!

671
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,919
I hear your cries
and feel your anger.

672
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,399
And therefore, by your command,

673
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,662
I send these creatures

674
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,099
where they belong.

675
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,143
Straight to hell!

676
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:10,798
Straight to hell!
Straight to hell!

677
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,409
Straight to hell!
Straight to hell!

678
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,732
Begone, you unclean beasts!

679
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:43,613
- Come on, Johnny.
- You know what you need to do.

680
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:46,965
- Oh, bollocks.

681
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:05,113
Here. Run, run.

682
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,857
- What have you done?

683
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,120
- I've used your own magic
against you.

684
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:23,392
We may be kin,
but we are not the same.

685
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:32,314
Now, you may not agree
with my methods,

686
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,839
but I will always
protect my people.

687
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:57,122
- Now, the question is,
Ms. Wu,

688
00:33:57,165 --> 00:34:00,560
what shall we do
about your disloyalty?

689
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,519
- Uh, maybe...

690
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:06,566
I lose my snack room
privileges for a week.

691
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,742
Oh, no!
Not my almonds!

692
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:12,137
- Oh, I wouldn't worry
about your almonds.

693
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,313
Because as I'm sure
you've heard,

694
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,359
Gary Green
is all the man you need.

695
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:21,189
Now, gaze into the nipple.

696
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:29,067
Wolfie!
Now!

697
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,720
- What's a Wolfie?

698
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,466
- W-W-W-Wolfie?

699
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,387
Bravo.

700
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:47,781
I knew you could exploit fear
to make yourself

701
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,130
even more powerful.

702
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,784
- Well, it looks like
you taught this old dog

703
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,742
some new tricks after all.

704
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,963
But now I'm gonna use those
new tricks to strike you down.

705
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,140
- You know, I do have
a few tricks of my own.

706
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,843
- We're running on very low
reserve power.

707
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,758
The odds of us successfully
pushing through the avalanche

708
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:11,152
above us are 3,720 to 1.

709
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,023
- Never tell me the odds,
Gideon.

710
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,677
Everyone hold on tight.

711
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,201
- Oh, this better work.

712
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,376
- It will.

713
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,032
- You got Wicksty?
- Yeah, I'm not letting go.

714
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,518
- Come on, come on.

715
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,220
- Boom!
- Whoo!

716
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,612
- Yes!

717
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,136
- All systems are back online,
Captain.

718
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,398
- Fantastic, Gideon.

719
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:42,444
Now let's go find
Constantine and Ray.

720
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,847
Oh, damn executive
privacy button.

721
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,675
Uh, hey.

722
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,981
Can you do me a solid and press
that button over there,

723
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,157
if you...

724
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,204
Do you really think I'm letting
you get out of here alive?

725
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:06,642
- Help!

726
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,429
- Get away from him, you beast!

727
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,007
- What happened?

728
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,140
- I don't know.

729
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,188
But I'm guessing he had
something to do with it.

730
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,259
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

731
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,305
- It may be too late to save Ray

732
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:03,264
or Desmond or the Legends.

733
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,049
But at least I'll get to send
you back where you belong.

734
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:14,797
Oh, you bastards.
You did it.

735
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,234
You bloody survived.

736
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,237
I've never been so happy
to be wrong in my life.

737
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,064
- Don't do it, John.
- Don't kill him.

738
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,371
- Don't give up on Haircut.

739
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,373
- What are you gonna do, Johnny?

740
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,896
You're all out of moves.

741
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,294
- No, I'm not.

742
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,301
I'll see you lovely lot
at the end.

743
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,042
I'm gonna save Ray.

744
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,614
- John!

745
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,729
- The magic-o-meter's
picking up

746
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,252
strange activity on the ground.

747
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,562
- Tabitha, show yourself.

748
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,785
Ah.

749
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,701
- So wonderful to be back.

750
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:35,487
Brimstone was so awful
for my complexion.

751
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,532
- Oh, but you look ravishing,
my love.

752
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,407
- Hold on.
- Is he kissing...

753
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,409
- Oh, the Fairy Godmother.

754
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:46,236
- Is that tongue?

755
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,151
- More singing.

756
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,066
- We're so screwed.

757
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,462
- Come with me, my pet.

758
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,464
Let's find you a new host.

759
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,467
- It's his nipple.

760
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,993
He tried to hypnotize Mona
with his nipple.

761
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,476
- His nipple?

762
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,436
Neron gave you back your nipple
which became bad in hell,

763
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,873
which is now poisoning
your mind and making you evil,

764
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,831
and that's why you came back
to the Time Bureau...

765
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,833
So that you could
nip-notize everyone

766
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,619
- and Neron could take over.
- Yeah.

767
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:23,665
- You will do no more harm
with your nipple!

768
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:28,191
- No, no, no, no!

769
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,671
No, no, please no!

770
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:39,202
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,769
It wasn't me.
It was my nipple.

772
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:41,770
I swear.

773
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,385
- Save me!

774
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,864
- As you wish.

775
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,526
- You have to go.

776
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,049
Tell the Legends
what's going on.

777
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,530
- Wait, what about you?
- I'm not leaving Mona behind.

778
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:03,966
- Always knew you were
a team player.

779
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,277
- Ava.
- You okay?

780
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,410
- It's a long story,
but Gary took over the Bureau.

781
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,846
He nip-notized everyone.

782
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,413
- Yeah, you're gonna have
to explain that.

783
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,066
- The germ turned.

784
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,068
- Well, it's not just him.
- It's Neron and...

785
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:20,896
- The Fairy Godmother, Tabitha.

786
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,071
- She's Tabitha?

787
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,725
- Yeah, you missed a lot.

788
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,205
- And Ray is still in hell.

789
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:26,424
I know he hasn't given up,

790
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,034
so we're not gonna
give up on him.

791
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:29,862
Now, let's do this...

792
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,559
for Ray.

793
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:07,682
Bloody hell.

794
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,411
- Greg, move your head.
