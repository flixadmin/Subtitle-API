You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

The fact of the matter
is we're halfway into the first shift

483
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:24,631
since the race ended and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

You inspired them to work harder!

485
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,843
Sentinel Prime, sir,

486
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:33,139
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

487
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,058
That we bots can do more than just mine...

488
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,394
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

489
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,146
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,

490
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,499
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

[LAUGHS] Wow! Okay, great.

I am so sorry. That must

I just haven't had a lot of company

00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,624
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

Fifty? But there are only 40 sublevels.

That's what I thought!

Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

but I kept getting reassigned

to the waste management area,

but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.
