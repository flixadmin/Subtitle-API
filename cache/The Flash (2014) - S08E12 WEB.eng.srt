00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,869
A few weeks ago,
I gave Captain Kramer

169
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,784
an emergency alert
to summon the Flash,

170
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,438
and this is the first time
she's used it,

171
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,179
which means--
- It's serious.

172
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,833
As in 'gotta go" serious.

173
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,183
Yeah, but, Iris,
I can't leave you here alone.

174
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:12,274
Hey, she won't be.

175
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,928
Yeah, no, it's okay.

that's happening

178
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,585
and now with Deathstorm,

179
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,108
people need you more than ever.

180
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,676
Go.

181
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,163
Yeah, I get it.

Glad to have you

So why is this thing
burning people alive?

215
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,198
We're not sure,
but the current theory ism

One thing I do know
about Team Flash is,

220
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,469
they'll find a way.

221
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,949
I don't know
what's more terrifying,

222
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,778
that this Deathstorm can
turn up anywhere,

223

or that not even the Flash is
powerful enough to stop him.

Well, Kristen,
I know this seems hopeless--

No, it's not just that.

Joe, how the hell did you
used to deal with this?

227
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,180
For the past 17 years,

228
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,139
I've been either a soldier
or a cop,

229
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,620
and nothing I've done
prepared me for this.

230
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,665
Look, I hear you--
when I was captain,

231
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,189
I fought evils in this town
I didn't know existed,

232
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,017
so I know
exactly where you are.

at something
that you cannot stop.

235
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:35,286
But I always had
a friend to watch my back,

236
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,549
just like you do now.

237
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,900
Joe's right.
Everyone has a weakness.

238
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:41,423
Deathstorm does too.

239
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,425
We just have to find it.

240
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,079
Until then, what's the plan?

241
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,081
I'll use my speed
to keep searching the city.

242
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,257
I can help you
coordinate protocols

243
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,259
so all of our officers are safe

244
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,870
and they can actually
do their job.

245
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,655
What are you,
my advisor now, Joe?

246

That would be up to you, Captain.

247
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,268
Remember,
if you or any of your officers

248
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,965
see this thing--
- Don't worry.

249
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,925
You'll be the first to know.

250
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,796
I'll let you know
what I find on my end.

Until he does,

254
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,980
you and I have to lock down
this city.

255

Let's get to work.

256
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,028
Listen up, everyone.

257
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,770
Our city is under attack.

258
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,468
Captain, is it true?
Some kind of fire ghost?

259
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:29,210
Yes, and I suppose that's
as good a description as any.

260
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,474
To be honest, we don't know
much about our enemy,

261
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,824
but I can confirm
that the streets aren't safe

262
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,478
for anyone who is
currently grieving.

263
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,959
So if you've had
any upsetting news recently

264
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,439
about a family member,
friend, or loved one,

265
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,181
please see myself
or Joe immediately.

266
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,140
You're not safe on the streets.

267
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,620
The rest of us will be working
with the Flash and his team

268
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,622
to take this threat down together.

269
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,712
So your orders are as follows:

270
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,279
do not engage this monster.

271
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:56,846
We need to protect this city

272
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,370
by keeping civilians
out of harm's way.

273
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,764
The Flash and his team
will do the heavy lifting.

274
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,333
Now, Martinez, Howe, send out
a city-wide lockdown alert.

275
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,161
We need everyone
off the streets.

276
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:10,338
Korber, Matlin, gather teams
to set up a perimeter grid.

277
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,948
I want eyes and ears

278
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:13,689
on every street corner
we can manage.

279
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,909
Anyone sees this thing,
call it in,

280
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,258
then get yourselves to safety.

281
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,391
I have looked through
all the evidence

282
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,828
on Deathstorm's past attacks,

283
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,787
and still no clues
as to where he went.

284
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,876
So far, every grid has
turned up nothing.

285
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,618
And satellites are
still a dead end.

286
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,055
Hey, what about
the CCC Media tip line?

287
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,623
Nothing yet, and I have
the bullpen on alert.

288
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,669
It's like he shows up
just to feed

289
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,715
and then disappears
into thin air.

290
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,891
Just like a ghost.

291
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,153
He's not a ghost,

292
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,809
so he's gotta be
hiding somewhere.

the real thing.

Frost and Deathstorm's powers
are both based on cold fusion.

817
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,436
That could be the key
to pull this whole thing off.

Yeah, but Frost,
this is right up there

We can't ask you to do this.

You don't have to.

It's like I told Mom.
Dad created me for one reason.

824
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,320
To keep Caity safe.

825
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:12,975
I was literally born for this.
