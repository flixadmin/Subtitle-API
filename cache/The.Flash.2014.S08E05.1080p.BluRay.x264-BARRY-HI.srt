1
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,050
Of course I'm really here. Barr.

2
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,553
You're sounding kinda strange.
Are you okay?

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:11,721
[whooshing]

4
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,350
I am now. Yeah.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,561
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,355
Okay.

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,609
You wanna tell me
what's really going on?'

8
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:26,611
You don't remember either.

9
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:31,365
Thawne.

10
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:33,784
He...

11
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,288
He changed things.
Made me think I was crazy.

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,040
He took away my life.

13
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,376
Piece by piece, until I lost everything.

14
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,922
Thawne started his own
Reverse-Flashpoint.

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,925
Joe, you died.

16
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,634
Uh...

17
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,886
Well,

18
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,348
I'm so sorry...

19
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,184
you went through that.

20
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,645
Hey. Listen to me.

21
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,855
I'm here now

22
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,394
and I'm not going anywhere.

23
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,193
I know it's...

24
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:11,155
Seeing you again,
after everything that's happened.

25
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:13,574
[chuckles]

26
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,452
It's just like
I can finally breathe again.

27
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,581
[Damien] Nothing like
a second shot at life.

28
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,575
Barry, why is there a super villain
standing in my living room?

29
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,409
Thank you.

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,078
But I'm not here to cause trouble.

31
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,705
Damien, how are you still here?

32
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,290
[Damien] I don't know. My theory,

33
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,834
I was connected
to the Time Stone you were wearing.

34
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,755
When you created a portal,
it drew me to 2021 also.

35
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,257
Although I haven't faded yet.

36
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,508
I'm sure, I soon will.

37
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,386
- Once you do?
- I die.

38
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,431
But my daughter Nora lives.

39
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,975
Only that hasn't happened yet
and I don't know why.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,978
Maybe if I had the Time Stone.

41
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,525
That was handy.

42
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,362
- Damien, what you're doing now...
- I'm no hero, Barry.

43
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,615
I'm just a dad.

44
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,336
Freeze!

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,630
You are under arrest!

46
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:52,882
For what, officers?

47
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,385
I haven't even done anything.

48
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,387
Yet.

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,972
Do you want to know why?

50
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,394
Because I'm not ready to die yet!

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,833
I can't believe everything
that you went through.

52
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,943
I mean, these last few days
have been so...

53
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,443
normal.

54
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,821
Boring even.

55
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,782
I mean, I'm glad nobody remembers.

56
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,535
And Frost and Chillblaine were married?

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,745
- Apparently.
- That's insane.

58
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,997
What about Chuck and me?
What were we doing?

59
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,041
I mean same as now, I guess.

60
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,544
I don't know.
I mean, we weren't really teammates

61
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,670
in that other timeline.

62
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,589
I do know Chester helped build
the energy absorption tech

63
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,007
that saved the world. Hold on.

64
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,384
[whooshing]

65
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,009
Here you go.

66
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,972
Holy Ron Mallets!

67
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,849
Circuitry is next level.

68
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,559
Okay, nice work, future me.

69
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,269
But is it okay that I have this?

70
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,813
I don't want to start like,
a Chester-P-point.

71
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,774
I mean, maybe just don't
talk about it on your podcast.

72
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,609
Got you.

73
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,946
Well, Barr, you risked everything
to prevent Armageddon

74
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,699
and gave all of us a second chance.

75
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,286
And we're really damn grateful.
Especially me.

76
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,245
Ditto.

77
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,040
You really are a true hero, Barry.

78
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,585
[phone chimes]

79
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,296
It's Taylor with a news alert.

80
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,214
Thawne is at C.C.P.D.

81
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,097
Ah-ah.

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,892
I know what you're thinking.

83
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,687
You're thinking, why did I do that?

84
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:34,066
Well, I did it to draw out your hero.

85
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,529
What is taking him... so long?

86
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,614
[Mia] You want a hero?

87
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,419
You?

88
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,757
You know, normally...

89
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:01,803
I'd be intrigued
to meet the great Green Arrow,

90
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,180
but unfortunately, today...

91
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,390
I don't have the time.

92
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,724
Where's William?

93
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,727
- Who is William?
- Wrong answer.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Oopsie.

95
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,233
That's a temporal fade, pal.

96
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,142
Looks like you're not too much longer
for this timeline.

97
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:19,903
Too bad.

98
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,196
Now.

99
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,949
Where the hell's my brother?

100
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,159
Enough with the questions.

101
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,164
Sorry, kid.

102
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,585
I don't have time for family drama.

103
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,804
Stay down, Thawne.

104
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,139
Flash.

105
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,065
I didn't come here to fight.

106
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:03,656
I came here to make a scene publicly!
So that there would be witnesses

107
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,325
for what I have to ask you.

108
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,701
What is it?

109
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,663
I need you to save me.

110
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,386
So Thawne messed with the timeline?

111
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,389
No wonder
I picked up on his temporal energy.

112
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,557
He must be loaded with it.

113
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,434
Is that why you're here in 2021?

114
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,020
No. I tracked Thawne's scent by mistake.

115
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,022
I was looking for something else.

116
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,773
Maybe we can help?

117
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,943
I'm Chester P, by the way.
New guy. [chuckles]

118
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,613
And it is so cool to meet
the future Green Arrow.

119
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,239
Mia Queen!

120
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,451
Progeny of Felicity Smoak
and Oliver Queen.

121
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,036
I know all the stories.

122
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,871
Not all the stories.

123
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,291
Look, what did Thawne mean
when he said, "Save me"?

124
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,876
Save him from what?

125
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,296
You see how he's... fading in and out.

126
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,691
Same thing happened to me
in his Reverse-Flashpoint.

127
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,716
He's being erased.

128
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,345
Once the process is complete, he'll die.

129
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,767
So when you removed Thawne's changes,
the timeline decided to remove him, too.

130
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,100
Yeah.

131
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,563
Okay, but when Thawne died,
he came back somehow after Eddie.

132
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:18,981
I mean, could that happen again?

133
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,691
No, this is different.

134
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,903
When I reset the timeline,
I used Damien's Time Stone.

135
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,489
It eliminated
all possible time variables,

136
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,200
restoring a single,
permanent timeline again.

137
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,411
- This one.
- So if he dies this time...

138
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,246
It's game over for good.

139
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,332
Okay. I need to call Frost.

140
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,809
If we're going to decide
what to do about Thawne,

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,953
we need the whole team here.

142
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,546
Wait a minute. You're not actually
considering saving him, are you?

143
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:45,901
Mia, we know that Thawne is bad,
but we still need to talk this through

144
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,385
before we make any decisions.

145
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:49,928
Fine.

146
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,973
If that's how you guys do things.

147
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,517
But you're making a big mistake.

148
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,730
I will go talk to her.

149
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,681
You see if you can find out
how much time Thawne has left.

150
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,924
You want something?

151
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,801
Mia.

152
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,889
You never said why you came to 2021.
But I'm guessing it's important.

153
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,056
So...

154
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,434
what is going on?

155
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,187
I'm here to find my brother.

156
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:42,939
William's missing.

157
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,901
I just hit another dead end.

158
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,529
What happened?

159
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,656
[sighs]

160
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,662
It was the night
I decided to put on the suit.

161
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,128
<i>William and I went to see Dad's statue.</i>

162
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,211
<i>But...</i>

163
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,672
<i>we were attacked.</i>

164
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,634
<i>I haven't seen my brother since.</i>

165
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,305
I've been looking for him for two years.

166
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,390
I'm so sorry.

167
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,853
Found a temporal energy signature
at the crime scene which led me here

168
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,023
but, every trail goes cold.

169
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,278
Now this is all I have left of him.

170
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,281
William gave it to me the night
he was taken.

171
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,493
Sometimes I wonder if it's connected
to why he's still gone.

172
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,495
Have you asked Felicity for help?

173
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,414
She wouldn't understand
what I've had to do to get this far.

174
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,083
What is that supposed to mean?

175
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:44,959
Mia, have you...

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,004
Killed anyone?

177
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,214
I will if I have to.

178
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,132
For William's sake.

179
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,262
Sometimes blood for blood
is the answer.

180
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,431
You know, your dad thought
the same thing once.

181
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,144
That in order to protect his city,
he had to take lives.

182
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,730
But all he ended up doing
was ruining his own.

183
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,982
I think you know that.

184
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,195
Or else you wouldn't be
so afraid to go see your mom.

185
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:12,905
You're the one who's afraid.

186
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,282
Thawne killed your dad,

187
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,993
and then tricked you
into almost marrying him.

188
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,080
All the while making you believe
you had a choice in it all.

189
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,123
You.

190
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,668
Iris West-Frakkin' Allen.

191
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,338
And now you're too afraid
to give him what he deserves.

192
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,842
You think my life will be ruined
if I kill?

193
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,595
What about yours if you don't?

194
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,892
Because it sounds like you'd be
a lot better off if he was gone.

195
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,906
How much longer do I have?

196
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,782
Best I can tell...

197
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,576
Two hours.

198
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,204
And then you'll fade away.

199
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,249
Two hours until you save me. Right?

200
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,084
Caitlin, because you...

201
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,254
Barry and Team Flash,

202
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,047
you are the good guys.

203
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:13,966
You'll do the right thing.

204
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,885
Some of us might surprise you.

205
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,679
But not you, you're a doctor.
You won't kill me.

206
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,599
No, I won't.

207
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,769
But I can accept it when someone dies.

208
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,187
Is that right?

209
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,899
Maybe you forget?

210
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,985
I know the real Caitlin Snow.

211
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,864
You're right where you were,
eight years ago. Remember?

212
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,200
Living your safe...

213
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,036
orderly life.

214
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,663
Preparing for a perfect future.

215
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,917
With your idiot fiancé.

216
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,170
And then...

217
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,421
[exclaims]

218
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,052
It all came crashing down.

219
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,221
What is wrong with you?

220
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,476
Ronnie was my whole future
and he is never coming back.

221
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,894
He's never coming back.

222
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,646
That's what happens. What about you?

223
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,398
You could have moved on.

224
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,109
I mean, you should have moved on.

225
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,196
But instead, you're stuck here
where you were eight years ago

226
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:22,201
helping Team Flash and Barry Allen
instead of getting on with your life.

227
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,327
Fine.

228
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,955
You want honesty?

229
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,043
When I was a resident,
fresh out of med school,

230
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,045
one of the first things
they taught me...

231
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,508
is that sometimes you lose a patient.

232
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,637
That death is a part of life.

233
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,223
So guess what?

234
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,059
It's your turn.

235
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,189
Because all the speed in the world

236
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,651
can't help you out run
what's coming for you.

237
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:00,364
You'll save me, you'll save me, Snow.
You don't have a choice.

238
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,367
And another thing.

239
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,122
I stayed here because Barry
and the rest of the team,

240
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,001
they're not just friends,
they're family.

241
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,004
And just so we're clear...

242
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,591
What I've been doing
for the last eight years...

243
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,386
is hating you.

244
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,100
So if you're looking for someone
to save you,

245
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,729
look somewhere else.

246
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,535
You okay?

247
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,371
What happened?

248
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,709
We need to let Thawne die.

249
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,856
Caitlin told me about your talk.

250
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,359
Something I want to know.

251
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,113
Why did you create a Reverse-Flashpoint
to steal my life?

252
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,530
Why?

253
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,701
That was the best way to hurt you.

254
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:32,247
Don't you have anything better to do
than trying to destroy my life?

255
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,707
Destroying you is my life.

256
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,375
[groans]

257
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,503
That still doesn't explain why.

258
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,753
Why what?

259
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,839
What did I ever do to you?

260
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,388
Almost two centuries...

261
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,973
from right now,

262
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,060
we meet

263
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,230
for the very first time.

264
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,649
For my part,

265
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,861
I finally discovered ways
to possess speeds,

266
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,447
speeds faster than anyone alive.

267
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:10,786
And, just as I was about
to present myself to the world...

268
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:14,831
you showed up.

269
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,545
In pursuit of some stupid case
and dazzled the crowd.

270
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,005
You were dazzling. And then...

271
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,175
and then you saved the crowd.

272
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,683
A crowd that I was meant to save,
a crowd that was meant to thank me,

273
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,686
you stole... my greatest moment.

274
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,062
I admired you.

275
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,859
And you humiliated me.

276
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,073
And it was in that moment,
I knew I had to get faster than you.

277
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,746
Only a sociopath...
would react to something so small

278
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,915
with that kind of rage.

279
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,835
What you call rage...

280
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,798
I call commitment.

281
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,510
So if you won't stop hating me,

282
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,056
what happens once I save you?

283
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,893
I'll just go on with my life's work.

284
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,980
Finding new ways to kill you.

285
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,824
[Human Despero] You know
what to do, Flash.

286
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,243
What are you doing here?

287
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,455
I went to the future to see
for myself.

288
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,540
Whether or not Armageddon
had been prevented.

289
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,624
Then you know that it was.

290
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,795
Yes, but I also witnessed
the return of your rival.

291
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,547
You must know
as long as Eobard Thawne lives,

292
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,050
he can still bring about
another Armageddon.

293
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,468
So what do you want me to do?

294
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,594
Listen to your friend.

295
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,720
Let him die.

296
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,443
If you want him dead so much,
why don't you just kill him yourself?

297
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,560
I would, but he could come back,
as he did before.

298
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:03,190
This is the only way
to assure his absolute death.

299
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,071
You know it's the right thing to do,
Flash.

300
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,162
[Chester] You can't be serious.

301
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,373
You can't just let Thawne die.

302
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,543
I gave him a chance
to prove he can change.

303
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,794
He can't.

304
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,798
So, what? We just kill him?

305
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,552
Thawne messed with the timeline
and now the timeline is fighting back.

306
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,177
I say we let it.

307
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,804
Me, too.

308
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,350
Look, Thawne did this to himself.

309
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,313
And it's not like we can save him so...
it's time to let him go.

310
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:48,527
Look, I know that we're the new kids
and we don't have the same history

311
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,445
with Thawne. But that's a good thing

312
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,241
because I don't care who Thawne is,
I care who you guys are.

313
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,243
And you save people.

314
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,704
I know because you saved me.

315
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,872
And me. Literally.

316
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,125
You're right. You are the new kids.

317
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,253
And so when it comes to Thawne,
I'm sorry, but you don't get a say.

318
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,171
Iris.

319
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,967
Maybe we should think about this.

320
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,050
We already have.

321
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,555
You guys don't understand
what Thawne is capable of.

322
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,183
It's time to keep everyone safe
by finally letting Thawne die.

323
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,519
Barry. Iris.

324
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:24,729
We need to talk.

325
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:26,897
Now.

326
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:28,816
Yeah.

327
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,239
What the hell is wrong with you two?

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,867
Since when do we let people die?

329
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:38,452
Dad, you know who Thawne is.

330
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,620
Yeah, I do.

331
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,457
And that man came to you for help
which means you're obligated to try

332
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,456
and save him.

333
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,626
Joe, he killed you.

334
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,919
No. I know you don't remember, but I do.

335
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,714
If we don't let this happen now,
our family will never be safe.

336
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,841
You don't think I want
to see him dead either?

337
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,383
Because I do.

338
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,137
If I learned one thing, being a cop

339
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,931
is that you can't just protect
the people you think are good.

340
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,933
You have to protect everyone.

341
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,727
That's what heroes do.

342
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,520
- I know that.
- Do you?

343
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:10,734
A hero is not just in the name,
Barry, or in a red suit.

344
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,863
It's a choice that we make to decide
who and what we become.

345
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,697
You know that.

346
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,076
Dad, we don't have a choice.
Thawne isn't giving us one.

347
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,411
You always have a choice!

348
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,412
[sighs]

349
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,541
Now have either one of you

350
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,671
even tried, to think
of a way to save him?

351
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,341
You already found one.

352
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,345
Yeah.

353
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,724
We could save him
if we take his speed away.

354
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,850
Permanently.

355
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,937
Just like Jefferson Pierce did to you.

356
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,771
[thudding]

357
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,315
- Listen, Joe, wait.
- Hey.

358
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,774
Uh-uh.

359
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,736
This decision is for the two of you.

360
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,864
But I can tell you one thing.
If you let Thawne die,

361
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,409
you don't have to worry
about him destroying our family.

362
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,000
We have to talk to Caitlin.

363
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,711
Yeah.

364
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,261
[Alien Despero] <i>The heroes
of this world have failed.</i>

365
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,514
<i>But if they won't end
Thawne's existence,</i>

366
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:27,060
<i>then I, Despero,
will take matters into my own hands.</i>

367
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,231
<i>Mia Queen.</i>

368
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,483
<i>Mia Queen...</i>

369
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,070
<i>Mia Queen.</i>

370
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,197
<i>And you're gonna help me.</i>

371
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,668
Barry, are you sure?

372
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,714
Yeah. Look, if we're really heroes,

373
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,301
we can't turn our back on anyone,
including Thawne.

374
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,803
So you want to take away his speed
to save his life?

375
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,056
All right. What if it doesn't work?

376
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,100
It will. Before the timeline reset,

377
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,144
Jefferson hit me
with enough continuous voltage

378
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,147
to nearly sever my connection
to the Speed Force.

379
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,355
Like blowing a fuse.

380
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,274
And you want to do
the same thing to Thawne.

381
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,861
And once his speed is gone,
A.R.G.U.S. will take him into custody.

382
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,233
We've already called Cisco.

383
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,157
Jail time won't make up
for all the lives he destroyed.

384
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:27,454
Look, you're right. But we can't
let Thawne change who we are.

385
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,749
[whooshing]

386
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,208
You're a fool.

387
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,378
Thawne must be erased from time itself.

388
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,797
Why can't you see that?

389
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,882
Despero, without his speed,

390
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,842
Thawne won't be a threat
to anyone ever again.

391
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,928
Thawne recovered his powers before.

392
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,305
This is your final warning, Flash.

393
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,351
Stand down and let Thawne die
or suffer the consequences.

394
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,103
No.

395
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,983
Barry!

396
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,655
[Alien Despero]
It's not too late, Flash!

397
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,075
Let Thawne die, so Armageddon can end.

398
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,173
Light up, Allegra,
we're going after Flash.

399
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,163
[Iris West]
No, Barry can handle Despero.

400
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,082
You two protect Thawne.
No matter what.

401
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,643
- You sure, boss?
- [Iris West] Yeah.

402
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,794
If Despero attacks us, too,
we need to be ready.

403
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,213
[sighs]

404
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,382
What if Despero kills Barry?

405
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,276
I mean, they've fought before
and it wasn't exactly close.

406
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,740
Let's hope it goes better this time.

407
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,429
[screeching loudly]

408
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,390
[both groan]

409
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,272
[Alien Despero] I was right about you
all along, Flash.

410
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,691
You are humanity's enemy.

411
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,403
I'm choosing to save a life, Despero,
not end one.

412
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,406
That's what heroes do.

413
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,243
But you've never been a hero, have you?

414
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,245
[Alien Despero] What are you implying?

415
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,082
What you told me about your home-world.

416
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,042
That was all a lie, wasn't it?

417
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,840
You weren't the heroic rebel leader.
You were the despot.

418
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,968
The one who inflicted
pain and suffering,

419
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,264
who killed to get what he wanted.

420
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,308
[Alien Despero]
I did what was necessary.

421
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,433
No, you're wrong.

422
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,855
You've been wrong this whole time
about everything.

423
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,442
You're no hero, Despero.

424
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,236
You're just like Thawne.

425
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,572
[Alien Despero]
Only in your eyes, Flash.

426
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,491
Because I know what must be done.

427
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:34,122
The greater good that must be embraced
in order for this world to survive.

428
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,710
All that remains is for me to show you.

429
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,594
Chester, secure S.T.A.R. Labs.

430
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,514
Frak, we just lost power.

431
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,724
What about Thawne?

432
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,224
That's what's so weird.

433
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,687
Backup system just kicked in,
but only for the force field trap.

434
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,856
What? No, no,
that doesn't make any sense unless...

435
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,941
It's Despero.

436
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,191
We're under attack.

437
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,244
[groans]

438
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,167
Mia! What the hell, girl?

439
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,087
[Alien Despero] Iris West-Allen.

440
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,882
You and Flash made this decision.

441
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,636
And now you'll die for making
the wrong one.

442
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Mia, listen to me.

443
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,263
This isn't you.

444
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,639
Mia.

445
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,393
Mia, she's right.

446
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,811
Take my power.

447
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,980
Take my strength. Fight him.

448
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:23,815
Empath!

449
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:28,236
You think I'd release
this perfect vessel?

450
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,571
Mia, stop.

451
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,199
I know you can fight this.

452
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,911
The child is gone, human.

453
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,035
[Iris West] No, she's not.

454
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,363
Mia, I know you can fight this
because you already have.

455
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,709
Look around.
You could have killed us but you didn't.

456
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,796
Mia, she's right.

457
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,465
Fight him.

458
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,431
Impossible!

459
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,524
Mia, think about William.

460
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,862
Is this the path
that he would want you to choose?

461
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,701
[high-pitched noise ringing]

462
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,912
[groaning]

463
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,044
Iris.

464
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:32,133
Allegra and Frost, in the hallway.

465
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,426
I'll go check on them.

466
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,054
I'm so sorry.

467
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,559
My pawn failed.

468
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,353
Your friend survived.

469
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,645
Mia?

470
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,398
What did you do?

471
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,110
Nothing compared
to what I'm going to do now.

472
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,071
I told you Thawne must die and he will.

473
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,282
That's why I'm taking matters
into my own hands.

474
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,410
I'm going to be the hero
that this world needs, Flash.

475
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,163
Not you!

476
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,335
Barry, are you okay?

477
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,920
Yeah, I think so.

478
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:10,505
What's going on?

479
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,650
I've got the secondary power circuits
up and running,

480
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,051
but I'm picking up insane
energy readings out there.

481
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,762
I'm talking like
atomic bomb level readings.

482
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:18,846
It's Despero.

483
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,945
He must be willing to wipe out
the whole city to get what he wants.

484
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,309
He's going to kill us all.

485
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,270
Just so Thawne will die.

486
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:46,874
How's Mia?

487
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,751
She's resting.
Frost is keeping an eye on her.

488
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,646
Thank goodness Iris got through
to her before she...

489
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,839
Right. But what in the world
are we supposed to do now?

490
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,175
We beat Despero to the punch.

491
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,510
We whammy Thawne's speed right now,

492
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,263
make him a permanent jaywalker
before Despero whammies us.

493
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,436
It's okay, Cecile.
We all decided it together.

494
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,646
Chester, where are we with...

495
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,649
Project Whammy? I still have to finish
calibrating your suit.

496
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:14,027
Well, how much time do we have
before the timeline resets?

497
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,778
A few minutes, maybe less.

498
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,822
And only if Despero
doesn't wipe us out first.

499
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,244
Look, we're not losing today.

500
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,788
Not our city. Not a single life.

501
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,766
I don't know how,
but there's got to be a way

502
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,852
to stop Despero long enough
for Chuck to do his thing.

503
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,920
So come on, we're team Flash.

504
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,545
What can we do?

505
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,342
The energy Despero's harnessing
is from his home world, Kalanor.

506
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,345
But, I mean, even if
the energy is alien,

507
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,014
the Flame of Py'tar is still a flame.

508
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,391
You can harness it with a vacuum.

509
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,559
And then disperse it.

510
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:50,563
But I'd still need a way to direct
all that energy into the atmosphere.

511
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,024
Wait. If a delivery system
is what you need,

512
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,275
then I got the ticket.

513
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,611
Okay, so you know how
the P.E.D. redirects energy?

514
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:01,115
Turns out the materials in that puppy
are damn versatile.

515
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:07,330
So I took the liberty of using them
to make these.

516
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,961
[gasps] No way. Chuck, you're amazing.

517
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,046
Yeah, I can work with these.

518
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,565
They're a perfect fit, Chester.

519
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,610
[Chester] <i>Thanks. Now run, boss. Run.</i>

520
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,742
Now, Flash, your city dies

521
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,329
so that this planet's future
may survive.

522
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,115
[screams] No!

523
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,092
It's gone,

524
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,929
my connection to the flame.

525
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,475
Damn you, Flash.

526
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,060
It's over, Despero.

527
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,399
Flash, you've no idea what you've done.

528
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,071
I swear by the moons of Kalanor,
you'll pay for this.

529
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,407
This whole planet will.

530
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,285
[screams]

531
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,598
[Chester] <i>Flash, we've got
less than 30 seconds to save Thawne</i>

532
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:13,998
<i>before the timeline resets.</i>

533
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,842
All right. Get ready, Chester,
I'm on my way.

534
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,257
My speed.

535
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:26,928
I need more time.

536
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,429
We're out of time, Thawne.

537
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:30,890
Calibration complete.

538
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,265
Go for it.

539
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,684
On my mark, lower the shield.

540
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,315
Now.

541
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,110
[screams]

542
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,759
There is no trace of the Negative
Speed Force left in your body.

543
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,762
Barry, you did it.

544
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,597
[pants]

545
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:16,185
What exactly do you think you've done?

546
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,104
We just saved your life, Thawne.

547
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,481
Don't make us regret it.

548
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,236
You think you saved my life?

549
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,072
You took my speed.

550
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,241
My speed is my life.

551
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,118
You took my life!

552
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,497
And left me in hell.

553
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,267
Now this is epic. Epic.

554
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,809
Wow!

555
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,855
I don't know what's more impressive,
this place or us.

556
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:01,981
Us. Definitely.

557
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,067
I haven't been to a place this swank
since my debutante days.

558
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,033
Well, we've got the place
to ourselves tonight.

559
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,031
And since Thawne's at A.R.G.U.S.
and Despero is finally gone...

560
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,199
For good, it seems like.

561
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,700
I figured we deserved a night off.

562
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,579
Look, about me going evil
and trying to kill you all, I...

563
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,788
Already forgiven.

564
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,041
We're just glad to have
the real Mia back.

565
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,711
And that, beautiful people,
is it for shop talk.

566
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:24,794
Yes, absolutely.

567
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,955
I think we've had enough of aliens
and evil speedsters.

568
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,176
Does that go for evil magicians,
too?

569
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,889
I know what you did
to Laurel Lance, Damien Darhk.

570
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,308
How about I return the favor?

571
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,061
By all means, go for it.

572
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,105
I thought I'd be
a dead man by now, anyway.

573
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,694
I need a drink.

574
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,364
A real one.

575
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,702
Damien. I'm sorry.

576
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,078
Me, too.

577
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,041
And now the timeline's reset,
I should be gone.

578
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,711
Damien, I don't know what to say.

579
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:09,632
You just did.

580
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:20,268
That aroma seems familiar.

581
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:22,936
Sebastian James?

582
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:24,646
My favorite Scotch.

583
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:30,361
Did you guys always party this hard
after a successful mission?

584
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:31,988
[all laughing]

585
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,238
[chuckles]

586
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,239
I wish.

587
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,409
By the way, I...

588
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,899
I came across something
that might help you find William.

589
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,289
The symbol on the Hozen?

590
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:46,210
It matches a symbol from some
heavily redacted documents from Berlin.

591
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:51,507
Only my source couldn't find out more,
thanks to some very intense firewalls.

592
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,511
You know, I think I know a hacker
who might be able to help me.

593
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,680
You're going to see Felicity?

594
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,891
You were right, Iris.

595
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,687
I can be the person
she always wanted me to be.

596
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,108
Thank you for helping me
find myself again.

597
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,320
You made the choice to be a hero.

598
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,323
Your dad would be proud.

599
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,161
And hey, you know, don't be a stranger
while you're here in our time.

600
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:24,373
Bart and Nora, they drop in on us a lot.

601
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
And I think you guys
would get along really well.

602
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,588
Anyways, cheers.

603
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:31,755
Cheers.

604
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,059
I know that look.

605
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,355
Someone's got a crush.

606
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,317
No. No, me and Allegra are just...

607
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,358
we're just friends.

608
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,944
- Sure? Sure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

609
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,406
But you could be a lot more if you
decided to stop sipping root beer,

610
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,200
and go put a move on her.

611
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,693
I'm a lot more intuitive
than people give me credit for.

612
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,122
Come on, go for it.

613
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,459
- Okay.
- You look great.

614
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,087
Move. Moves, moves.

615
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,839
Put the moves, moves, moves.

616
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,509
- Hey, Allegra.
- Hi.

617
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,095
You look... wow...

618
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,637
[chuckles]

619
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,014
Thanks, Chuck.

620
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,599
Not bad yourself.

621
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,683
Thank you.

622
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,286
Hey, I don't know what's up
with you two...

623
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,312
- What? We're just standing here.
- What are you...

624
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,522
Like normal people.

625
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,857
- Normal.
- Both of us, man.

626
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,777
I just mean how you called me out
about Thawne earlier.

627
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,529
Oh! That.

628
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,531
I don't know what got into me.

629
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,408
No, I mean, you guys were right.

630
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,034
That's what I needed to hear.

631
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,619
So I just wanted to say thanks.

632
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,663
- Cool. Yeah.
- Yeah.

633
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,788
- Thanks. I mean, you're welcome.
- [Chester] Yeah.

634
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,540
[clears throat]

635
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,542
Have a good night.

636
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,964
- Anyway, cheers.
- Cheers.

637
00:36:58,884 --> 00:36:59,927
Damien Darhk?

638
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:02,847
You're here to arrest me?

639
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,015
I'm not a cop anymore.

640
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:08,936
I came to say thank you.

641
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,523
You helping Barry restore the timeline,

642
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,900
that's pretty damn selfless.

643
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,819
Well, what can I say?

644
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,406
Being a parent kinda...

645
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,325
changes you.

646
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,534
Mm-hmm.

647
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,535
For the better.

648
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,417
Agreed.

649
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,047
Yeah, I wish I knew why
I was still here.

650
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,217
I should be gone by now, Joe.

651
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:42,762
Nora should be in my place.

652
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,932
Well, maybe,
you've still got a little work to do.

653
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,482
Are you trying to cast a spell?

654
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,193
More like a prayer.

655
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,447
Maybe this is my unfinished business.

656
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
What is it?

657
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:08,828
It's a gift.

658
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,123
Father to father.

659
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,543
I think you're
going to need that someday.

660
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,628
What...

661
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,424
West?

662
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,344
West?

663
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,184
Huh...

664
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,521
[Nora Darhk] Dad?

665
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:40,527
Nora.

666
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,321
It's really you.

667
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,031
Where are we?

668
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,282
It doesn't matter.

669
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,870
I'm just glad I got to see you
before I go.

670
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:53,665
What do you mean?

671
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,125
I don't understand.

672
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,212
You're leaving?
I thought you were...

673
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Dead?

674
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,714
I will be.

675
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,344
I guess I just needed
a little more time.

676
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,970
Wait.

677
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,110
Dad, please.
I don't know what's happening,

678
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,268
but you can't leave now.
I just got you back.

679
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,436
I love you, Nora-doll.

680
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,693
When was the last time
we had a night out again?

681
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,486
I don't know. It's been too long.

682
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,781
Is that Nora Darhk?

683
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,367
Barry Allen?

684
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,245
Iris?

685
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,833
What am I doing here?
What just happened?

686
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,209
Where is my dad?

687
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Barry.

688
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,428
Please, someone tell me
what is going on?

689
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
[Joe] You're okay.

690
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,890
Thanks to your dad.

691
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,897
He's gone, isn't he?

692
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,612
Why is this happening again?

693
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,823
Because Damien Darhk promised

694
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,951
that he would do whatever it takes
to save his daughter.

695
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,078
And he did.

696
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:15,998
Come on.

697
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,709
There's a story I need you to hear.

698
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,062
[glass clinking]

699
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,150
Sorry, I've never done that.

700
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:50,824
So, a lot has happened
these past few days.

701
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,369
The world almost didn't make it,

702
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,495
but it did.

703
00:40:56,997 --> 00:41:00,000
Thanks to all of you
and a dedicated father.

704
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:05,631
We all survived because
when faced with the very worst,

705
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,217
it's our choices that define us.

706
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:14,139
And the choices that we made
are why we're all heroes.

707
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:20,187
So, to making our own destiny,

708
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,272
and protecting it,

709
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,232
together.

710
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:26,150
Together.

711
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,431
- [all] Cheers!
- Cheers to that.

712
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,082
Thank God.

713
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,460
Now everything can go back to normal.
