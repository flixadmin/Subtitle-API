2
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,635
My name is Barry Allen.

3
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:05,337
I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,972
When I was 11,
my mother was murdered.

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,707
I saw a ball of lightning.

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,976
Inside the lightning
there was a man.

7
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,344
He killed my mom.

8
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,013
I swear to god
I didn't do this.

9
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,714
- Where's mom?
- What happened that night

10
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,116
was impossible.

11
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,618
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,855
You were in a coma.

13
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,923
- For how long?
- Nine months.

14
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,792
Your muscles
should be atrophied,

15
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,360
But instead they're in a state
of cellular regeneration.

16
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,596
I wasn't
the only one affected, was I?

17
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:34,767
We've been searching for
other meta humans like yourself.

18
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,769
All my life
I've wanted to do more.

19
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:39,638
And the first chance I get
to help someone, I screw up.

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,007
The good you do must far
outweigh the bad.

21
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,143
You're not gonna be in here
much longer.

22
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,779
Whoever killed mom,
I think I finally have a way

23
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,113
to find them.

24
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,651
This is the part where
I'm supposed to do the whole

25
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,986
intro thingy.

26
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,754
Barry Allen,
fastest man alive...

27
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,189
But you know all that already.

28
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,791
All right,
let's get to the good stuff.

29
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,459
You see that smoke?
That's a fire

30
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,829
on Western and 3rd
in downtown Central City.

31
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,565
And that blur?
That's me on my way to it.

32
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,334
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

33
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,937
And it's a slow day.

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,338
This is ladder 52.

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,840
We're still at least
two minutes out.

36
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,175
People are gonna die in there.

37
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,744
I know.

38
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,579
Barry?

39
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,549
Barry!

40
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,817
What?
Did I miss it?

41
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,052
You overshot
by about six blocks.

42
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,089
My bad.

43
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,523
Paige!

44
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,759
My daughter!
Has anyone seen my daughter?

45
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,662
Paige!
Whoa!

46
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,897
You there yet?

47
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,900
What are you doing?

48
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,001
Nothing.

49
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,603
Who were you talking to?

50
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,838
- No one.
- Are you talking to Barry?

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,573
- Who?
- Barry Allen?

52
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,541
Struck by lighting?
Was in a coma for nine months?

53
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,077
Woke up being able to run
faster than the speed of sound?

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,345
- Ring a bell?
- No.

55
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,780
Haven't talked to him.

56
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,582
Cisco, there's fire
everywhere!

57
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,485
Cisco, are you still there?

58
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,853
Mom?

59
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,821
Mommy!

60
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,596
- Whoa!
- Mommy!

61
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,172
Everybody's out.

62
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,740
What else you got for me, Cisco?

63
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,409
Barry, it's Caitlin.

64
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,746
Hey, Caitlin.

65
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,081
How's your day?

66
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,251
Get back
to S.T.A.R. Labs. Now.

67
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,719
On my way.

68
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,757
Oh.

69
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,095
Have you both lost your minds?

70
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,897
Who do you think you are?

71
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,266
Well, I'm the eyes and ears,
and he's the feet.

72
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,567
This isn't funny.

73
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,636
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

74
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,171
You can't be
running around the city

75
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,272
like some supersonic fireman.

76
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,107
Why not?

77
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,576
This is what we talked about:
Me using my speed to do good.

78
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,745
We talked about
you helping us contain

79
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,180
other people who
might have been affected

80
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,848
by the particle accelerator
explosion.

81
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,516
Meta-humans.

82
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,319
And aside from Clyde Mardon,
we haven't found any.

83
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,288
People in this city
still need help.

84
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,822
And I can help them.

85
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,791
We can help them.

86
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,626
Will you please say something?

87
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,228
I think
what Caitlin is saying,

88
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,730
In her own
spectacularly angry way,

89
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,199
Is that we are just
beginning to understand

90
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,967
what your body is capable of.

91
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,536
Not to sound like a broken
record, Mr. Allen...

92
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,538
I do caution restraint.

93
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,307
Dr. Wells...

94
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,877
I doubt restraint is how you got
to be the man you are today.

95
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,012
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

96
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:38,884
Lack of restraint
is what made me these things.

97
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,688
Know your limits.

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,289
Don't expect me to
patch you up

99
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,159
every time you break something.

100
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,027
Hey, uh...
Anything happen out there today?

101
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,796
The sensors in the suit
were kicking back

102
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:54,299
some weird telemetry, like your
vitals spiked for a few seconds.

103
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,834
Never felt better.

104
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,407
Hey, Joe,
everything all right?

105
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,776
Great.
I got a fresh crime scene...

106
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,044
A dead body...

107
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,713
Detectives interviewing
witnesses...

108
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,915
Miles of that yellow tape
stretched over everything.

109
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,251
I'm only missing one thing.
Can you guess what that is?

110
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,753
I'll be right there.

111
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,356
My day job beckons.

112
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,760
When do you think
he'll realize

113
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,795
he didn't take his clothes?

114
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,870
Hmm.

115
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,308
Perp made off with
a bunch of handguns,

116
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,909
at least six glock 19s

117
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,746
fitted with extra
ammunition magazines.

118
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,282
Somebody's looking to do
a whole lot of bad.

119
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,017
Hey, sorry I'm late.

120
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,953
Doing a little fall shopping,
Mr. Allen?

121
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,755
Oh.

122
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,623
I was going so fast this
morning, I didn't even notice.

123
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,625
Oh.

124
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,595
Yeah.

125
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,598
I downloaded the surveillance
footage off the video camera.

126
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,503
Looks like only one perp.

127
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,649
Footage may only show one,
but it was six guys.

128
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,451
Look, the tracks.
They're all crossing each other.

129
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,853
Six sets of footprints.
Six guns stolen.

130
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,489
We should be looking for a crew.

131
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,925
Huh...
Weird.

132
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,861
The shoes, it looks like
they're all the same size.

133
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,830
Men's tens, I'd guess.

134
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,165
Just like you, Captain.

135
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,168
Not that you're a suspect, sir.
I...

136
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,440
Your ability to multi-task
is truly remarkable.

137
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,376
The way you can embarrass me,
the Captain, and yourself

138
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,478
- ...all at the same time.
- Joe, I'm sorry.

139
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,113
I'm starting to think
"Joe, I'm sorry" is

140
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,982
my actual name considering how
often you say it to me.

141
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,118
I'm dealing with a lot
right now.

142
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,586
Look, I know you are.

143
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,121
Believe me,
I'm dealing with it, too.

144
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,790
I've always had
a very simple set of beliefs.

145
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,293
Gravity makes things fall.
Water makes things wet.

146
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,161
And up until a few weeks ago,
I believed

147
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,996
the fastest man could
run a mile in four minutes.

148
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,665
Not four seconds.

149
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,766
I could do it in three.

150
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,701
Not relevant.

151
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,170
You haven't said anything to
Iris about all this, have you?

152
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,206
No, I made you a promise.
I keep my promises.

153
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,741
Keep on lying like that.

154
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,709
You're liable to get struck by
lightning again.

155
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,211
Get up to the lab.
Start processing the evidence

156
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,213
from the gun store.

157
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,597
Hey, Iris.

158
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,432
Did Barry run away again?

159
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,267
Unless that's one of your
homework questions, little lady,

160
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,335
It's none of your business.

161
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,604
Go on back to your room.

162
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,838
I want to see my dad.

163
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,607
I already said no, Barry.

164
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,942
He didn't do those things.
He didn't hurt my mom.

165
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,711
I was there that night.
I saw.

166
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,379
- There was a man.
- Yeah, I know.

167
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,215
We've gone through this already.

168
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:01,019
Then why can't I go see him?

169
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,088
Because I said so.

170
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,624
You're not my father!
You can't tell me what to do!

171
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,893
Right now, I am the only adult
that gives a damn

172
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,129
what happens to you, so yes,
I can tell you what to do.

173
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,297
Now go to your room.

174
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,800
I hate you!

175
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,642
This is all of your fault.

176
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,110
I could have taken
European folklore

177
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,079
to cover my sociology
requirement, but no.

178
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,014
You said,
"take journalism, Iris.

179
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,549
Reporters have all of the fun."

180
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,618
Guess what, Barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,653
Journalism is boring.
I'm bored.

182
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,323
I blame you.
What?

183
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,525
Why are you staring at me
like that?

184
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,161
You look really nice.

185
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,562
Thanks.

186
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,965
Why don't you look nice?

187
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,867
This afternoon?
Suit and tie?

188
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,368
The university
is giving Simon Stagg...

189
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,237
- Simon Stagg.
- Some big award.

190
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,005
And you agreed...
to explain the science stuff

191
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,307
for your article.
It's all coming back to me now.

192
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,676
How fast can you
get home and change?

193
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,545
Uh, pretty fast.

194
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,980
Hey, Allen.

195
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,348
Joe asked me to see
where you're at

196
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,183
on the evidence
from the gun store shooting.

197
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,317
Oh, hey, Iris.

198
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,819
Detective.

199
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,623
Please, guys, uh,
just kiss already.

200
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,192
I already know, remember?

201
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,466
Ah. Thanks for being so cool
about this, Barry.

202
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,569
I know it's not easy
keeping a big secret.

203
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,538
I'm getting used to it.

204
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,745
I find it quite remarkable,

205
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,947
having once been
a timid freshman

206
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,181
at Central City university,

207
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,183
to be standing before you now,

208
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,952
the regents choice
for man of the year.

209
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,788
While I very much
appreciate the award,

210
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,056
the real honor for me is
knowing that

211
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,525
my work in organ transference

212
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,894
helps give people
a second chance at life.

213
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,463
Thank you all very much
for coming.

214
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,434
Okay.
All right, first things first...

215
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,902
Simon Stagg's work
in cellular cloning

216
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,437
has led to huge advancements

217
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,072
in the future of organ
replacement...

218
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,607
Are journalists allowed
to drink on the job?

219
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,108
Okay.
If you are bored already,

220
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,410
just wait till we get to
the science behind

221
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,645
cellular regeneration.

222
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,447
I have missed this, Barry.

223
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,249
I feel like we haven't spent
any quality time together

224
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,951
since you woke up from the coma.

225
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,353
Yeah, I've had a crazy
few weeks, I know.

226
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,590
I thought maybe you'd been
avoiding me because of Eddie.

227
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,925
I know you think it's wrong,
me dating my dad's partner,

228
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,926
- And I just...
- No.

229
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,530
That is not it.
At all.

230
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,432
Oh!
Oh!

231
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,933
Mr. Stagg, I was wondering if
I could get a quote from you

232
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,602
- ...for my article.
- Not now, Miss.

233
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,072
I'll just make something up.

234
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,940
So...
What were you gonna tell me?

235
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,576
You looked like
you were about to say something.

236
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,311
Yeah...

237
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,248
ah!

238
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,517
Quiet down!
All of you!

239
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,518
Oh, my god.

240
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,887
Quiet!

241
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,556
How considerate!

242
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,359
You're all wearing
your finest jewelry!

243
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,396
Almost like you knew
we were coming to rob you!

244
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,398
Now everybody line up!

245
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,072
Don't.
Don't.

246
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,575
Freeze!

247
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,480
D-d-drop your weapons!

248
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,875
Barry.

249
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,510
Barry.

250
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,711
Barry!

251
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,279
I turned around
and you were gone.

252
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,282
What happened?
Are you okay?

253
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,451
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I...

254
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,620
I went after them to
try and get the plates.

255
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,488
- Wha...?
- And I...

256
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,290
I fainted.

257
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,965
- Hi.
- Iris.

258
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,033
Where were you?

259
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,334
Dad, go easy.

260
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,470
I found him outside.
He fainted.

261
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,971
You want me to get you
a paramedic, Allen?

262
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,107
No, I'm fine.
Thanks, Eddie.

263
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,375
I thought I was dead.

264
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,644
I saw the gun go off, and then...
boom.

265
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,412
Suddenly I'm outside.

266
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,581
I have no idea how I got there.

267
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,650
Let me talk to you
for a second.

268
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,853
Yeah.

269
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,688
You chased those gunmen,
didn't you?

270
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,190
Yeah, they must be
the same guys

271
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,825
that knocked over the gun shop
earlier today.

272
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,861
And what were you going to do
when you caught them?

273
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,196
Huh?

274
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,731
Ask them nicely to pull over?

275
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,566
You're not bulletproof.

276
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,267
Wait.
Are you?

277
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,369
- No, but...
- Okay.

278
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,671
No more heroics.

279
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,206
Chasing bad guys
is not your job.

280
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,608
It's mine.
You're not a cop.

281
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,243
Promise me.

282
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,778
Promise.

283
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,680
And you know
Iris is not stupid.

284
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,983
Start making better excuses
than "I fainted."

285
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,084
I...

286
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,886
You lied to us.

287
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,155
How could you not tell us you're
experiencing dizzy spells?

288
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,923
We're your doctors.

289
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,825
God knows what's going on
inside your body.

290
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,827
Your cells are in
a constant state of flux.

291
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,530
You could be experiencing
cardiopulmonary failure

292
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,733
or a transient ischemic attack.

293
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,935
Mini stroke.
Probably not.

294
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,706
You of all people should know
that in science, we share.

295
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,941
We do not keep secrets.

296
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,512
Wow...
I haven't seen anyone

297
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,948
make her that angry
since Ronnie.

298
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,750
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiance?

299
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,253
The one that died the night of
the accelerator explosion?

300
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,755
Yeah.
He is...

301
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,757
Missed.

302
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,392
Now...

303
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,095
Let's figure out why
this is happening to you.

304
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,764
We're all set.

305
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,333
A little padding.
Just in case.

306
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,601
Yeah.

307
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,775
You're sure about this, Cisco?

308
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,311
Most home treadmills have a
maximum speed of about

309
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,746
12 miles per hour.

310
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,915
This one has been cisco'ed.

311
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,717
Trust me.
It can handle your speed.

312
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,619
Okay.

313
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,231
Heart rate, blood pressure,
nerve conduction all normal.

314
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,632
For Barry.

315
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,100
Brainwave function
within standard limits.

316
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,168
I told you

317
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,770
the treadmill could take it.

318
00:13:58,772 --> 00:13:59,971
Caitlin.

319
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,207
Look at the glucose levels.

320
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,708
Oh, my god.
Of course.

321
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,809
- Right?
- It was so obvious.

322
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,844
Glucose levels.
Barry!

323
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,579
We think we know why you keep...

324
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,316
Passing out.

325
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,956
Barry!

326
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,878
Where's Barry?

327
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
Taking a shower.

328
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,816
At three o'clock
in the afternoon?

329
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,051
If I go up those stairs,
am I gonna see Barry Allen?

330
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,954
Or are you gonna be grounded
for a week for lying to me?

331
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,322
I'm sorry, daddy.

332
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,325
But don't worry.
I know where he went.

333
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,794
Me too.

334
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,806
I passed out again?

335
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,141
Total metabolic failure

336
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,410
brought on by
acute hypoglycemia.

337
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,745
I'm not eating enough.

338
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,067
So an IV bag
and I'm good to go?

339
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,850
Try 40.

340
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,418
Guess you were thirsty.

341
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,686
We're gonna need to
fashion you a new diet

342
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,354
based on your metabolic changes.

343
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,623
I've done a few calculations.
You need to consume

344
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,127
an amount equal to roughly
850 tacos.

345
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,729
Unless we're talking
cheese and guac,

346
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,865
Which is like a whole other
set of equations.

347
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,867
For Mexican,
I recommend Tito's.

348
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,102
On Bruckner avenue?

349
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,270
Best burrito in the city.

350
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,738
Detective West.

351
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,409
What brings you
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

352
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,311
When I couldn't find you
at your lab,

353
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,713
I started doing
a little research.

354
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:53,184
Turns out there's been reports
of a red streak around the city,

355
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,254
Stopping muggers, rescuing
people from burning buildings.

356
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:00,959
You didn't tell him
we were working together?

357
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,593
Joe, I can explain.

358
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,364
You already have a job
in law enforcement, Barry.

359
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,099
I suggest you get back to it.

360
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,301
Mm-hmm.

361
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,136
Don't look at me.
I'm on your side.

362
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,538
Detective.

363
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,806
We all want
what's best for Barry.

364
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,874
If you wanted what was
best for Barry,

365
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,643
You'd try to
talk him out of this lunacy

366
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,412
instead of encouraging him going
out there risking his life.

367
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:25,083
You saw a man
control the weather.

368
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:29,153
What are the police gonna do
against someone like that?

369
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,788
Since the accelerator explosion

370
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,825
we suspect
there may be more like him.

371
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,159
And you're gonna do what?

372
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,794
Catch them?

373
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,363
Are you insane?

374
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,798
You think because
you can run real fast

375
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,134
that you're invincible?
You're not!

376
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,802
You're just a kid.

377
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,172
My kid.

378
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,043
I'm not your kid, Joe.

379
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,612
And you're not my father.

380
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,950
My father's sitting
in Iron Heights.

381
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,819
Wrongfully convicted.

382
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,521
You were wrong about him.

383
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,690
And you're wrong about this.

384
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,525
Now I may not be able
to help him,

385
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,328
But if I can save someone
from a burning building

386
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,431
or stop some armed thieves,
I'm gonna do it.

387
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,434
And you can't stop me.

388
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,869
So don't try.

389
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,712
You think you're so smart.

390
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,048
All of you.

391
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,651
But you don't know
what you don't know.

392
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,187
And I hope that you're clever
enough to figure it out

393
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,189
before somebody gets killed.

394
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,677
Where's the rest of your crew?

395
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,678
Just me.

396
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
What do you want, Black?

397
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,948
The only thing
I still want in life...

398
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,750
Your boss dead.

399
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,585
It's not my fault you and
your team moved too slow.

400
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,921
I told you where Stagg would be,
not how long he'd be there.

401
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,489
I need his full itinerary.

402
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,825
And security access to
his office and home.

403
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,493
Screw you.

404
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,462
I've got a reputation
in the security business.

405
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,330
It's one thing if
my employer gets iced.

406
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,933
It's another if it happens
in his bedroom.

407
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,436
You'll do what I ask,
Mr. Java.

408
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,443
What the hell are you gonna
do to me without your army?

409
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,603
I am an army.

410
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,354
Come to yell at me again?

411
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,557
Simon Stagg's head of security
was murdered last night.

412
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,526
The coroner took
some skin samples.

413
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,994
Hopefully they belong
to the killer.

414
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,629
See if you can find a match.

415
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,830
Can't be a coincidence that
Stagg's benefit

416
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,198
was attacked last night.

417
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
I'm going to
interview Stagg now.

418
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,134
- I'll come with you.
- Your job is in here.

419
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,803
Stay in here and do it.

420
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,639
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, baby.

421
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,474
Gotta go.

422
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,709
Why is my dad mad at you?

423
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,480
Work stuff.

424
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,117
Why are<i> you</i> mad at me?

425
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,785
You were supposed to
meet me at jitters

426
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,154
to give me some scientific
background for my article.

427
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,889
And I didn't show up.

428
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,058
And now I have to come up with
a new article topic in 24 hours

429
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,793
or I fail the assignment.

430
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,962
- Iris...
- Don't say that you're sorry.

431
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,630
Okay, I know that you are.

432
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,032
What I don't know is
what is going on with you.

433
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,634
We grew up one bedroom down

434
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,969
from each other.
Do you honestly think that

435
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,971
I don't know when you're happy?

436
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,407
Or sad or depressed or lost?

437
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,209
I'm gonna ask you
one last time, Barry Allen,

438
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,977
and you better
be honest with me.

439
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,645
What the...

440
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,214
You want to know
what's happening.

441
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,848
I'm fast now.

442
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,051
God, I just want to tell you.

443
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,686
How I feel.

444
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,688
How you make me feel.

445
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,690
But I can't.

446
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,225
Hell is going on with you?

447
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,663
We are not done
talking about this.

448
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,698
That's impossible.

449
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,132
There was a murder last night.

450
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,701
These skin cells belong to
the murderer,

451
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,069
But these cells are naive.

452
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,670
Stem cells that
they can replicate

453
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,706
and become any cell
the body needs.

454
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,507
They only come from babies.

455
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,611
This means
your killer is what, a newborn?

456
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,146
You honestly think that
someone wants to kill me?

457
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,948
Well, we're not sure,
Mr. Stagg, but...

458
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,150
An event you were being honored
at was robbed at gunpoint.

459
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,853
And your head of security
was found murdered this morning.

460
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,055
I am a scientist
and a philanthropist.

461
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,224
We're not often
the targets of assassins.

462
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,792
Well... What about lawsuits?

463
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,562
You got about 20 of those
pending against you.

464
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,897
It is a sad fact of life,
Detective, that

465
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,432
when you earn a lot of money,

466
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,302
people who haven't think
they can take yours.

467
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,437
People like this guy,
for example?

468
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,573
Danton Black?

469
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,907
Danton Black.

470
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,944
You fired him.
Now he's suing you.

471
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,847
Unfortunately, our working
relationship wasn't successful,

472
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,283
But I can assure you both
of one thing.

473
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,118
Danton Black...

474
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,020
is not a killer.

475
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,789
He's a clinical researcher,
not a criminal mastermind.

476
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,925
Now, if I can help you
in any way, please let me know.

477
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,927
I want these people caught
as much as you.

478
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,296
Then here we are!

479
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,297
Down!

480
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,251
Captain, what's going on?

481
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,619
Not now, Barry.
An armed gunman

482
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,822
is shooting up
Stagg industries.

483
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,791
Joe's there.

484
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,934
Get him out of here.
I'll cover you.

485
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,470
Ready?
Go.

486
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,798
Go!

487
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
No.

488
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,804
Whoever you are,
give yourself up.

489
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,805
Sorry.

490
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,273
We are not going anywhere.

491
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,677
All: Until Simon Stagg is dead.

492
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,825
Sorry.

493
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,693
The abrasions are already
rapidly healing.

494
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,729
Yeah, I got my ass
handed to me.

495
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,764
You got blood on my suit.

496
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,534
I think some of it
belongs to him.

497
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,036
Another not-so-friendly
meta-human.

498
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,307
Danton Black.

499
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,575
He's a bio-geneticist

500
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,544
specialized in
therapeutic cloning.

501
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,379
Growing new organs
to replace failing ones.

502
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:11,549
Apparently Stagg stole his
research and then fired him.

503
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,652
I saw black create duplicates
from his own body.

504
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,820
That's pretty ironic.

505
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,254
The guy specialized in cloning

506
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,756
and now he can make
xeroxes of himself.

507
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,592
If he was
experimenting on himself

508
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,993
when he was exposed to
the dark matter wave

509
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,229
released by the particle
accelerator explosion...

510
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:29,166
Meet Captain Clone.

511
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,601
Don't worry.

512
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,770
I'll come up with
something cooler.

513
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,709
Where are you going?

514
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,778
Joe was right.

515
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,279
I'm in way over my head.

516
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,449
Yeah, I'm fast,
but I am no warrior.

517
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:49,220
Man, I could barely fight one
meta-human, let alone six.

518
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,790
Barry.

519
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,325
I understand.

520
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,893
Today was a setback.

521
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,728
But any grand enterprise
has them.

522
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,466
And we can never learn to fly
without crashing a few times.

523
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:06,637
This wasn't
a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

524
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,639
This was a mistake.

525
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,791
Dad!

526
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:31,629
Sorry.
No physical contact.

527
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,796
Five minutes, Allen.

528
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,302
Sit down, son.

529
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,173
Barry, how did you get here?

530
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,309
I ran here.
Joe wouldn't bring me.

531
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,477
He wouldn't let me see you.

532
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,045
- I hate him.
- No, no.

533
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,781
Don't... don't say that.

534
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,518
It isn't Joe that
doesn't want you to come here.

535
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,721
I don't want you to come here.

536
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,858
I don't want you to
see me like this.

537
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,059
You have to let him go.

538
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,961
My dad didn't do these things.

539
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,362
He didn't hurt my mom.

540
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,864
It was the man
in the lightning.

541
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,132
The lightning man
killed my mom.

542
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,199
- Barry, look at me.
- Not my dad.

543
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,536
Look at me.

544
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,040
You can't help me.

545
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,109
Okay?
Now Joe's gonna look after you

546
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,911
until I can get out of here.

547
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:26,250
You just be the good boy that
your mom and I know you are.

548
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,934
Dad?

549
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,103
Dad?

550
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,951
Detective, was
the gunman apprehended?

551
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,454
The shooter's whereabouts are
unknown at this time.

552
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,423
We consider him armed and
extremely dangerous.

553
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,827
Thank you.
No more questions.

554
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,261
Nice work, Eddie.

555
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,297
Nah.
Right place, right time.

556
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,032
No, you were a hero today.

557
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,701
CCPD still has
a killer on the loose.

558
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,103
I should get
back to the precinct.

559
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,671
Okay.

560
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,144
So did you come here
for caffeine,

561
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,913
Or are you finally gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

562
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,587
Mr. Stagg, I wish you would

563
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,189
reconsider our offer for
protective custody.

564
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,025
Danton Black has proven
he is willing to kill,

565
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,594
And he's got uh...
Friends.

566
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,963
And trust me,
they're all dangerous.

567
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,632
I've increased
my security, Detective.

568
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,168
I hope Black comes
looking for trouble.

569
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,170
'Cause he'll find plenty.

570
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,575
Spoken like
a true philanthropist.

571
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,844
Or is it humanitarian?
Ah.

572
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,546
I'm sorry.
I can never remember

573
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,816
which one you're
pretending to be, Simon.

574
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:06,984
Harrison...

575
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:08,052
Don't get up.

576
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,553
Ha-ha!

577
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,726
Another fan of yours, doctor?

578
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,661
Can we talk, Detective?

579
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,530
So you were right.

580
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,665
Barry's not the only one
who's special.

581
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,269
This guy that tried to kill
Simon Stagg today, he could...

582
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,538
replicate spontaneously.

583
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,707
Yeah, we know.

584
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,844
Did you know about Barry?

585
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,980
When he was first in his coma

586
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,249
you came to the hospital,
and you asked me

587
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:42,252
if you could take
him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

588
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,822
Did you know what he could do?

589
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,397
I had my suspicions
that he was...

590
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,598
Affected.

591
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,599
Mm-hmm.

592
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,234
Hey, Joe...

593
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,769
I was never looking to become
the senior member

594
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,871
of a secret crime fighting unit.

595
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,539
You and I both know

596
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,809
we are the only ones equipped
to protect Central City.

597
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,645
Maybe I'm more interested in
protecting Barry.

598
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,047
But of course
he's all set to fly

599
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,315
into the fire
right along with you.

600
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,750
No, he's not.

601
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:15,085
Not anymore.
He quit.

602
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,255
He didn't tell you?

603
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,723
I haven't seen him.

604
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,125
Well I'm sure
it's only temporary.

605
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,426
From what I know of Barry,

606
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,228
When he sets his mind
to something...

607
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,562
No one's gonna
talk him out of it.

608
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,465
But the next time he suits up...

609
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,833
Fshh!

610
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,668
Runs headlong into danger...

611
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,437
He will fail.

612
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,873
Why?

613
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,708
He doesn't think he's capable.

614
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,444
Doubt...

615
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,479
Is his real enemy.

616
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,982
Joe, not whatever's
lurking out there.

617
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,451
And as long as
you continue to doubt him,

618
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,653
He'll keep doubting himself.

619
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,960
And for the record...

620
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,962
I care about him, too.

621
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,575
Guess you were hungry.

622
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,878
- Stress eating.
- Ah.

623
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,580
I came to say I'm sorry.

624
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,816
And you're right.
I have been distant.

625
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,319
- Correct.
- Kind of a jerk.

626
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,787
You should apologize
more often.

627
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,389
You are really
sensational at it.

628
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,456
Hmm.

629
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,826
Hmm.
So...

630
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,127
What were you going to tell me
the other day?

631
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,562
I thought
I had to do something.

632
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,330
Something I thought
was important,

633
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,334
But it turns out that
I'm not very good at it.

634
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,770
But what I am good at
is being your friend.

635
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,271
So if you need help
coming up with

636
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,207
- ...a new topic for your article...
- I found one.

637
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,809
Something that
actually interests me.

638
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,078
I know this is
gonna sound crazy...

639
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,747
It's been all over
the internet this week.

640
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,782
At a building fire...

641
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,150
At a bank heist...

642
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,551
Even the other night
when those robbers

643
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,619
shot at the security guard,

644
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,955
he said he was whooshed outside.

645
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,791
Something out there
is saving people.

646
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:01,959
I thought you were taking
journalism.

647
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,727
Not science fiction writing.

648
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,995
Ever since I have known you

649
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,163
you have believed in
the impossible.

650
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,131
What if you were right?

651
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,414
What if you were right about
the night that your mom died?

652
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,571
Look, I told you I'm through.

653
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,807
I know, but you need
to get to S.T.A.R. Labs

654
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,876
right now.

655
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,553
- Barry, it's okay.
- It is not okay.

656
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,522
Black is here,
and he's just... Standing there.

657
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,358
That's not him, is it?

658
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,226
It's one of his replicates.

659
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,628
How did you get it?

660
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,197
I grew him.

661
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,833
I isolated a sample of
Black's blood from you suit

662
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,235
to see if I could trigger the
in vitro cultivation process

663
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,237
and learn how Black multiplies.

664
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,007
So I exposed the target cells to
a protein gel,

665
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,808
And they began replicating...

666
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,876
Into that.

667
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:53,877
Why isn't he...

668
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,979
It doing anything?

669
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,547
We did a brain scan.

670
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,950
Involuntary motor functions
are active, little else.

671
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,485
We think it's acting
as a receiver.

672
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,421
The clones are an empty shell
without Black.

673
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,756
Shut down the real Black,

674
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,858
And you might
shut them all down.

675
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,726
But how do we know which one's
the real Danton Black?

676
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,862
That occurred to me
given your own passing out.

677
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,530
Black has limits,
just like you.

678
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,232
Controlling all of those clones

679
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,568
nust require a tremendous
amount of physical strength.

680
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,005
So, look for the one showing
signs of weakness or fatigue.

681
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,006
He's the prime.

682
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,574
Just a theory...

683
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,543
But one you might want to put to
the test, Mr. Allen.

684
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,912
Plus, I whipped up these high-
calorie protein bars

685
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,581
for you to keep
your metabolism up.

686
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,749
Ah!

687
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,918
Ah!

688
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,621
Any more of them?

689
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,622
Nope.

690
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,257
Why did it start moving?

691
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,858
The prime.

692
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,193
My guess is,
the prime is on the move.

693
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,561
This one heard
the summons to battle.

694
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,296
And I know where
he was summoned to.

695
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,065
Stagg industries.

696
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,866
You should call it in.

697
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,736
Police can't fight this.

698
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:56,506
What Black's become,
like Mardon...

699
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,774
Beyond me.

700
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,943
Maybe way beyond them, too.

701
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,012
The only person it's not beyond

702
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,680
is you.

703
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,616
You gotta do this.
I get it.

704
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:10,654
So for once in your life,
do what I tell you to do.

705
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,656
Go stop him.

706
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,873
Just get me those figures
by morning, okay?

707
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,513
Freeze.
Don't move.

708
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,867
Hello, Danton.

709
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,702
Goodbye, Simon.

710
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,707
Stay here.

711
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,247
I know Stagg stole
your research,

712
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,849
But that doesn't give you
the right to murder.

713
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,533
You think this is about
my job.

714
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,401
Aah!

715
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,003
This is about Elizabeth.

716
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,005
She was my wife.

717
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,840
Gah!

718
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,342
She had a
degenerative coronary disease.

719
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,145
She'd been on the transplant
list for years, but...

720
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,414
Time was running out.

721
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,416
So if I couldn't get her
a new heart...

722
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,152
You were gonna grow her one.

723
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,821
I was so close.

724
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,989
Until Stagg stole my research.

725
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,226
So he could reap the glory.

726
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,996
And I got to bury
my best friend.

727
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,666
Now...

728
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,767
I'm alone.

729
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,103
Gah!

730
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,713
Ah!

731
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:24,721
Ah!

732
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,059
Remember, Barry.
Find the prime.

733
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,660
There's too many of them
to fight.

734
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,263
Barry,
you need to isolate the prime.

735
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,966
I can't.
It's impossible.

736
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,768
Nothing's impossible, Barry.
You taught me that.

737
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,003
You can do this.

738
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,813
Barry.

739
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,182
Barry, are you all right?

740
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,817
I'm fine.

741
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,686
I'm fine.

742
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,322
It's done.

743
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,164
Hang on!

744
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,067
No!

745
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,672
Don't.

746
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,273
Ah!

747
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,454
Central city police officials
are now confirming

748
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,056
former employee Danton Black...
tried to save him.

749
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,959
Doesn't sound like
he wanted to be saved.

750
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,462
Some people, when they break...

751
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,465
They can't be
put together again.

752
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:19,269
Some people heal
even stronger.

753
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,271
I hope so.

754
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,379
Well, at least multiplex

755
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,015
won't be able
to hurt anyone else.

756
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,617
Told you
I'd come up with a cool name.

757
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,457
Yeah, I may be the one in the
suit doing all the running...

758
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,960
But when I'm out there helping
people, making a difference...

759
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,463
You're all out there with me.

760
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,235
Finally realized something,

761
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,772
We were all struck
by that lightning.

762
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,358
Hungry?

763
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,664
Pepperoni, olives...

764
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,765
And jalapeños.

765
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,667
Just like you like it.

766
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:28,071
Thank you.

767
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,407
You were wrong.

768
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,108
I have been wrong
a lot this week.

769
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,843
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

770
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,979
You said that
one of things driving you

771
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,982
to run around out there was that
you couldn't help your dad.

772
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,656
You can help him.

773
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,525
We can.

774
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,026
We're gonna figure out

775
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,862
who or what killed
your mother that night.

776
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,800
And then we're gonna get
your father out of prison.

777
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,802
Together.

778
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,376
Joe, what I said about
you not being my father...

779
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:07,844
Barry, I know.

780
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,581
I know I'm not your father.

781
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,983
You're right.
You're not.

782
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,354
You're just...
The man who kept me fed

783
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,889
and in clothes...

784
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,758
Who sat beside my bed at night
until I fell asleep,

785
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,828
because I was
afraid of the dark...

786
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,263
helped me with my homework...

787
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,867
You taught me how to drive
and shave...

788
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,205
And you dropped me off
at college.

789
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,807
Sounds a lot like a dad to me.

790
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,326
Every kid dreams of
being a superhero.

791
00:39:56,328 --> 00:39:58,528
Having powers.
Saving people.

792
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,764
But no kid thinks about what
it's like when you're a hero

793
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,732
and you're not saving people.

794
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,000
Truth is...

795
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,235
not much else changes.

796
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,470
You still hurt.
You still love.

797
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,006
You still wish and hope
and fear things.

798
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,243
And you still need people
to help you with all of it.

799
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,646
In some ways,
that's the best part.

800
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,917
Barry, an armored car was just
hijacked on griffin avenue.

801
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,051
Get your ass over there.

802
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,420
I got it.
Actually...

803
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,654
The best part?

804
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,156
It's this.

805
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,171
Wells...

806
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:43,373
Who the hell let you in here?

807
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,141
You been having
a party out there?

808
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,243
I'm sure you saw on TV.

809
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:50,213
A former employee of mine
tried to kill me.

810
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:54,017
Former employee with
the ability to replicate...

811
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:57,720
Faced off against a man
who could move at super speed.

812
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:01,658
You've seen him too,
haven't you?

813
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,959
Indeed, I have.

814
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,895
Extraordinary.

815
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,131
The power he possesses,
it's like the...

816
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,299
It's like the gods of old.

817
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,634
It's like mercury on earth.

818
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,870
Can you imagine if you could
control his power?

819
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,305
If you could... if you could
harness it?

820
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:19,375
You could change what it means
to be human.

821
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,544
The man in a red mask
is the key,

822
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:24,714
And I'm gonna get him.

823
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,954
The man in the red mask.

824
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:33,656
He's called the Flash.

825
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,825
Or at least...

826
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,261
He will be one day.

827
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,931
What the hell?

828
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,737
Forgive me, Simon.

829
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,239
I worry you think that
you will think this is personal,

830
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,773
And it's not.

831
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,243
It's just that
the man in the red mask...

832
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:56,279
The fastest man alive...

833
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,381
He must be kept...

834
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,986
Safe.
