1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,257
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:07,050
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,452
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:12,321
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:16,942
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:22,114
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:25,301
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,355
Previously on "Arrow"...
I'm Barry Allen,

9
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:31,123
from the Central City
police department.

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,958
I'm with the crime scene
investigation unit.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,227
I have friends
that can help.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,980
This miracle could kill you.
Do it.

13
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,685
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

14
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,604
You think someone
found the recipe?

15
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,406
A centrifuge
and a large supply of blood.

16
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,808
I think someone wants
to make more of it.

17
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:53,029
- Oliver!
- Is he alive?

18
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,914
Felicity, we can't save him!
I know. We can't.

19
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,899
Ow!

20
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:59,335
Please save my friend.

21
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,655
Hold him!

22
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,373
He's not going
to make it.

23
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,592
He will. We just have
to find out what's in his system.

24
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,788
I--I--I usually only
work on dead people.

25
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,529
Barry!

26
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:11,632
All right, I can
think of four possible diagnosis

27
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:14,517
for what's causing his body
to react this way.

28
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:20,273
Make that three
possible diagnosis.

29
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:22,308
Two.

30
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,761
Start chest
compressions.

31
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,352
Got it.

32
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,571
He's suffering from
intravenous coagulation.

33
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:38,524
His blood is unnaturally clotting.
It's like maple syrup.

34
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:40,042
You can save him, right?

35
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,750
Lucky you guys
have a rat problem.

36
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,669
Are you kidding?
That'll kill him!

37
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,137
He dies if I don't.

38
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:54,056
Felicity...
Do it!

39
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,812
Just the right amount of this stuff
will thin his blood enough

40
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:01,898
to get it
circulating again.

41
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:10,540
Let go, Oliver.

42
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,359
He's crashing.

43
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:16,946
Don't fight anymore.

44
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:18,498
Oliver, stay with me!

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,232
Stay with me.

46
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,781

Oliver, let him go.
Oliver!

49
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,590
What the...

50
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:46,192
What the hell
is going on?

51
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,093
You were injected with
a strong-acting blood coagulant.

52
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:51,814
You would have
stroked out, ahem,

53
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:54,867
but fortunately you had
a very effective blood thinner handy.

54
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:56,302
Warfarin.

55
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:57,820
Better known as rat poison.

56
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,405
Kid saved your life,
Oliver.

57
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,541
This is the point
in a lifesaving emergency

58
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:03,743
where you thank
the person that did the lifesaving.

59
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:06,379
You told him who I am.
Yeah, I did.

60
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:09,916
That's not your secret
to tell, Felicity.

61
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:14,003
I decide who finds out
my identity.

62
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,455
Well, we didn't
have time to get your vote,

63
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,591
what with you
unconscious and dying.

64
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:20,259
What happens if he leaves here
and goes right to the police?

65
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,294
He wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.

66
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,679
I trust him.
I don't!

67
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,064
What are you going to do,
put an arrow in him?

68
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,399
I am considering it.
Don't worry,

69
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,935
he's kidding! How is
this any different

70
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:30,736
from when your mother shot you
and you came to me for help?

71
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,438
Your mother shot you?
Or when you brought Dig

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
down here when he was
poisoned with curare.

73
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:38,143
The difference is that
I did my homework on both of you!

74
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:41,146
I don't just
tell people easily.

75
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,865
I'm not going
to tell anyone.

76
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,201
And you don't have to thank me,
but you should thank her

77
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,336
instead of being
kind of a jerk.

78
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,907
Mr. Queen.

79
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,384
I have to go home.

80
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,219
That man that I fought
in the bunker,

81
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:05,353
he has what he needs
to mass produce

82
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,140
the serum from the island.

83
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:10,443
And we have to stop him.

84
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:18,117
He touched your skin
when he grabbed your neck.

85
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,519
I was able to absorb
the residual oils from his skin,

86
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,822
which, when added
to a gel-based polymer,

87
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,357
might be able
to recreate his fingerprint.

88
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:34,567
Never meet
your heroes, right?

89
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:39,922
Mom?

90
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:42,842
Oliver, thank you
for coming home, sweetheart.

91
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:45,277
Is everything all right?

92
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,886
Well, I don't know.

93
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,314
Your sister has locked
herself in her room

94
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:49,148
and she won't
talk to me.

95
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,851
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.
Ok.

96
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,322
It's Christmas.

97
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,858
Yes.

98
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,994
But given the last
gala that we threw,

99
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,897
I think we're going to skip
this year's Christmas party.

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,559
Thea, it's Ollie.
Open the door.

101
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,243
Not--not now, Ollie.

102
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,179
Speedy,
open the door!

103
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:23,049
Is mom with you?
No!

104
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,536
What's going on?

105
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,272
I didn't want mom to see.
See what?

106
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,147
What happened to him?

107
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,533
Vigilante decided to use him
as target practice.

108
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,601
You're right--

109
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,538
the guy's a psycho.

110
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,040
Why didn't you go
to the hospital?

111
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,966
In this city, an arrow's
the same as a bullet

112
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:50,823
if you want the cops involved.

113
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,713
And mom actually
likes Roy,

114
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,998
but something tells me she'd revoke
his tree trimming invitation

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,634
if she found out he was
messing around with the Hood.

116
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:01,420
Uh-huh.

117
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:04,557
Hi.

118
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,942
Roy.

119
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,711
This is going
to hurt.

120
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,796
My anger's dulling the pain.

121
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,631
This will
dull it better.

122
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,613
Going to put
pressure on it.

123
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:29,832
Right there.

124
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:39,759
Diggle, I need you to come
to the Queen mansion.

125
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:43,262
Roy's been shot.

126
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,198
With an arrow.

127
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,933
It's a long story.

128
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:51,270
Look, just bring the first aid kit
to Thea's room.

129
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,140
Thank you.

130
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,838
Roy, my driver, Mr. Diggle,

131
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,228
he has medical training
from his time in the army.

132
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,813
He's going to patch you up.
Thank you.

133
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:02,348
It's the least I can do.

134
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,316
Look, I don't know what
the three of you are up to,

135
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,503
but maybe the vigilante
was just trying to keep you safe.

136
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,521
By shooting Roy?

137
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:13,025
I...I'm just saying.

138
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,161
Maybe you should
let this go.

139
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:22,318
So...

140
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,036
Are you going
to let this go?

141
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,471
No.

142
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:28,040
But now we're going
to do things my way.

143
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,353
Mom!

144
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,022
Hello!

145
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,726
Shado?

146
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:05,594
You can't be here.

147
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:09,331
I had to see you.

148
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,084
Had to warn you.
Warn me?

149
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,353
You can't fight what's coming.

150
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,089
Put down your bow.

151
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,858
Take off my father's hood.

152
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,744
I wear that hood
to honor your father.

153
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:24,263
And to honor you.

154
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:29,768
If you want to honor me,
stop fighting...and live.

155
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,239
Or everyone you love will die.

156
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:36,258
Ollie?

157
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,578
Who were you
talking to?

158
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:04,103
Get over there!

159
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,099
Mirakuru.

160
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:38,337
Take them.

161
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,274
Anthony...

162
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,843
You got what
you wanted.

163
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,563
You can let them go.

164
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,298
If you ever
cared about me.

165
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,067
But I do care about you, Sara.

166
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:55,654
Which is why
I won't choose to kill you.

167
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:57,539
But he might.

168
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,627
What are you
talking about?

169
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,079
Time to choose, Oliver.

170
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,299
Who lives, and who dies.

171
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,468
But pick quickly,
because in 30 seconds,

172
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,470
I will shoot them both.

173
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:21,146
The incubation
process has begun.

174
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:24,767
Serum will be ready
for distribution in 48 hours.

175
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,436
Two days.

176
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:32,441
And we will be able to create
a hundred more like you.

177
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,195
And the people
who run this city

178
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:39,882
will see what
real power looks like.

179
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:50,225
I knew the Vigilante
had partners.

180
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:51,894
He likes to be called
the Arrow now.

181
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,396
You three have messed
with some really nasty people.

182
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:57,616
The Doll Maker,
Count Vertigo,

183
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,651
Dodger, The Huntress.

184
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,520
We weren't
keeping score.

185
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:03,305
I was.

186
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:05,157
Barry.

187
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,244
The rat poison that you gave
me...are there any side effects?

188
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:14,083
Um, yeah, I think
hallucinations, maybe.

189
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,834
And excessive sweating.

190
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:17,953
Are you sweating
excessively?

191
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,338
You're
hallucinating?

192
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,373
What are you
seeing?

193
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,494
A girl named Shado
that was with me on the island.

194
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,629
Shado.

195
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,381
Sara.

196
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,049
How many women were
you marooned with?

197
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:33,018
Are you sure
this wasn't fantasy island?

198
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,471
You did train in a jungle
or forest environment,

199
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:38,006
hence the green.

200
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,694
Hey, let me draw some
blood, see what's up.

201
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:45,481
Hey, can I ask you
something?

202
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,866
Why no mask?

203
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:52,488
Not to tell you how to
do your vigilante...ing,

204
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,741
but the grease paint
thing?

205
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:58,076
It's a poor
identity concealer.

206
00:11:58,078 --> 00:11:59,962
So find me a mask that conforms
perfectly to my face

207
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,915
and doesn't affect my ability
to aim while I'm on the run.

208
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,800
You should look into
a compressible micro fabric.

209
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,835
It could be great.
Found Cyrus Gold.

210
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,754
Who's Cyrus Gold?

211
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,390
The human weapon that left you
nearly dead the other night.

212
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:14,343
The kid did manage
to pull his print off your neck.

213
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,145
I've had facial
recognition software

214
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,896
scanning closed circuit
cameras all over town.

215
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:20,849
He's at the corner
of Delgado and 25th right now,

216
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,317
but we're just about
to lose him.

217
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,902
What else is at
that intersection?

218
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:25,771
A parking lot,
a market, a motel.

219
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,773
Could be where he's holed up.

220
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,776
I got this.
Oliver...

221
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,229
Why don't let me
handle this one?

222
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,848
It's just recon.

223
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,115
Fine.

224
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,501
But I'm going
as your back-up.

225
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,541
Don't worry.

226
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:46,959
I'll figure out what's
wrong with Oliver.

227
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:48,627
You'd be the first.

228
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,520
Secret admirer?

229
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:01,473
No, actually,
they're from my father.

230
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,592
What brings you by?

231
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:06,445
We need your help.
Cindy's friend was murdered,

232
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,447
but the police aren't
going to investigate.

233
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,566
They said that he ODed,
end of story.

234
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:13,202
Check this out.

235
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,237
He earned extra money
donating blood.

236
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,039
We found it in Max's apartment.
They wouldn't have accepted

237
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,940
his blood if he was
using, right?

238
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,077
Max went missing
the same day as the blood drive.

239
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,129
If he did
donate blood there,

240
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,865
maybe they at least know
something that happened to him.

241
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,083
I'll ask around.

242
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,585
Thank you, Laurel.

243
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,597
If you get bored, I keep a book
of crossword puzzles in the glove box.

244
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,348
That's not funny.

245
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,538
Ok, what do you see?

246
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,523
It's clean.

247
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:52,941
Really clean.

248
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,414
"Solomon Grundy,
born on a Monday."

249
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,999
Christened on Tuesday.

250
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,752
I know the poem.
It symbolizes the seven stages of life--

251
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,820
from birth to death.

252
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:08,540
What stage is this guy in?

253
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:36,785
Go, go, go, go, go!

254
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,408
He picked me up
like I was nothing.

255
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,460
- Felicity, call for back-up.
- On it.

256
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:58,674
This about Sara?

257
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,676
You heard from her?

258
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,845
No.

259
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,314
I'm sorry,
this is...

260
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:08,100
This is
something else.

261
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,568
Cyrus Gold.

262
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,153
He robbed
the Applied Sciences Division

263
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,888
of Queen Consolidated
last week.

264
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,991
Detective...

265
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,859
He's extremely
dangerous.

266
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:19,928
The CSI kid from Central City,

267
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,060
he said this guy was like
some kind of monster.

268
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,449
He is.

269
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,733
Well, what is it, steroids?

270
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,702
Worse. It's--

271
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,522
it's...

272
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,342
Well, assuming I believe
you, why come to me?

273
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:35,243
I've been
compromised.

274
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,294
What does that mean?

275
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,180
It means I'd be
a liability.

276
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,631
You have to take my word
on this, Detective.

277
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,317
Gather as many men
as you can,

278
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,119
and do not hesitate
to kill Cyrus Gold.

279
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,721
Because if given
the opportunity,

280
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,056
he'll do the same
to you.

281
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,875
You don't have
to do this!

282
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:09,494
You got what
you came for!

283
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,046
Just take it and go!

284
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:13,331
10 seconds.

285
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,916
You freaking
psychopath!

286
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,386
History will make that judgment.

287
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,721
Five seconds.

288
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:26,094
Time's up.

289
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:28,513
No, no!

290
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,733
I guess you made
your choice.

291
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,686
No!

292
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,214
Hi.
Hi.

293
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,248
What are you
doing here?

294
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,550
I came by to see Thea.

295
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:58,303
Oh. Go on in.

296
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:01,306
She's upstairs
in her room.

297
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,558
I noticed on the drive up
that your house

298
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,727
wasn't festooned
with Christmas decorations.

299
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,478
Well, we didn't feel
very much like

300
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,430
festooning
this year.

301
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,182
I know what you mean.

302
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:13,701
I remember last Christmas,

303
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:17,138
Tommy and I came here
for your party.

304
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,409
It was one of the best holidays
I'd had in a really long time.

305
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:26,030
Anyway, I should probably
go talk to Thea.

306
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:29,167
I checked into
the blood drive,

307
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,468
and it's all legitimate.

308
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,253
In fact, what
Sebastian's done

309
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,389
has helped save
a lot of lives.

310
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,224
So if the blood drive
is on the up and up,

311
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:38,326
then how are we supposed
to find Max's killer?

312
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:40,678
There's one
other thing.

313
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,097
All of the blood
donors at the drive

314
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,766
were subjected
to a psych evaluation

315
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:46,851
by the Langford
Institute.

316
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,105
Is that, like, legal?

317
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,324
It's not entirely
out of the norm.

318
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:55,337
And while someone
at the institute might know

319
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:56,745
if Max was on drugs,

320
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:59,781
there's no way of finding out
without a warrant.

321
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:01,833
Which we're certainly
not going to get.

322
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,285
I'm sorry
I couldn't be more help.

323
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,120
What are you doing?

324
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:09,340
Uh, just messing around
with something.

325
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:11,009
Shouldn't you be
trying to figure out

326
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,094
what's causing Oliver's
hallucinations?

327
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:16,948
Sample's still being scanned.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

328
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,167
You're really worried
about him, huh?

329
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,770
He takes crazy chances.

330
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:24,973
Even when he's not
hallucinating

331
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,891
about beautiful
island girls.

332
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,394
Hmm.

333
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:33,147
The other night,
I asked you if you liked Oliver.

334
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,400
I told you.
I don't.

335
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,518
I remember.

336
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,955
But if you did...

337
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,324
I could see why.

338
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,793
I mean, Oliver Queen.

339
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,779
He is a billionaire by day

340
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:50,465
and saves the city by night.

341
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,367
Sounds like
you want to date him.

342
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,589
I just have a little experience
with liking someone

343
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,876
who doesn't see you
the same way.

344
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:11,152
Protests continue
into the final countdown

345
00:19:11,154 --> 00:19:12,994
for tonight's ignition of
S.T.A.R. Lab's

346
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,870
controversial
particle accelerator.

347
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,925
S.T.A.R. Lab's founder Harrison Wells
promises a new era

348
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:20,661
of scientific
advancement is at hand.

349
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:23,998
I guess I won't be back in time
to see them turn it on.

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,833
I know, it sounds crazy.

351
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:27,785
Human weapons?

352
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,587
Look, his name is Cyrus Gold.

353
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,539
He's the one that broke into
Queen Consolidated last week.

354
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,124
He's the one that
robbed the blood bank.

355
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,960
And he killed
all those people.

356
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:38,846
Where are you
getting all this intel?

357
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,800
Oh, man, what's
a matter with you?

358
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,969
Talking to the Vigilante's what
got you demoted in the first place.

359
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,055
Look, we take a small squad.

360
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,924
McCarthy and Evans
from SWAT, Jones.

361
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,642
We can bring this guy down.

362
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,678
I promised Jeannie
I'd take her Christmas shopping.

363
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,063
Lucas.

364
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:57,065
Please.

365
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,733
Fine.

366
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:00,368
But you get to call
Jeanie and tell her

367
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,652
I'm not taking her
shopping.

368
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:04,038
Hey, sir. I don't
mean to overstep,

369
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,823
but could you guys
use an extra man?

370
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,280
Grab a vest, Officer Daily.

371
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,120
The police are onto Gold.

372
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,922
They're looking for him.

373
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,390
I made sure
I'm in the loop.

374
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,459
We are too close
to let the police interfere.

375
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,596
Brother Cyrus.

376
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:31,232
The police
are eager to meet you.

377
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:33,734
Introduce yourself.

378
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:38,239
So, any plans for Christmas?

379
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,608
Lighting my menorah.

380
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,276
Hey.

381
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,912
Hi. How are you feeling?

382
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:46,998
Fine. Just...

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,666
It's a little bit
crowded at my house,

384
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:51,752
and I wanted to come
down here to get a little privacy.

385
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:53,421
Yeah.

386
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:54,839
Come on, Barry.

387
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:57,008
We can watch the countdown
at Big Belly Burger.

388
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,493
Your blood analysis
is almost done.

389
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,712
Thank you.

390
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:25,653
What's the matter, kid?

391
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:29,690
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

392
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,492
Are you sure he's in?

393
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,794
Yes, sir. Sector car
spotted Cyrus Gold entering.

394
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,196
He hasn't left.

395
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,331
Safeties off.

396
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:54,542
This is a nice place.

397
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:55,910
It's a bit more
comfortable

398
00:22:55,912 --> 00:22:58,212
than the fuselage
on the island.

399
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,580
You're not real.

400
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:01,549
Neither are you.

401
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:04,418
You told everyone
when you started this crusade

402
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,187
that it was about

403
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:10,258
making up
for your father's sins.

404
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,427
That was a lie.

405
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,431
This charade is to atone
for your sins.

406
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,100
You're dead.

407
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,968
You are not a hero.

408
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,737
Or a friend.

409
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,906
Or a brother.
You are nothing.

410
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:28,242
Do not turn your back on me,

411
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:30,477
not again.

412
00:23:31,597 --> 00:23:35,232
You're gone.

413
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,618
Wherever I am...

414
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,487
It's time you joined me.

415
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,379
They say a coward
dies a thousand deaths.

416
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:50,798
But even that wouldn't
be enough for you.

417
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,933
I tried to save you!

418
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:54,635
And her.

419
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:56,437
But you couldn't.

420
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,889
Just like you couldn't
save this city.

421
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:18,025
The island didn't
make you strong, kid.

422
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:20,527
It revealed you to be weak.

423
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:41,772
Thank you for being
my shopping guide.

424
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:43,134
Are you ok?

425
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,353
Uh, yeah, it's just, um,

426
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:47,188
can I ask you a question?

427
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,641
It's about the blood drive
you sponsored.

428
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:51,476
Of course.
It's a wonderful cause.

429
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:54,028
Especially with the underfunded
hospitals we're dealing with.

430
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,596
What about it?

431
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,735
Hello?

432
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:04,856
What?!

433
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:07,425
Ok, I'll be right over.

434
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,911
What happened?

435
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:11,830
My father. Um...

436
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:14,833
He's in the ICU.
I'm so sorry.

437
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,584
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

438
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:19,204
I'm sorry.

439
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:28,229
What happened
in here?

440
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:30,448
Did someone break in?
No.

441
00:25:31,768 --> 00:25:34,402
Your blood analysis
is done. Good news.

442
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:36,688
So you know
what's in my system?

443
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,774
That's the thing--
your blood's clean.

444
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,075
There's nothing
wrong with you.

445
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,360
Then why am I hallucinating?!

446
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:43,661
I don't know.

447
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,246
But whatever
your problem is,

448
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:46,865
it's not pharmacological.
It's psychological.

449
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,200
It's in your head.
It's in my head.

450
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,652
Oh, my God.

451
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,922
Oliver.

452
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:01,629
Dad!

453
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,615
Honey.

454
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,333
Honey.

455
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:10,388
Well, I can wiggle my toes,
it must be a good sign.

456
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,976
I'm all right,
honey, I'm fine.

457
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:16,978
How's Lucas, is he all right?

458
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,732
I--I'm sorry.

459
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:24,068
What do you mean?

460
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,797
I got to call Jeannie.
I got to call his wife.

461
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,467
No, Dad, I'll do it.
You just...stay here.

462
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:42,420
Get some rest.

463
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:57,819
What are you
doing here?

464
00:26:57,821 --> 00:27:00,605
Wanted to make sure
your father was ok.

465
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:03,024
He is.

466
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,994
I wanted to make sure
you were, too.

467
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,627
How are you, Detective?

468
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:26,230
I'm alive.

469
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:28,766
Unlike most everyone else
in my unit.

470
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:31,469
I'm sorry
about your partner.

471
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:33,871
I took him in there.

472
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:36,524
Because of me.

473
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:37,608
I hate to disappoint you,

474
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:40,367
but not every death
in this city is on you.

475
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:45,400
I got this off Gold.

476
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,318
Hopefully you can
do something with it.

477
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,237
I didn't believe it
at first, but this guy,

478
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,706
I mean, it's like
he's not human.

479
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,377
He's human.

480
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,163
Well, then you can kill him.

481
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:02,000
For Hilton. And me.

482
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:11,509
I think those
are sharp enough.

483
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:18,266
Apparently I'm not.

484
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:20,735
Diggle, do you think
I'm losing my mind?

485
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:25,773
No more than
the rest of us.

486
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:27,608
I saw...

487
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,446
Slade Wilson.

488
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:34,916
Slade was my friend
on the island,

489
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,834
and...

490
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:41,789
like Shado,
he is dead because of me.

491
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,657
Mr. Lance
just told me

492
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,794
that not every
death in this city is my fault.

493
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,597
Fine.

494
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,883
There are plenty
that are.

495
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:54,168
When I got home
from Afghanistan, I...

496
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,971
saw a ghost, too.

497
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:59,006
Survivor's guilt.

498
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,841
Why us, not them.

499
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,527
I know why.

500
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,113
Then the "why's"
not your problem.

501
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:08,066
How'd you make
your ghost go away?

502
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:11,685
I figured out what they were
trying to tell me.

503
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,187
Which was?

504
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:15,656
That's for me to hear, Oliver.

505
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:18,376
You have to figure out what
yours is trying to tell you.

506
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:19,911
Guys, we got
something here.

507
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:21,913
I scanned the key
Lance gave you,

508
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:24,165
and traced its serial code
back to the manufacturer.

509
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,134
This particular key
fits a locked gate

510
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:28,336
somewhere on Crescent Circle
in the Glades.

511
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,557
Where are you going?

512
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,842
You can't go out there
in your condition.

513
00:29:34,844 --> 00:29:36,727
I have to stop this.

514
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:38,546
Oliver, Gold
left you half dead,

515
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,598
which is 50 percent better than
how he left Detective Hilton.

516
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Felicity...

517
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:44,152
I don't have
a choice.

518
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:46,604
I'll come back.

519
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:48,722
Promise me.

520
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,703
It's ready.

521
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:19,566
Is this where you killed
Max Stanton, hmm?

522
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:20,399
What are you doing?

523
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:21,944
If you stick that
in me, I'll kill you.

524
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,434
No, brother Roy.

525
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:27,169
You'll kill for me.

526
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,147
Brother Cyrus
told me he killed you.

527
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:40,383
Guess he's not as strong
as you'd hoped.

528
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:44,370
Where'd you get the Mirakiru?
Who gave you the formula?!

529
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:48,887
It was a gift. A gift I would use
to save this city from itself.

530
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,652
Another failure.

531
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,273
Get up, Oliver.

532
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,599
Tommy?

533
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:31,718
You're not going
to die down here.

534
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,670
Tommy, I'm sorry.

535
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,256
I let you die.

536
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,809
You didn't
let me die, Ollie.

537
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:42,929
You fought
to save me.

538
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,630
Because that's
what you do.

539
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,049
What you have
always done.

540
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,301
You fight to survive.

541
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:50,987
I know I called you
a murderer,

542
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:52,472
but you are not.

543
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,974
You are a hero.

544
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:57,326
You beat the island.

545
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,729
You beat my father.

546
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:01,564
So fight, Oliver.

547
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,683
Get up

548
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:07,153
and fight back.

549
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,021
Kill him.

550
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,984
Hey. I am not leaving
anyone else to die!

551
00:33:54,986 --> 00:33:56,152
You're strong, kid.

552
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:58,454
Come on! Come on!

553
00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,989
Come on, Roy!

554
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,992
Fight. Come on, fight!

555
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:21,831
Roy?!

556
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,734
Hey, Roy!

557
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:28,037
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you!

558
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,522
I was...

559
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:34,010
I was running down
another lead.

560
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:36,262
It didn't pan out.

561
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,681
I thought you were
chasing after the Vigilante again.

562
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:41,584
I got so scared. I thought
something happened to you.

563
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:42,986
Hey, hey, don't worry.

564
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:46,255
I'm alive.

565
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:52,128
I want to serve
the people of Starling,

566
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,482
not the men and women
who think they own it.

567
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,151
Together, we can help
rebuild our city

568
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:02,155
into a place where there are
no elites and no oppressed.

569
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:05,675
Where we are all
brothers and sisters.

570
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:09,979
So your campaign begins.

571
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,315
The city
needs a leader.

572
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:14,017
And putting
the copycat hoods

573
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,886
up to assassinating
the mayor was just the first step.

574
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,759
The Vigilante...

575
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:24,344
He destroyed
the centrifuge

576
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:26,062
and the serum
along with it.

577
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,932
I will arrange for you to receive
another sample of my blood,

578
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:33,236
and then you can begin
to mass produce the serum again.

579
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:36,706
When I ask you not
to confront the Vigilante,

580
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,391
you will listen.

581
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:43,029
Remember, your mask
can be worn by another.

582
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:47,116
You know who he is
under that hood, don't you?

583
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:51,588
I know exactly who he is.

584
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,724
He's my friend.

585
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:57,176
That's why you don't
want him dead.

586
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,345
Death would be
a release from this life,

587
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:02,932
and his sentence is yet
to be carried out.

588
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:08,508
I am going to tear everything
he cares about away from him.

589
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:16,679
Destroy those who choose
to follow him.

590
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:22,068
Corrupt those he loves.

591
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,487
Once he has lost everyone

592
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,624
and everything he values...

593
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:32,361
I will drive an arrow
through his eye.

594
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:54,434
Shado...

595
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:59,555
Shado!

596
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:16,706
Ahhh!

597
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,191
No!

598
00:37:50,674 --> 00:37:52,742
Why?

599
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,594
I...

600
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:56,579
Ivo just shot her.

601
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,581
He didn't say why.

602
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,668
Whoever did this to her...

603
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,753
is going to suffer.

604
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,458
Still have a ghost problem?

605
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,427
No.

606
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,896
I got the message.

607
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:16,540
But we...

608
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,424
We have other problems.

609
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,426
Wouldn't be us
if we didn't.

610
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,745
Roy was injected
with the serum.

611
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,547
Oh, my God, is he ok?

612
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,100
He's alive.

613
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:30,219
But we are going
to have to keep an eye on him.

614
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,504
And Cyrus Gold?

615
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:34,190
Died on Saturday,
buried on Sunday.

616
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,442
But he was working
with someone.

617
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:37,727
I saw him,
he wore a mask

618
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,781
with the image
of a...of a skull.

619
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:44,600
He's trying to mass produce
the serum to build an army.

620
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,101
For what?

621
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:48,404
You're a soldier.

622
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,873
What's the primary
purpose of an army?

623
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,776
War.

624
00:38:58,949 --> 00:38:59,876
Where's Barry?

625
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:01,756
He went back to Central City.
Oh.

626
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,939
Wanted to get home in time to see
them turn on the particle accelerator.

627
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:10,560
I should take this.

628
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,030
Hi.

629
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:15,281
Hey

630
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:16,950
Did you make it?

631
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:19,536
I made it back
to Central City in time,

632
00:39:19,538 --> 00:39:22,622
but I missed the cut off
in line at S.T.A.R. Labs.

633
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,375
I was late, as usual.

634
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:29,712
But in spirit
of not being late again,

635
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:32,849
uh, if you ever decide that

636
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,801
Oliver Queen
isn't the guy for you;

637
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,686
if you decide that

638
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,972
you want to go
on a date with

639
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:41,774
someone else, um...

640
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:45,928
You should know that
that guy, he'll be on time.

641
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,480
Good to know.

642
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:49,983
Oh, hey, and I left
something for Oliver.

643
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:51,401
I hope he likes it.

644
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:52,652
Bye, Barry.

645
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,821
Bye, Felicity.

646
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:02,598
I'm Linda Park and we're live
outside  S.T.A.R. Labs

647
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,595
despite the inclement weather,
which is only going to get worse.

648
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:08,797
The torrential downpour has
driven away almost all the protesters

649
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:11,030
though S.T.A.R. Labs
CEO Harrison Wells has assured us

00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:15,118
that the storm tonight will in
no way affect the particle accelerator,

651
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,654
which is up
and running smoothly.

652
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:27,430
Wait, we are now
being told to evacuate the facility.

653
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:29,349
The storm may have
caused a malfunction

654
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,167
to the primary
cooling system.

655
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:33,669
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator,

656
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:36,639
but so far have been unable
to regain control of the system.

657
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:38,350
Even the Arrow deserves
a Christmas present.

658
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,687
Here.

659
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:53,531
How do I look?

660
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:56,368
Like a hero.
