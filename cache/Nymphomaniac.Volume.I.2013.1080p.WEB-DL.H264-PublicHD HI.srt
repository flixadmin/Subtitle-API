you have to have
a line that is heavy.

At the same time,
it is so cleverly arranged

258
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,555
that if you take a left turn,

259
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:47,057
you will also arrive
at a lavatory,

260

<i>In no time, b was ahead,</i>
<i>five to three.</i>

265
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,435
And it was exactly right...

266
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,471
look them in the eye and smile.

267
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,574
But then suddenly it stopped.

268
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:40,578
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

269
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,646
As it happens,

270
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,415
either none
of the fish are feeding

271
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,550
or they all feed
at the same time.

272
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,752
They go into feeding frenzy.

273
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,488
All bite.

274
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,891
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

275
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,994
The fish most readily bite at
the beginning of a light rain,

276
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,430
and I think that's
because they feel safe

277
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,098
when they swim in the stream.

278
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,834
Because they can't
be seen from above.

279
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,504
The water's surface
is disturbed.

280
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,608
But then it started again,

281
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,444
although a bit more slowly.

282
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,946
Yeah, and I think I know how.

283
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,849
Because fly-fishing can
be done in several phases.

284
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,153
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

285
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,757
And in phase two,
you not only imitate an insect

286
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,226
but an insect in trouble.

287
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:32,596
You pull... you pull the line.

288
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,566
You tug it... Irregularly,

289
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,501
<i>so the fish gets</i>
<i>the impression that</i>

290
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,137
it's dealing with an
injured and easy prey.

291
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,206

292

<i>let the fly float</i>
<i>down the river again.</i>

293

Then half-heartedly

294
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,079
<i>make a few jumps forward again.</i>

295
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,750
It can be done...

296
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,718

00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,656
Betty was excited.

318
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:10,060
Joe's voice: <i>One of nature's
most meaningless creatures.</i>

319
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,930
Seligman's voice: <i>You're aware
that the choice of a dwarf hamster</i>

320
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,033
<i>possibly suggests</i>
<i>certain sexual connotations.</i>

321
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,668
Joe's voice:
<i>I can see that now,</i>

322
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,771
<i>but it was really</i>
<i>not a conscious choice.</i>

323
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,117
Can you show me
where the lavatory is?

324
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,321
I... have to blow my nose.

325
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,002
Joe's voice: <i>We were
running out of subjects,</i>

326
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,271
<i>and b was ahead on points,</i>

327
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:58,275
<i>which led us to s's</i>
<i>first-class compartment.</i>

328
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,348
Conductor: <i>Tickets, please!</i>

329
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,288
Thank you.

330
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,690
<i>Ladies?</i>

331
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,359
Tickets?

332
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,766
Young Joe: <i>Well...</i>

333
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,904
I think I might've lost it.

334
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,138
Conductor: <i>Perhaps.</i>

335
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,076
Dropped yours as well, did ya?

336
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:36,080
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

337
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,148
It's so bloody slow,

338
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,117
we should've been at the end
of the track half an hour ago.

339
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,287
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

340
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,823
£8 each, please.

341
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,259
Oh!

342
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,263
I accidentally tore it up.

343
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,300
<i>You can't expect be to pay</i>
<i>for scraps of paper.</i>

344
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,669
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

345
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,871
Oh, that one's disappeared too.

346
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,940
( Laughs ) - Conductor:<i>I can
always just get the police</i>

347
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,942
to collect your payment
at the next station.

348
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,044
How about that? - Now let's
just take it easy here, shall we?

349
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:10,047
Apparently the young ladies
have left without any money.

350
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,349
If it's okay with you, I'd
like to pay for their tickets.

351
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,252
No sir, it's not. Just leave
your money where it is.

352
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,121
We'll let the police deal
with these two. - Actually,

353
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,723
we did have sort of an
agreement that I was to pay.

354
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,058
I just forgot about it.

355
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,696
I see.

356
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,265
Two first-class tickets...

357
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,868
For two first-class ladies.

358
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,171
<i>Enjoy the rest of your journey.</i>

359
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,809
<i>Tickets, please!</i>

360
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,947
B: Now that you've
been so nice to us...

361
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,951
We'd like to be
nice to you too.

362
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,486
S: <i>Oh, that's very kind of you,</i>

363
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,954
<i>but there's no need.</i>

364
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,027
I mean that.

365
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,900
Well, I've already lost anyway.

366
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:09,373
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

367
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,077
If you can get
that one in there.

368
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,850
Joe's voice: <i>I decided,
perhaps a bit desperately,</i>

369
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,952
<i>that the only thing</i>
<i>standing between me</i>

370
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,987
<i>and the bag of chocolate sweets</i>

371
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,358
<i>was an unequivocal</i>
<i>provocation of this man.</i>

372
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,061
Seligman's voice:
<i>Excellent. An induced take.</i>

373
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,463
<i>When all other attempts fail,</i>

374
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,265
<i>a dramatic provocation can get</i>

375
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,001
<i>an otherwise completely</i>
<i>passive fish to bite.</i>

376
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,205
<i>They will react instinctively</i>
<i>to the right provocation,</i>

377
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,041
<i>which would not be a fly,</i>
<i>but, for instance,</i>

378
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,845
<i>a brightly-colored wobbler,</i>
<i>preferably red.</i>

379
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,347
<i>The very best is one we call</i>
<i>"the Finnish weapon,"</i>

380
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,050
<i>the so-called rapala.</i>

381
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,387
Young Joe:
<i>You've bought a gift.</i>

382
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,591
Yes.

383
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,494
- It's for my wife.
- <i> Oh.</i>

384
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,564
You travel first-class

385
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,234
and you bought us our tickets.

386
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:14,338
<i>Why then not buy</i>
<i>a decent gift for your wife?</i>

387
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,407
I can see it comes
from the station.

388
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,415
<i>Of course, I should have...</i>

389
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,017
<i>Bought her something...</i>

390
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,953
something better, but...

391
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,357
<i>Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.</i>

392
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,861
<i>Why would a man like you</i>

393
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,964
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

394
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,403
It has to do with family.

395
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,541
My wife and I
have decided that we...

396
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,547
We miss having children
after all,

397
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,350
and that if we are to have
children, it has to be now.

398
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,056
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

399
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,425
<i>she started ovulating.</i>

400
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,896
<i>And all signs point</i>
<i>to maximum fertility</i>

401
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,065
<i>precisely tonight.</i>

402
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,100
You see...

403
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,270
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

404
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,206
<i>I had to get a ticket home</i>
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

405
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,977
Well, I understand now.

406
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,413
<i>What is it you understand?</i>

407
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:32,115
Why you didn't
have sex with us.

408
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,622
It wasn't because
I didn't want to.

409
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,140
<i>( Whispering ) Please.</i>

410
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,014
I'm begging you, please don't.

411
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,049
It's okay.

412
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,719
Please don't.

413
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,190
You've been as horny as hell...

414
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,326
But you wouldn't
give up your load.

415
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,129
Please stop.

416
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,108

417
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,751

00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,023
Oh God.

Oh God.

421
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,744
Wow.

423
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,392
Seligman: <i>So oral sex</i>

424

<i>your... your Finnish weapon.</i>

Joe's voice:
<i>Is that your only comment?</i>

427
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,839
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

428
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,110
That I behaved reprehensively,

429
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:44,114
that already my actions
exemplify that I'm a...

I'm a terrible human being.

431

That's not the way I see it.

432
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,788
On the contrary,
I saw it as a...

433
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,025
as a very pleasurable
and humorous story.

434
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:58,562
I've consciously
used and hurt others...

435
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,732
For the sake
of my own satisfaction.

436
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,669
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

<i>But when you told</i>

<i>The only thing you've done...</i>

Except giving a few people

is that you... you
relieved s from his load

<i>in some... some youthful hubris.</i>

443
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,258
And I read somewhere that

444
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,793
the sperm will die.

You said you weren't religious.

No, but my
great-grandfather was.

470

475
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,750
as certain political powers
try to convince us.

476
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,720
Seligman...

477
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,456
Means "the happy one."

478
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,728
So are you happy then?

479
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,566
Well, I suppose I am...

480
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,402
In my own way.

481
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,205
Even if I'm the kind of person

482
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,274
who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

483
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,408
What does that mean?

484
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,911
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

485
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,714
The people who cut the nails
on the left hand first

486
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,583
and the people
who cut the nails

487
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,319
of the right hand first.
My theory is

488
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,821
<i>that the people who cut the
nails of the left hand first,</i>

489
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,357
<i>they... they...</i>
<i>they're more light-hearted.</i>

490
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,626
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more

491
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,363
because they go straight
for the easiest task and...

492
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,733
Save their difficulties
for later.

493
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,340
So what do you do?

494
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,510
Always the left hand first.

495
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,578
I don't think there's a choice.

496
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,382
Go for the pleasure
first, always.

497
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,452
And then once
you've done the left hand,

498
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,888
only the right hand remains,

499
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,091
and that's
the easiest one left.

500
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,334
I've never thought
of it like that.

501
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,505
Well, you...
you're never too old...

502
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,007
never too old to learn.

503
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,850
<i>That's rugelach.</i>

504
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,587
Mm-hmm. It's a Jewish cake.

505
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,356
<i>There's that</i>
<i>sentimentality again.</i>

506
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,291
No, but it's more
than rugelach.

507
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:23,893
<i>It's rugelach served</i>
<i>with a cake fork.</i>

508
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,031
Rugelach, in my opinion,
is pastry,

509
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,701
which there is no excuse for
eating with a cake fork.

510
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,472
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

511
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,074
<i>not to say downright feminine.</i>

512
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,947
However it can bring us
further with the story.

513
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:50,754
I also knew someone who
consumed rugelach every day,

514
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,757
almost ritually,
with a cake fork.

515
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,826
<i>And although we'll be</i>
<i>jumping a bit in time...</i>

516
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,398
<i>I have to tell you</i>
<i>about Jerome.</i>

517
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,534
As far as I can see, the
next chapter doesn't contain

518
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,637
as direct an accusation
against my person

519
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,006
as the rest of the story.

520
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:14,444
The chapter will also make a
sentimental soul like you happy,

521
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:19,416
as it contains observations
on the subject of love.

522

<i>( Young Joe grunting, moaning )</i>

526
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,651
Sure.

527
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,520
Sure.

528
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,654
Yeah.

529
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,789
Yeah sure.

530
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,691
It might not be
important to you...

531
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,892
But it is to me.

532
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,760
But it is to me.

533
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,763
I've never had
an orgasm before.

534
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,902
Really?

00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,108
You're my first one.

00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,913
You don't know
how happy that makes me.

538

( Both laugh )

539
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,186
I love you.

( Whispers ) You're my first.

542
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,832
Well, I have to admit:

543
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,201
Quite a lot of girls say that.

546
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,776

<i>Mea vulva, mea...</i>

seligman's voice:
<i>That's interesting.</i>

557
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,636
Blasphemic, satanic.

558
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,005
The music...

559
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,141
the interval between b and f...

560
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,076
it's a tritone,

561
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,078
the devil's interval.

562
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,048
It was banned from music
in the middle ages.

563
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,085
Well, the vacuum cleaner
invented it.

564
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,187
She took piano lessons.

565
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,289
The vacuum cleaner?

566
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,924
<i>The vacuum cleaner possessed</i>

567
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,061
<i>a special talent</i>
<i>for floppy cocks.</i>

568

<i>She had some kind</i>
<i>of vacuum in her cunt.</i>

569
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,668
I... I was imagining
something like that.

570
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,170
It was about fucking

571
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,906
and about having
the right to be horny.

572
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,977
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

573
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,813
But it was rebellious.

574
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,883
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

575
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,720
No fucking the same guy
more than once.

576
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,788
What did you rebel against?

577
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,256
Love.

578
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,892
Love?

579
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,095
We were committed to combat

580
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,364
the love-fixated society.

- Third.

590

Haven't we stated
that we fuck each guy once?

591

I don't think

There you are.

Do you think you know
everything about sex?

596
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,290
( Whispers ) The secret
ingredient to sex... is love.

597
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:04,934
For me, love was just
lust with jealousy added.

598
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:08,137
Everything else
was total nonsense.

599
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:12,809
For every hundred crimes
committed in the name of love,

600
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,912
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

601
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,214
That's quite a statement.

602
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,050
Well, it all
strengthened my wish

603
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,086
for a serious education.

604
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,266
Glasgow.

605
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,371

Joe: <i>Why are you smiling?</i>

607
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:49,812
Oh, I just pictured
how an education

608
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,948
would be conveyed in your storytelling.
( Chuckles )

609
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,051
Well, that's nothing
to smile about.

610
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,353
I understand that.

611
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,791
So what kind
of education did you get?

612
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:05,428
I began studying medicine
like my father.

613
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,898
<i>But it was harder and harder
for me to concentrate,</i>

614
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,336
<i>so I studied less and less
till finally I dropped out.</i>

615
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,040
So instead I began
to look for a job.

616
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,745
<i>It turned out</i>
<i>it was hard to get a job</i>

617
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,047
<i>that paid</i>
<i>even halfway decently.</i>

618
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,918
<i>I didn't really know</i>
<i>how to do anything,</i>

619
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,454
<i>so I didn't have high hopes</i>

620
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,089
<i>when I applied for a position</i>

621

<i>as an assistant</i>
<i>at a printing house.</i>

622
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:39,095
So could you tell me
a little bit more

623
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,798
<i>about your background?</i>

624
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,068
- Um...
- <i> Education-wise.</i>

625
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,172
Oh. Well,
I finished high school

626
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,842
and decided
to study medicine...

627
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,045
But I didn't finish.

628
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,815
<i>I know it sounds</i>
<i>a bit pointless coming here.</i>

629
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:01,250
- Right.
- <i> I just really need a job</i>

630
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,286
and I've tried everywhere.

631
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,288
<i>I don't usually</i>
<i>give jobs to people</i>

632
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,256

Yes, quite surprising.

Surprising?

673
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,960
It's a sign from God.

Usually, you know,

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>- But he's developed
a bit of a tummy problem,

679
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,915
so he's at the spa,
taking long baths,

680
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,616

Poor guy.

<i>who had declared war.</i>

792

<i>Many times</i>
<i>he'd take me into town,</i>

793
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,434
<i>just so I could hold his coat.</i>

794
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,403
- Young Joe: There.
- Jerome:<i> Where?</i>

795
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,872
There, behind the green car.

796
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,442
It's not big enough.

797
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:22,444
<i>It is, there's plenty of space.</i>

798
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,513
<i>( Sighs ) I saw it.</i>

799
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:25,981
It's not enough space.

800
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,083
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>there's plenty of space.</i>

801
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,555
( Scoffs, mutters )

802
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,024
No.

803
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,930
Can I try?

804
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:44,767
<i>( Sighs ) Can you try?</i>

805
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,635
<i>I'm a wizard at this.</i>

806
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,370
I just tried it.
There's not enough space, Joe.

807
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:50,506
You just saw me do it.
There's not enough space.

808
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,707
Okay?

809
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,476
- Can I try?
- You wanna try?

810
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,647
Why not?

811
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,943
<i>- ( Gear shift clicks )</i>
<i>- ( Engine stops )</i>

812
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,696
Joe's voice:
<i>It was about this time</i>

813
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:51,667
<i>that a dramatic change</i>
<i>happened inside of me.</i>

814
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,471
<i>I could suddenly see</i>

815
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,607
<i>a kind of order in the mess.</i>

816
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,976
It was all very very wrong.

817
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,980
I wanted to be
one of Jerome's things.

818
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,850
I wanted to be picked up

819
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:11,487
and put down again and again.

820
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,922
<i>I wanted to be treated</i>
<i>by his hands,</i>

821
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:17,459
according to some
sophisticated principle

822
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:20,062
that I didn't understand.

823
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,830
His strong hands?

824
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,732
Yes, but now it was

825
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,767
no longer just about his hands.

826
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:29,171
It was as if everything
about him was different,

827
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,673
<i>which of course it wasn't,</i>

828
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,208
<i>and I knew that in my head.</i>

829
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,477
And I scolded myself
for seeing him

830
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,945
in this new light.

831
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,815
Love is blind.

832
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,950
No no no, it's worse.

833
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,454
Love distorts things.

834
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:48,457
Or even worse,
love is something

835
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,526
you've never asked for.

836
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,562
The erotic was
something I asked for

837
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,831
or even demanded of men.

838
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,600
But this idiotic love...

839
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,538
I felt humiliated by it...

840
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,174
And all the dishonesty
that follows.

841
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,979
The erotic is about saying yes.

842
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,717
Love appeals
to the lowest instincts,

843
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,053
wrapped up in lies.

844
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,755
How do you say yes

845
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:22,758
when you mean no
and vice versa?

846
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,064
I'm ashamed of what I became,

847
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,700
but it was beyond my control.

848
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,771
You know what you're doing now?

849
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,574
No, what am I doing?

850
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:41,243
You're defending
your personality.

851
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,246
I thought the point
was to reveal it.

852
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,822
Joe's voice: <i>At this time
I took up walking again.</i>

853
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,657
<i>I walked in the forest.</i>

854
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,631
<i>The forest of my childhood.</i>

855
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,669
<i>I took the same walk</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

856
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,840
<i>Right turn after the gatehouse,</i>

857
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,676
<i>and right again</i>
<i>by the ash tree,</i>

858
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,379
<i>which has the most beautiful</i>
<i>leaves in the forest.</i>

859
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,751
<i>And further on past</i>
<i>the lady with her poodle</i>

860
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:25,253
<i>and the old man on the bench.</i>

861
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,262
<i>I couldn't free myself</i>

862
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:38,033
<i>of the image of Jerome</i>
<i>and his careless elegance.</i>

863
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,577
<i>And during this time,</i>
<i>when I was with other men,</i>

864
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:52,314
<i>I forbade them to touch</i>
<i>my body with their hands.</i>

865
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,317
( Grunting )

866
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:59,655
<i>And soon I stopped</i>
<i>having sex altogether.</i>

867
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,593
<i>I tried to meet him</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

868
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:07,295
<i>I found out where he lived,</i>

869
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:10,265
<i>but of course never dared</i>
<i>ring his doorbell.</i>

870
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,771
<i>I worked for a long time</i>
<i>on a letter</i>

871
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:19,107
<i>in which I told him</i>
<i>about my feelings for him.</i>

872
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,710
<i>A month would pass</i>

873
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,845
<i>before I had built up</i>
<i>enough courage</i>

874
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,048
<i>to deliver it.</i>

875
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:39,027
I'm sorry.
Isn't this Jerome's office?

876
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,265
I'm happy to say
that this never has been

877
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:45,767
and never will be
Jerome's office.

878
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:50,372
But my nephew has been standing
in for me while I've been unwell.

879
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,909
Was that a letter for him?

880
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,344
- Yes.
- <i> Give it to me</i>

881
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:59,181
and I will make sure
he gets it.

882
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,420
I can't promise
when that might be,

883
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,256
as he's long gone.

884
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,192
<i>- ( Briefcase closes )</i>
<i>- How the young finance</i>

885
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:12,928
their irrepressible
desire for travel

886
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,796
is a mystery to me.

887
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,698
So he's gone?

888
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,333
Deserted us, yes.

889
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,003
Raving about
a trip around the world

890
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,339
- and married and all.
- Married?

891
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,174
<i>Married, yes.</i>

892
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,444
<i>Flown the Coop</i>
<i>with my secretary.</i>

893
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,980
Liz.

894
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,123
And your job?

895
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,826
It turned out that
Jerome's Uncle demanded

896
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,195
a bit more knowledge
about the business, so...

897
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,397
that was the end of love then?

898
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,369
Well, maybe it's not
quite as simple.

899
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:58,707
<i>But more about that later,</i>

900
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:00,709
as they say in the novels.

901
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:04,079
And Jerome just disappeared?

902
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,082
Yes, though I tried
to keep him,

903
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,818
in my own way, mentally,

904
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,522
as I masturbated on the train
amongst other people.

905
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,459
You masturbated on the train?

906
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,494
- On the seat?
- Yes, of course.

907
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,563
<i>( Train rattling )</i>

908
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,869
Joe's voice:
<i>I did a Jigsaw puzzle.</i>

909
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,204
Seligman's voice:
<i>A Jigsaw puzzle?</i>

910
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,745
Joe's voice: <i>I found details
in the other passengers</i>

911
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:39,314
<i>that reminded me of Jerome.</i>

912
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,890
<i>But in the long run,</i>

913
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,159
<i>I couldn't hold on</i>
<i>to the details of him,</i>

914
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:26,194
<i>no matter how hard I tried.</i>

915
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,231
Maybe that's
how it is with memory.

916
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:32,467
You... you remember
silhouettes,

917
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,502
the essentials.

918
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,006
But that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

919
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,342
<i>( Water trickling )</i>

920
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,577
Joe's voice: <i>Of course, as
silhouettes in the winter,</i>

921
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:46,381
- <i> the trees are difficult to tell apart.</i>
- See these buds?

922
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,583
Joe's voice: <i>My father
wrestled courageously</i>

<i>with his flora</i>
<i>and tree type guides.</i>

924
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,890
It's actually...

925
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,595
The souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

926
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:03,131
In the summer, everything
is green and idyllic,

927
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:04,966
but in the winter,

928
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,969
the branches and the trunks,
they all stand out.

929
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,604
Just look at how crooked
they all are.

930
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,541
<i>The branches have to carry</i>
<i>all of the leaves</i>

<i>into the sunlight.</i>

932
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,147
<i>It's one long struggle</i>
<i>for survival.</i>

933
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,419
Joe's voice:
<i>My father surprised me</i>

934
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,290
<i>by calling the naked trunks</i>
<i>the souls of the trees.</i>

935
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,059
<i>A poetic thought</i>
<i>that was rare for him,</i>

<i>as by his own account</i>

Well, let's just say,

941
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,076
aggressively.

942
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:49,945
How?

943
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,215
By intensifying
my hunt for men.

944
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,153
<i>You know</i>

<i>And most of all,</i>
<i>I battled my way</i>

It's a present.

A pillow he has

- Mrs. h:<i> And who's it for?</i>
- Daddy.

1066
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,465
I do hope it's all right
if the children call

1067
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:58,800
their father "daddy" here.

1068
01:13:58,802 --> 01:13:59,901
If you prefer,

1069
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:03,438
they can call him "him"

1070
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,707
or simply "the man."

1071
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:09,444
To be honest, my first
thought was never ever

1072
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,379
to let either of you
see the children,

1073

but then I changed my mind.

1074
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:16,384
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

1075
01:14:16,386 --> 01:14:18,886
by the little people
whose lives he has destroyed.

1076
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,523
Give daddy your present.

1077
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,597
<i>It's a car the little dear</i>
<i>has embroidered.</i>

1078
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:33,000
( Clears throat ) I'm aware
that not everyone can see it,

1079
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:36,537
but with the heart
one can see much,

1080
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:39,941
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

1081
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,611
Would it be all right

1082
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:46,581
if I showed the children
the whoring bed?

1083
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:50,852
After all, they also have
a stake in this event.

1084
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,158
<i>You need to see it, right?</i>

So this is
where it all happened.

1090
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:22,450
You should try

especially the bed.

1092
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:28,523
It'll stand you in good
stead later in therapy.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1098
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,607
( Chuckles ) I'm being silly.

1099
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,009
Mommy's being silly.

1100
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,679
Let's have a cup of tea.

1101
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:53,748

( Sighs )

1103
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,197
The children's father likes

1104
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,300
two lumps of sugar in his tea.

1105
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,953
- <i> ( Knocks on door )</i>
- Mrs. h:<i> Mmm!</i>

1106
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,688
- I'll get it.
- Young Joe:<i> Hm-mmm.</i>

1107
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,410
- No no no, please please please.
- <i> Hm-mmm.</i>

1108
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

1109
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,796
- Yes?
- Uh...

1110
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:44,065
Oh, how nice! Lovely.

1111
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:47,201
- Boys. Come here.
- Is Joe here?

1112
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,070
This might be interesting.

1113
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,940
- Hi. Yes.
- This is my son. Yes.

1114
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,543
- Hello hello.
- Good boy. Look him in the eyes.

1115
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:56,811
Man: <i>I'm Andy. Hello.</i>

1116
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,279
Friend of Joe's then?

1117
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,981
- Yeah.
- You known each other long?

1118
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:03,551
- Um, not that long, no.
- Not terribly long?

1119
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:04,819
- No.
- Oh.

1120
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,663
Mrs. h: <i>A menage a trois.</i>

1121
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,233
It's all so exotic.

1122
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:22,336
So... broad-minded.

1123
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,773
On that point...

1124
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,576
I failed.

1125
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,411
No doubt about it.

1126
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,317
Boys, now is
the time to be alert

1127
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,755
and ask all the questions
your hearts' desire,

1128
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:42,890
because...

1129
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:47,695
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

1130
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:50,965
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

1131
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,101
<i>- ( Spoon clatters )</i>
<i>- Well? Hmm?</i>

1132
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,970
<i>You don't have any questions?</i>

1133
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,006
No?

1134
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,443
Well, I'll start, shall I?

1135
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,380
Approximately how many lives

1136
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,684
<i>do you think she has time</i>
<i>to destroy in one day?</i>

1137

- <i> Five?</i>

1138
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,120
<i>50?</i>

1139
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,823
<i>Or several hundreds?</i>

1140
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,463
Look, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

1141
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:28,969
Boys...

1142
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:34,975
- I don't... I don't love your father.
- ( Scoffs )

1143
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:37,311
Mrs. h: <i>She's just saying
that to make us feel better.</i>

1144
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,715
I'm sure you understand that.
( Crying )

1145
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,383
Because if it were
a joke, I mean...

1146
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,320
If... this were really a joke,

1147
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,489
then it would be
a joke so cruel.

1148
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,298
No one can be that cruel.

1149
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:01,435
To destroy a mesh
of feelings woven

1150
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:05,940
over 20 years is no joke,
I can assure you.

1151
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:18,319
Well...

1152
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:21,689
If three's a crowd,
then seven must be a bit

1153
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,324
of a challenge
for the pretty miss.

1154
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,229
<i>I must say I have a hard time</i>

1155
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:30,798
<i>picturing her</i>
<i>enjoying loneliness.</i>

1156
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:36,137
I think we'd better grab
the chance to get away,

1157
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:39,373
before things become grotesque.

1158
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,075
( Crying ) Come on.

1159
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,446
- No, dad!
- No. No. No.

1160
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,948
Come on. ( Grunts, huffs )

1161
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,185
You wouldn't want to give your father
a guilty conscience now, would you?

1162
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:53,954
( Screams )

1163
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:57,224
( Grunts )

1164
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,827
( Sobbing )

1165
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,565
( Screams )

1166
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,573
So how did this episode
affect your life?

1167
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,509
Not at all.

1168
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,047
- Not at all?
- No.

1169
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,351
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

1170
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,558
Oh, that's true.

1171
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,129
Some people...

1172
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,464
Blame the addict.

1173
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:41,268
<i>Other people feel sorry</i>
<i>for the addict.</i>

1174
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:45,472
But I was an addict out
of lust, not out of need.

1175
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,107
( Chuckles softly )

1176
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:48,909
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

1177
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:52,913
And lust that led
to destruction around me...

1178
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,882
Everywhere I went.

1179
01:20:56,451 --> 01:21:00,855
<i>Well, addiction</i>
<i>sometimes leads to an...</i>

1180
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,356
<i>Absence of empathy.</i>

1181
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,961
You can't fight a lion
and blow the noses

1182
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:09,063
of your children
at the same time.

1183
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:14,134
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

1184
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:17,938
<i>( Clicks tongue )</i>

1185
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,107
<i>You're very stubborn.</i>

1186
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:22,243
<i>But what about yourself?</i>

1187
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:25,346
<i>How did you feel</i>
<i>during all this?</i>

1188
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,291
Did you feel good

1189
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,093
or did you feel bad?

1190
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,503
Mrs. h was right
about the loneliness.

1191
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,006
I'd be lying if I said

1192
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,707
it hadn't been
my constant companion.

1193
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,280
<i>So you were with all these men</i>

1194
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:01,682
<i>and you still felt alone?</i>

1195
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,958
I didn't want
to tell you about it...

1196
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,695
<i>But you've led me into a trap.</i>

1197
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,601
It was a certain feeling.

1198
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,944
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

1199
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,356
<i>When I was seven,</i>
<i>I had to have an operation.</i>

1200
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:46,593
<i>Nothing serious,</i>
<i>but it did require anesthesia.</i>

1201
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,531
<i>I had already been</i>
<i>pre-medicated</i>

1202
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:53,267
<i>and was feeling all right.</i>

1203
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:57,071
<i>But when I looked into the room
where the doctors and nurses</i>

1204
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:58,739
<i>were preparing</i>
<i>for the operation...</i>

1205
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,643
<i>It was as if I had</i>
<i>to pass through</i>

1206
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:06,680
<i>an impenetrable gate</i>
<i>all by myself.</i>

1207
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,485
<i>It wasn't just that</i>
<i>I missed my mom.</i>

1208
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,921
<i>I don't think I missed my dad,</i>

1209
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:15,689
<i>even though</i>
<i>he was the nice one.</i>

1210
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,526
<i>It was as if I was</i>
<i>completely alone</i>

1211
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:21,095
<i>in the universe.</i>

1212
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:28,002
<i>As if my whole body was filled</i>
<i>with loneliness and tears.</i>

1213
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,661
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

1214
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,665
Shall we go on?

1215
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,708
<i>What are you reading?</i>

1216
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,544
I'm not reading really.
I'm just

1217
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,447
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan poe.

1218
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,716
I don't know him.

1219
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,685
No. Well, he was a...

1220
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,057
A very anxiety-ridden man.

1221
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,666
He died in the most fearful
way you can imagine,

1222
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:36,070
in something called
delirium tremens.

1223
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,542
It occurs when a long time
abuse of alcohol

1224
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:45,245
is followed by...
By a sudden abstinence.

1225
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:50,717
And your body goes into some
kind of a hypersensitive shock.

1226
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,355
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations

1227
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:59,193
<i>like rats and snakes</i>
<i>and cockroaches</i>

1228
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:03,530
<i>coming out of the floor and
worms slithering in the walls.</i>

1229
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,570
<i>One's entire nervous system</i>
<i>is on high alert</i>

1230
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:13,140
and you have a constant
panic and paranoia.

1231
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,611
And then
the circulatory system fails.

1232
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,214
But the panic and horror...

1233
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:24,118
Remains until
the moment of death.

1234
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,863
<i>( Rustles )</i>

1235
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,569

"When we are,
death has not come."

I know you like

It's extremely common to

from his little organ book.

<i>"Ich ruf zu dir,</i>
<i>herr jesu Christ."</i>

The theme is originally a hymn,

but bach rearranged it
and embellished it a little.

He was the master of polyphony,
if you know what that is.

No. Yet another thing
I don't know.

1381
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:19,412
<i>Well, polyphony is</i>

1382

<i>from the middle ages.</i>

1383
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:23,716
It's an entirely
European phenomenon.

1384
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:25,685
It's distinguished by...

1385
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,588
by the idea that every voice

1386

<i>is its own melody</i>

1387
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:34,160
but together in harmony.

1388
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:38,197
Bach's forerunner palestrina,

1389
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:41,234
he wrote many works
for several choirs

1390
01:40:41,236 --> 01:40:45,171
at the same time, wallowing in
polyphony. -<i>( Choir singing )</i>

1391
01:40:54,615 --> 01:40:57,417
But in my eyes, bach perfected

1392
01:40:57,419 --> 01:41:00,620
the melodic expression
and the harmony.

1393

<i>most likely based</i>
<i>on the fibonacci sequence.</i>

1396
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:15,168
You know, the one that
starts with a zero,

1397
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:17,303
then comes the one.

1398
01:41:17,305 --> 01:41:21,441
The sequence is created by
adding the two previous numbers

1399
01:41:21,443 --> 01:41:24,744
to create the new one, so
it's zero plus one makes one,

1400
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:27,513
and one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three,

1401
01:41:27,515 --> 01:41:30,650
and three plus two makes five,
and five plus three makes eight,

1402
01:41:30,652 --> 01:41:33,019
and eight plus five makes 13.

1403
01:41:33,021 --> 01:41:35,021
The sequence has
an interesting connection

1404

<i>The sum of the numeric values</i>
<i>represented in bach's name</i>

1411
01:41:55,677 --> 01:41:59,645
<i>is 14, a number he often
used in his compositions.</i>

1412
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:01,781
<i>The clever thing</i>
<i>about bach's name</i>

1413
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:05,051
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

1414

are all fibonacci numbers.

1415
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,592
This piece has three voices:

1416
01:42:12,594 --> 01:42:14,127
A bass voice...

1417
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:21,801
The second voice played
with the left hand...

1418
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,108
The first voice played
with the right hand.

1419
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:32,378
<i>That is called</i> cantus firmus
<i>or "can-toos feer-mus."</i>

1420
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:35,982
And together, these three
voices create the polyphony.

1421
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:43,489
Normally, a nymphomaniac
is seen as

1422
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:46,526
someone who can't get enough

1423
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:49,462
and therefore has sex
with many different people.

1424
01:42:49,464 --> 01:42:51,197
<i>Well, that of course is true,</i>

1425
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,366
<i>but if I'm to be honest,</i>

1426
01:42:53,368 --> 01:42:55,835
<i>I see it precisely as...</i>

1427
01:42:55,837 --> 01:43:00,806
The sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

1428
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:06,779
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

1429
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:13,819
<i>Since the music</i>
<i>has three voices,</i>

1430

<i>to talking about three lovers.</i>

<i>The bass is easy: That's f.</i>

1432

<i>F had a red car</i>
<i>that he'd bought used.</i>

<i>As I was having sex</i>

1434

<i>with seven or eight men</i>
<i>every night at the time,</i>

1435
01:43:33,608 --> 01:43:36,142
<i>scheduling was tricky</i>

1436
01:43:36,144 --> 01:43:39,512
<i>and they all had to have</i>
<i>precise appointments.</i>

1437

<i>F was a good man.</i>

1438
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:45,151
<i>If he was scheduled for 10:00,</i>

1439
01:43:45,153 --> 01:43:47,320
<i>he always showed up around 9:00</i>

1440
01:43:47,322 --> 01:43:49,622
<i>and parked down in the street.</i>

1441
01:43:49,624 --> 01:43:52,225
<i>I always smiled when I saw him.</i>

1442
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:55,494
<i>Often I took pity on him</i>

1443
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:57,230
<i>and gave him a cup of coffee</i>

1444

<i>while I was finishing</i>
<i>with the one before.</i>

1445
01:44:02,502 --> 01:44:05,538
<i>It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about f,</i>

1446
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:07,807
<i>but he was reassuring,</i>

1447
01:44:07,809 --> 01:44:11,677
<i>and he knew exactly what</i>
<i>I wanted when we had sex.</i>

1448
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,181
<i>No, I'd go even further and say</i>

1449
