ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

795

WELL, NOW THAT
YOU'VE FROZEN MY

I NEVER MEANT
FOR ARCHER TO BE
USED LIKE THAT.

800
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,021
AND HOW EXACTLY DID
YOU MEAN FOR IT
TO BE USED

801
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,898
AFTER YOU STOLE IT
FROM SMOAK TECH

802
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,650
AND SOLD IT
TO GALAXY ONE?

803
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,444
IT STARTED
AS A SOFTWARE

TURNED IT INTO
A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

805
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,074
ONCE HE HAD ARCHER,
HE THREATENED TO
USE IT TO HUNT

AND KILL EVERYONE
I LOVED UNLESS
I DISAPPEARED,
