- Thank you.

19
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:58,155
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

20
00:00:58,196 --> 00:00:59,906
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

21
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:01,548
Okay. Just let me shake
a few more hands,

22
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,618
and then we'll be
out of here... whoa.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,413
Easy, tiger.
I want you on your "A" game.

24
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:08,415
- "A" game?
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,916
You know,
I like the sound of that.

26
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,168
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,753
Merry Christmas.

00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:15,756
Becca.

29
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:20,177
New senior director,
digital marketing.

30
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,138
- Uh, yeah. How did you know?
- I have my sources.

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,932
And your nametag.

32
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:28,477
Yes, that, too.

33
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:31,146
- Uh, this is my husband, Billy.
- Great to meet you.

34
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:32,481
Billy Butcher.

35
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:35,650
Becca, you handled
my takeover, right?

36
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,486
Y-Yes, I-I did.

37
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,279
- You saw it?
- I loved it.

38
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:41,573
- U-Uh, wow. Thank you.
- No, thank you.

39
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,426
What'd you take over?
Vought's Twitter account.

40
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,410
- Yeah.
- Your brilliant wife here

41
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,912
did all the work.

42
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:49,164
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

43
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,707
It was exceptional.

44
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:53,376
All right, so they thought
it was you up there,

45
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,087
but it was really Becca.

46
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:56,463
Bit deceptive, isn't it?

47
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,090
Uh, no, Billy, that's what we do

48
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,925
'cause Homelander's busy
saving lives.

49
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,968
It's okay, it's okay.
I-It... you're right.

50
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,637
It's a little dishonest,

51
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:06,348
but I'm all thumbs when
it comes to that kind of stuff,

52
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,141
so leave it to the experts.

53
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,727
Listen, I would
love to talk to you

54
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,313
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

55
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,357
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

56
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:16,942
My dad, he always said,

57
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:20,821
"Surround yourself with people
smarter than you."

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,616
Oh, my, uh, better half is, uh,

59
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:27,119
wanting my attention, but maybe
we could chat tomorrow.

60
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,429
That sounds wonderful.
Thank you.

61
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,789
Thank you.
Greet to meet you, pal.

62
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,499
Good to meet you.

63
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,918
Love that accent.

64
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,673
Hello, beautiful.

65
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:41,258
How the fuck does he walk around

66
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,260
in that sweaty fucking wetsuit
all day long,

67
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,679
- balls mashed up against his leg like pancakes?
- Oh, shh.

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,347
- What?
- You promised to behave.

69
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,432
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah?

70
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:50,684
Yeah.

71
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:04,156
Hi.

72
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,849
- Huh.
- Hmm.

73
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:16,228
I didn't realize you were
such a cigar aficionado.

74
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,481
I really, I just...

75
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:23,652
Mm. I can't get enough
of huge gross logs

76
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,820
of filterless tobacco.

77
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:40,210
- This is all really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:45,340
But...

79
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,842
There is a "but" coming.

80
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,469
Okay.

81
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:53,848
But why did you bring me
to a hotel?

82
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,434
Hmm? And not your place?

83
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:59,729
Well, you know.
I mean, yeah, sure, my Dad

84
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:03,275
could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

85
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:07,320
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

86
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,532
Yeah, all right.

87
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,742
Yeah.

88
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,745
Yeah, very convincing.

89
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:18,039
You okay? What's going on?

90
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,960
It's just...

91
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,423
I've never seen your place,
or your job.

92
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:29,050
You're kind of a mystery to me.

93
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,885
T-That's hot, right?

94
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:34,889
Look, you got to understand
that my dad

95
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,519
was nothing but corny jokes
and expensive gifts,

96
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:44,441
until he was gone, and all
the money along with him.

97
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:48,486
I know that
that's not you, but...

98
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,326
I need to know that the hotel
is a nice thing

99
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,995
and not a red flag thing.

100
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,501
I quit my job.

101
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,672
Um, I'm sorry, I-I...

102
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,467
I really should've told you.

103
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:16,598
After Robin, programming
other people's remotes,

104
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,601
it felt kind of pointless.

105
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,898
And yeah, I mean,
you can-you can meet my dad,

106
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:27,359
but you're gonna
regret asking that.

107
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,157
So everything's okay?

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,579
It's great.

109
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:43,958
No red flags.

110
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,796
Hmm.

111
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,696
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

112
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:58,366
but to have a hero like you in
a place like Sandusky, I mean,

113
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:02,036
everyone down at the local
branch is just tickled pink.

114
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:04,914
- Yeah.
- Now, we got Cedar Point,

115
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,543
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

116
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,963
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

117
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,675
And Lake Erie? Right here,

118
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:17,719
- if you want to swim.
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,596
Ooh. Uh...

120
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,097
There it is.

121
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,807
- What's this?
- That's your per diem.

122
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,642
You get $75 a day.

123
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,728
Grocery store,
right down the street.

124
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,355
To make my own food?

125
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:30,857
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

126
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,066
Like Blizzards and stuff?

127
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,485
You betcha.

128
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:35,069
Well...

129
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,363
I mean, what about
my crime itinerary?

130
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:39,741
I think the best thing's just
to, you know, get out there

131
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,051
and put some points
on the board.

132
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,660
Not much crime in Sandusky.

133
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,579
I mean, we're not a shithole
like Akron.

134
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,834
But if something comes up,
we'll call.

135
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,586
You'll call?

136
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:54,714
- Absolutely.

00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:43,012
I can't do this shit, man.

That Compound V shit
is killing you.

154
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,209
Hey. Don't even say it out loud,
all right?

155
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:56,544
You don't know shit about it,
you understand?

156
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,570
I don't want to know.

157
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,739
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

158
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:03,783
Did you see my last time
out there?

159
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:06,661
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

160
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:09,205
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

161
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:10,873
Okay? None of that shit.
We train.

162
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:12,292
Back to the basics.

163
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,211
Nobody gets it back at my age.

164
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,756
I'm gonna be a freak show
like Ben Johnson,

165
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,633
racing against horses.

166
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:23,845
At least you'll still
be breathing.

167
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,475
Shit.

168
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,729
- I got to go.
- Where?

169
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,656
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

170
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:47,160
Just wanted to see
your smiling faces.

171
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,912
Take a seat, buddy.

172
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:57,253
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

173
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,839
a little heart-to-heart.

174
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,092
A rap session,
maybe a little tough love.

175
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:05,386
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,975
It means that lately,
some of you

177
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,854
have been, eh,
a little out of sorts.

178
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,232
Erratic.

179
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:20,318
Unreliable.

180
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,280
Downright sloppy.

181
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,282
Not you, Noir.
You've been great.

182
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,826
But the rest of you...

183
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,167
It is fair to say
that I am disappointed.

184
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,337
Got to keep your eye
on the ball, guys.

185
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,673
The enemies
are storming the gates.

186
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:45,927
I mean, we're not even The Seven
anymore, we're down to five.

187
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:48,429
We're dropping
like fucking flies,

188
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,808
but at least now I know why.

189
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,979
Uh...

190
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:00,191
Why...

191
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,318
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

192
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,945
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

193
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,406
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

194
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,742
He and Starlight
are going steady.

195
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:13,996
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

196
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:15,748
Wait, what?

197
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,250
As well as blackmailing.

198
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,212
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

199
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,922
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

200
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:26,342
No. No, no, no.
You... That-that is insane.

201
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:29,929
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

202
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:32,473
- but words...
- No, sir.

203
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:35,852
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

204
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,770
It's just, he's not...

205
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,732
I mean, why would he do that?

206
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:43,443
Good question.
A-Train, over to you.

207
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:46,446
- What?
- Oh, boy.

208
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:50,324
That little egg of yours
is still scrambled, huh?

209
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,870
How about now?

210
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:56,748
Oh, shit.

211
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,750
I know this guy.

212
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,376
You did smash through
his girlfriend,

213
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,794
so I should hope so.

214
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:05,047
Robin s-something or other.

215
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:10,011
I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

216
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:13,264
He was all in my face.

217
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:16,392
- You're fucking this guy?
- S... Okay, slow down.

218
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,269
I don't know what's going on,

219
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:22,190
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

220
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,859
Well, that is true, actually.
That's very true.

221
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,986
He is just a man, and,

222
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,113
by the looks of it,
not much of one.

223
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:31,324
But... but hear me out.

224
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:35,453
W-What if he was helped? Hmm?

225
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,206
Say someone,

226
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:39,832
I don't know,

227
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,918
got him in to see Ezekiel

228
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,712
and got rid of the Deep.

229
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,048
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

230
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,802
Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

231
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,848
Sit down.

232
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,234
Now... I know

233
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,903
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

234
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,822
an "All the single ladies"
moment.

235
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,615
Power, right?

236
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:15,451
But really, what you've done

237
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,496
is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

238
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:22,208
I mean, The Seven
is down by two.

239
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,961
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

240
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,964
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

241
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,800
which one of us is next, hmm?

242
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,343
You bitch.

243
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,513
- I didn't do anything.
- Enough!

244
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,099
We're a different fucking breed.

245
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,725
We shine with the golden light

246
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:43,563
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

247
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,981
fucking mud people

248
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,234
- to go against us.
- No.

249
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:51,487
Shut your fucking mouth,
young lady.

250
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,700
If you were in my position...

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,746
what would you do to you?

252
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,250
Homelander, that's enough.

253
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,294
You got something to add, Maeve?

254
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,590
She didn't know.

255
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,426
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

256
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,345
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

257
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:18,598
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

258
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,851
She obviously fell
for this Hugh Campbell guy

259
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:23,978
and he's pumping her
for information,

260
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,522
so back off, leave her alone.

261
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,614
Wow.

262
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,782
Starlight,

263
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,035
you must be something special.

264
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,870
Hmm?

265
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:44,498
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit ab...

266
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,125
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

267
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,169
really.

268
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,972
And if I say no?

269
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:04,936
Come on.

270
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,063
I got this.

271
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:09,815
It's you and me,

272
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,151
remember?

273
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,117
Don't say
I never do anything for you.

274
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:25,873
All right.

275
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,876
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

276
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,253
I just hope
you're right about her,

277
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,297
for both your sakes.

278
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,425
Class dismissed.

279
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,690
Look at this.

280
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:52,775
Oh, no. You don't stir,

281
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,735
you fold. Like this.

282
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,490
Now that's what
makes them spongy.

283
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,826
Here you go.

284
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,751
She wants to know
where you were.

285
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,921
That's a compelling
fucking question.

286
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,967
Hey, can we talk?

287
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,385
That's what we're doing, innit?

288
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,178
No, I mean...

289
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,223
There ain't no secrets here,
son. Spit it out.

290
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,684
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

291
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,519
Hughie doesn't mind.
Do you, Hughie?

292
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:36,152
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

293
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:41,157
- Do what?
- This.

294
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,617
I mean, Vought,
whatever with Kimiko,

295
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:45,995
it's-it's awful,
and you got to stop it,

296
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,456
- but I can't.
- Right.

297
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,083
You just want to kick back,
drink a few Mai Tais,

298
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,127
and let us do all the work,
is that it?

299
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,795
You know, I managed to go
my whole life

300
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,231
without seeing someone
die horribly,

301
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,923
and now I'm up to about
a half dozen,

302
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,341
- so I think I'm good.
- Please.

303
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,677
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

304
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,472
just like the rest of us.

305
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,766
Now, why don't you
stop pissing around

306
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,643
and tell everybody what this
is really all about?

307
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:12,063
- Yeah?
- Fine.

308
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,731
Annie.

309
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:14,899
- Fuck.
- Okay?

310
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,817
It's about Annie.

311
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,113
Fucking finally.

312
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:26,243
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

313
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,472
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

314
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:31,165
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

315
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,350
- All right? We'll just...
- Just what?

316
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,418
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

317
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,878
Maybe pump out a few
flying babies?

318
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,671
No. I... I don't know.

319
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,840
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

320
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,468
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

321
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,596
That bitch is fucking
playing you,

322
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,264
and you're too fucking blind
to see it.

323
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,308
Right, so better to be loyal
to a dead woman

324
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,726
who doesn't know
and doesn't care?

325
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,770
How's that working out for you?

326
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,042
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Hughie.

327
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,002
Long time no talk.

328
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,064
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

329
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,339
Who's this?

330
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,966
I thought you would
recognize my voice.

331
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,135
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

332
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:28,055
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

333
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,200
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

334
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,433
Dad, are you okay?

335
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,270
Oh, o-okay.

336
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,814
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

337
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,774
A-Train, listen to me.

338
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,902
Oh, shit, if he's burned,
then I'm fucked.

339
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,320
He's on fucking Medicaid.

340
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:44,655
He's harmless. Let him go.

341
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,782
My place is burned.
They've got me.

342
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,118
Oh, my God.

343
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,162
Get your ass over here
in 20 minutes,

344
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,372
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

345
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,916
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

346
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,293
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

347
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,795
alone. If I catch a whiff,

348
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,255
a whiff of one of your

349
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:03,090
- little asshole friends...
- I got it.

350
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,428
All my bank accounts are frozen
and flagged. Monique,

351
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,054
listen, when you get this,

352
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:12,433
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

353
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:14,578
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie.

354
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,079
- She doesn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

355
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,439
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

356
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,774
Hey, hold on a second.
She doesn't know. It wasn't her.

357
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,193
She's never seen me before.

358
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,321
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

359
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,285
Mesmer. You fucking idiots

360
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,953
had to go to Mesmer.

361
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,622
Fuck me.

362
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,877
Thank you.

363
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,588
That was not smart,
to sleep with her.

364
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,767
- Hughie.
- Dad.

365
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,520
He's acting strange.

366
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,022
You know, real jumpy.

367
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:02,650
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

368
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:05,402
Right here, sport.

369
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,280
Look what I got.

370
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:13,244
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

371
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,246
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

372
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,748
Watch out, A-Train's coming.

373
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,209
You were a fan!

374
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,920
You were a fan, and not,
like, a dabbler, no,

375
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,130
you were super fan 99.

376
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,340
Excuse me, sir.

377
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,943
- W-What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

378
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,469
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

379
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:33,013
I came alone.

380
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,224
You let him go.

381
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,269
Alone, huh?

382
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,187
- Wow.
- Ah!

383
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:41,897
You really did come alone.

384
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,292
Next time... there's not gonna be
a next time, but next time...

385
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:47,861
Have at least
a few cards up your sleeve.

386
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:51,740
Okay. You mean, um,
you mean, like this?

387
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,413
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- W-What is that?

388
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,373
I don't know what that shit is.

389
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,041
Oh, you don't?

390
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,836
So you don't mind if I do this.

391
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,837
- No, fuck!
- What?

392
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:06,213
What the fuck is wrong with you?

393
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,381
I have a bigger dose.

394
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,984
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

395
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,551
Let him go, I hand it over,

396
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,928
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

397
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,681
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

398
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:17,891
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

399
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,694
If you try anything,

400
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:31,405
I can catch up to dear old daddy
in a millisecond.

401
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,282
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

402
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,658
I'll be right behind you.

403
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,300
I am not leaving you
with him, all right.

404
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:37,745
You're just a kid.
You're my kid.

405
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,039
Dad.

406
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,458
I'll be all right.

407
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,418
I got this.

408
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:49,214
Go.

409
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:57,348
All right, where is it?

410
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:01,518
You know, this shit
must be pretty good

411
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,146
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

412
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,398
Oh, my God, man,
that was an accident.

413
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,193
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

414
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,611
And what about Popclaw?

415
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:13,322
She had a name, too.

416
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:16,450
Charlotte!

417
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:20,079
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

418
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,623
What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

419
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,041
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

420
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,709
You used her.

421
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,628
You put her in danger,

422
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,506
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

423
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,802
How does this not all start
with you, Hughie?

424
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:36,720
The only difference
between you and me

425
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,180
is that I made a mistake.

426
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:40,307
The shit that you did
was on purpose.

427
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,352
So who's worse?

428
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,606
You bitch!

429
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:49,108
You know, you're right.

430
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,901
It would've been stupid
to come alone.

431
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:58,033
Monique,
it's not safe here anymore.

432
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,284
We got to go.

433
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:02,830
You swore to me
and to Jesus Christ

434
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,623
that you were done
with Billy Butcher.

435
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,417
I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

436
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,627
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- No, I ain't blaming him.

437
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,421
Last I checked,
you're a grown-ass man.

438
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:14,258
It's my fault, okay?

439
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,468
But we can't do this right now.

440
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,905
- You put us in danger without thinking twice, Marvin.
- Monique, just...

441
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:21,306
Daddy!

442
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:23,851
Hey, baby, come here.
Give me a hug. Oh.

443
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,938
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

444
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,982
You were? Can I see?

445
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:33,026
Oh, my goodness,
this is beautiful.

446
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,820
Thank you, baby.

447
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,322
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

448
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:40,075
Can you help Mommy
pack your toys?

449
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,910
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

450
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:44,496
We don't have time to pack toys.

451
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:46,331
We got to go.

452
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:49,751
I knew you'd vote
your conscience, Senator.

453
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:52,004
Thank you.

454
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:54,047
Good-bye.

455
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:58,010
Three votes to go.

456
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,431
And the B.A. guys

457
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:04,725
said that the Pentagon
is shelling out

458
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:07,060
$35 billion on the low end.

459
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:11,231
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

460
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:15,235
That's incredible.
Edgar must be thrilled.

461
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:18,113
Ugh, fuck Edgar.

462
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:22,075
We did this, you and me.
This is about us.

463
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:27,206
Hey, do you remember
that marketing girl?

464
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:29,541
Ashley?

465
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,418
Um, I'm sorry,
I-I had to fire her, she...

466
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,131
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

467
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:37,132
Becca.

468
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:39,218
Becca?

469
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:41,011
- Yes.
- Becca Butcher.

470
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:42,179
That's it.

471
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:45,307
Mm-hmm. Yeah, her.

472
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,894
What about her?

473
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:51,396
Well, she's missing.

474
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:53,607
What do you mean, missing?

475
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:56,318
I mean missing, as in missing,

476
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,028
presumed dead.

477
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,780
- Wow.
- Yeah.

478
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:02,658
I looked at her file, and
the cops think it was suicide.

479
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:03,825
Mm.

480
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,203
Yeah, it seems her husband...

481
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,039
Well, he got pretty riled up.

482
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,083
William Butcher.

483
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:16,338
Am I supposed to know his name?

484
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,175
No. Not specifically, but...

485
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:24,429
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

486
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,682
No, I just assumed
that she quit.

487
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:28,225
Quit?

488
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:31,937
Is there any particular reason

489
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,439
why you are asking
all of these questions?

490
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,234
No, no. I'm just... curious.

491
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:40,195
It's interesting, right?
I mean, it's...

492
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:43,115
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

493
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,242
Yeah. Yes, very.

494
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,788
You know, I was, I was
thinking that maybe, um,

495
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,959
I could get Maria to stay late
with the baby and...

496
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,507
maybe we could order in and...

497
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,760
catch up. Just me and you.

498
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:09,016
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

499
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:13,186
But you go be a mommy.

500
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:27,326
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it here.

501
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,994
You like roller coasters?

502
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:31,038
I'm more of a water park guy.

503
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,165
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

504
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:35,208
Mm-hmm.

505
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:46,428
You first.

506
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,847
Huh...?

507
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:52,142
Oh. Well, most girls
like the suit.

508
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:55,604
Well, I'm not most girls.

509
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:59,107
Mm. Is it true what they say?

510
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,109
Come on, baby.

511
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,695
I got you here in the flesh.

512
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,113
I got to see it.

513
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:07,449
Please?

514
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:12,037
I don't, I don't look
like everyone else.

515
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,498
That's what I'm counting on.

516
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,128
All right.

517
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,556
Oh, look at those gills.

518
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:35,894
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

519
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:39,940
Hey, can-can...
Can we just, uh...

520
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,234
Ah... be gentle, be gentle.

521
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,403
Ow, it's tender. Oh, God.

522
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:48,949
Okay. That hurts.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

523
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,344
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

524
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:53,954
No, I said it hurt.

525
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,418
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

526
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:02,170
I'm not going anywhere,

527
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:03,672
you little fucking freak.

528
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:07,843
Lay back.

529
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,845
I said, lay back.

530
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:11,805
Ah. God. Ow!

531
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,933
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

532
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,560
- Oh, yeah. You like that?
- Ow.

533
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,813
Oh, you little fucking freak.

534
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:22,441
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

535
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:25,110
Ow. Oh, God.

536
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,447
Ow, ow. Oh, God.

537
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,886
Having a good growler, are we?

538
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:38,058
How did you...?

539
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,812
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

540
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:44,815
'Cause, you know, fuck you.

541
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:46,191
No...

542
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,609
What did you expect me to do?

543
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:49,236
It was Homelander.

544
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,573
You got to talk to me.

545
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:59,454
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

546
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,791
Becca?

547
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:11,591
Your wife.

548
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,593
'Cause she's missing?

549
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:15,846
I can help you find her.

550
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,167
Please, I have a daughter!

551
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:47,794
No!

552
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:12,068
Don't want none, fuck off.

553
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,112
I'm here about your wife.

554
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:17,741
I believe this was a few days

555
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:22,078
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

556
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,674
She was alone with him
for three hours.

557
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:54,069
Not long after that,
Rebecca went missing

558
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,279
and has remained so ever since.

559
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,490
One way or another, Mr. Butcher,

560
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:00,575
I believe Homelander
was involved.

561
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:02,994
Homelander?

562
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,082
But he's a fucking superhero.

563
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,086
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

564
00:33:15,882 --> 00:33:17,884
Who the fuck are you?

565
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,764
My name is Mallory.

566
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:26,851
I'm the person
who can get you payback.

567
00:33:39,823 --> 00:33:43,618
Who's calling?

568
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,371
Nobody.

569
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:55,088
Listen, if you...

570
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,843
if you want to talk,
I suppose we...

571
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:01,886
No.

572
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,725
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

573
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:16,276
You know, I had someone once.

574
00:34:16,317 --> 00:34:20,155
We were gonna get away,
start a family.

575
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:23,199
So what happened?

576
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,038
Well...

577
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,291
Everyone always asks,

578
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:34,919
what's our special weakness?

579
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,337
Gamma rays?

580
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:38,798
Iron daggers?

581
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,385
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

582
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:46,014
The truth is,

583
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:50,560
our weakness
is the same as anyone's.

584
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,604
It's people.

585
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:56,649
The people we care about.

586
00:34:56,691 --> 00:35:00,653
So I say, cut them loose.

587
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:03,865
For your good and for theirs.

588
00:35:03,907 --> 00:35:07,368
That way
you're really bulletproof.

589
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,935
What's up, man?

590
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:35,230
How'd you end up here?

591
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,440
Oh, tell me about it.

592
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,901
Me, too.

593
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,030
What's that?

594
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:46,074
Oh.

595
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:49,285
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

596
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:51,746
It's really not
that big of a deal.

597
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,957
I'm gonna get you out of here.

598
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:56,209
Just hang tight.

599
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,632
Excuse me, sir.

600
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,552
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

601
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:07,804
- You got it.
- Thanks.

602
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:16,020
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no.
Not that one.

603
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,063
This one.

604
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,523
Yeah, that's my guy.

605
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,367
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

606
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:33,121
Larry, please.

607
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,582
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

608
00:36:35,623 --> 00:36:37,500
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

609
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,544
Putain!

610
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:45,133
Hi, you've reached Annie.

611
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:46,935
- I can't come to the phone...
- Oh, damn it.

612
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:51,806
That's Hughie, baby.

613
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:54,976
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

614
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:57,270
She's good-looking, man.

615
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,397
Right, baby?

616
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,330
Mr. Campbell.

617
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:16,873
Ooh, yeah.

618
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:19,626
Pleasure to meet you.
Billy Butcher.

619
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,128
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

620
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,006
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

621
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:27,050
He's all mine.

622
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,303
Hello, hello, hello.

623
00:37:30,345 --> 00:37:33,640
What have we got here, then, eh?

624
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:35,433
What's your name, sweetheart?

625
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,268
You can call me Uncle Billy.

626
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,312
He ain't your uncle, honey.

627
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:44,525
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

628
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,154
Good to see you.

629
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,498
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come

630
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,541
to the phone right now...

631
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:06,547
What's she doing?

632
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,260
Uh, okay. It's okay.

633
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,262
It's okay.

634
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:15,115
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

635
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,683
Uh, Asian.

636
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:17,892
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

637
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,936
And no, I don't think she does.

638
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,856
Dad, I'm really sorry.

639
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,900
I'm sorry about everything.

640
00:38:25,942 --> 00:38:28,653
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

641
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:32,115
Look at you,
standing up for yourself.

642
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,658
Jings.

643
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,667
Cold feet, huh?

644
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:44,085
What?

645
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,503
You said Raynor got cold feet.

646
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,171
Yeah, that's what I said.

647
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,716
You know what I think it is?

648
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:52,010
I think
Raynor's plenty interested,

649
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:55,596
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

650
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,807
and you blew
the whole fucking thing up.

651
00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,309
How am I doing so far?

652
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,477
No, mate. Way off.

653
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,105
Bullshit, Butcher.

654
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:07,233
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

655
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,569
you're not gonna let anything
get in your way,

656
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,488
even if it's
your own fucking friends, man.

657
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,991
You promised me
things would be different.

658
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,035
Matter of fact, you swore it.

659
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:20,038
But this is worse, man.

660
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,457
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over again,

661
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:24,751
only this time
it's gonna be my family.

662
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,170
And if something happens
to them, Butcher...

663
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:37,847
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

664
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,308
or how that situation
got fucked up,

665
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,685
but just please call her.

666
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:44,896
Please.

667
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:56,908
Yeah.

668
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:59,077
There you go.

669
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,456
Dr. Vogelbaum.

670
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,172
Surprise.

671
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:13,633
Thought I'd drop in on you.

672
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,594
You look well.

673
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:18,638
How long's it been, John?

674
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:22,558
Long enough that
no one calls me John anymore.

675
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,685
Mm.

676
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:30,149
So, what are these? Uh... pets?

677
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:32,151
No, just breeding them.

678
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:33,861
German retrievers.

679
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:37,490
I try not to get
too attached to my subjects.

680
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:40,827
Hmm. Well, that's true.

681
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:45,331
Seems retirement suits you.

682
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,253
Between this
and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

683
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,880
I'll take the lab. No contest.

684
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:57,552
So, you ever, uh...

685
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,887
catch up with any
of the old gang from Vought?

686
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,141
Look, do you mind
if we don't do this?

687
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:06,144
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

688
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:08,438
You want to know
about Rebecca Butcher.

689
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:10,290
You went to Stillwell
about it because you knew

690
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,400
that'd tip over
the first domino.

691
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:14,110
Well, it led to me.

692
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,698
So just ask.

693
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,533
I'll be honest.

694
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:26,080
Well, that would be a first.

695
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,043
Eight years ago...

696
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:34,172
Stillwell called me with quite
an interesting challenge.

697
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:38,968
Rebecca Butcher
had come to her with a...

698
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,929
completely unprecedented
medical condition.

699
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:44,932
What condition?

700
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,606
She was pregnant.

701
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:53,691
With your child.

702
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:58,905
Pregnant?

703
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,742
Wh...

704
00:42:04,577 --> 00:42:08,039
But I thought I couldn't.

705
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,957
So did I.

706
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:12,043
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

707
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:16,005
The fetus was developing
unnaturally fast.

708
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,216
We told her we'd deliver
the baby safely

709
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:19,759
at a secure location,

710
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,385
but she had to sign an NDA.

711
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:22,929
Couldn't tell anyone.

712
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:26,349
Not even her husband.

713
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,101
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

714
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:32,813
No!

715
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:35,566
No! Pull it out... Oh, my...

716
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,117
The birth was difficult.

717
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,788
The baby clawed its way
out of her.

718
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:53,167
The blood loss...
no one could have survived.

719
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,045
She died on the table.

720
00:42:57,838 --> 00:42:59,298
A-And the baby?

721
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,342
Lived all of ten seconds.

722
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:04,262
Drowned in its mother's blood.

723
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,642
Was it a boy?

724
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:12,270
Does it matter?

725
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:15,314
Why didn't you tell me?

726
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:17,316
To protect you.

727
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,778
That's always job one
at Vought, isn't it?

728
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,614
Protect our
most profitable asset?

729
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:27,952
So why are you telling me now?

730
00:43:27,994 --> 00:43:29,996
You don't understand.

731
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,001
The thing about
cross-breeding dogs,

732
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,003
you get the right genes,

733
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:38,838
you can get a perfect creation.

734
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,382
But it doesn't matter
how perfect they are.

735
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:44,677
It's not enough.

736
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:46,721
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

737
00:43:46,762 --> 00:43:48,139
they become violent.

738
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,850
Aggressive.

739
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,893
Downright hateful.

740
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,315
You should have been raised

741
00:43:57,356 --> 00:43:59,358
in a home with a family
who loved you.

742
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,029
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

743
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,573
And yet, I turned out great.

744
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:08,284
When I think
what it's done to you,

745
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:11,829
and what you can now do
to everyone else...

746
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:19,795
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:22,923
I don't want
your fucking apology.

748
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:24,884
All this is my fault.

749
00:44:24,925 --> 00:44:27,637
What do you want?

750
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:30,139
What?

751
00:44:31,932 --> 00:44:34,310
What do you want... forgiveness?

752
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,354
Now?

753
00:44:38,481 --> 00:44:41,150
After you raised me
like a fucking lab rat?

754
00:44:45,237 --> 00:44:47,239
No.

755
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:51,243
Too little, too late.

756
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,581
I don't want anything
from you, John.

757
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:59,877
I'm just an old man,
thinking about his mistakes.

758
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:07,885
I'm the world's greatest
superhero.

759
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:11,889
You're my greatest failure.

760
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:22,149
Hi. You've reached Annie.

761
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:24,151
I can't come
to the phone right now, but...

762
00:45:29,782 --> 00:45:31,867
Merde!

763
00:45:34,036 --> 00:45:35,413
Butcher.

764
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:37,248
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell.

765
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:38,916
Calm down.

766
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,502
Okay, come on.

767
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,971
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

768
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:55,266
M.M.

769
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:57,184
Deputy Director.

770
00:45:57,226 --> 00:45:59,061
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

771
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:00,604
Thank you.

772
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:07,194
You called?

773
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:08,779
You are a human after all.

774
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:11,198
Well, let's not get
too carried away.

775
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,616
Thanks, man.

776
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:14,660
Come right this way, ma'am.

777
00:46:19,707 --> 00:46:21,667
Monique, I'm sorry.

778
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:23,794
I never want to see you again,
Marvin.

779
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,048
Come here, baby.

780
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,217
Mmm.

781
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:32,094
Daddy loves you, okay?

782
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,138
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

783
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,182
All right? All right.

784
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:47,443
Take care of yourself.

785
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:49,487
All right. All right.

786
00:46:58,078 --> 00:47:00,039
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

787
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,541
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

788
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,752
Do you want this or not?

789
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:37,451
Annie, are you okay?

790
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,872
I have to see you.

791
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,167
I, uh...

792
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,294
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

793
00:47:47,336 --> 00:47:49,088
You have to explain, Hughie.

794
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:51,090
You have
to make this make sense.

795
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:52,967
Just you and me.

796
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,512
You owe me that much.

797
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:01,016
I'm sorry.

798
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:02,935
I'm afraid I'm not following.

799
00:48:02,977 --> 00:48:05,813
You and your corporation
are fucked.

800
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:10,109
Unequivocally,
unilaterally fucked.

801
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,945
How was that?
Is that clearer for you?

802
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:17,992
For the last half century,

803
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:21,203
you have been feeding
the American people the line

804
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:24,498
that your superheroes
are chosen by God.

805
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,756
I mean, I get it.

806
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:34,550
Jamming illegal drugs
into babies' arms...

807
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:37,052
I mean, that doesn't quite
have the same ring,

808
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:38,971
and that's not even the worst.

809
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:42,766
What did you do
to this one, and why?

810
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:45,477
I've never seen her
in my entire life.

811
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,146
Uh-huh.

812
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:49,356
- What do you want?
- For starters,

813
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:52,234
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

814
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,361
The bill's already gone down
to the floor.

815
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:56,572
They're gonna vote on it
any day now.

816
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:58,157
And you're pulling it.

817
00:48:58,198 --> 00:49:00,743
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

818
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:02,953
I don't give a shit,
but the deal is dead.

819
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:05,372
And we're gonna go
back to status quo,

820
00:49:05,414 --> 00:49:07,374
where we're the government
and the military,

821
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,920
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

822
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:13,464
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

823
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:15,299
Corruption story of the century.

824
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:16,759
Vought shares go to zero.

825
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,178
The civil suits,
criminal prosecution,

826
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,138
and you go bankrupt,
and your cute

827
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,726
little suit goes to a lovely
shade of orange for 15 to 30.

828
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:28,854
Ms. Raynor?

829
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,982
Thank you, Michaela.

830
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:38,238
We're done here.

831
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,950
Everything okay, I hope?

832
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:47,539
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

833
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:49,959
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

834
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,669
about 15 miles
outside of Damascus.

835
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,172
Right, as planned.
So what's the problem?

836
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:56,882
Watch.

837
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:01,428
We got two.

838
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,431
- Nice eye.
- Stop.

839
00:50:04,473 --> 00:50:07,226
That's our guy. Light him up.

840
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:08,936
Great.

841
00:50:08,978 --> 00:50:11,855
The prick behind Flight 37
is dead. What am I missing?

842
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:14,191
Just wait.

843
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:19,655
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

844
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,953
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

845
00:50:25,995 --> 00:50:27,454
- Hey!
- Get down!

846
00:50:27,496 --> 00:50:29,415
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

847
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:31,834
I said get down!

848
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,335
What the fuck does that say?

849
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:35,462
"Naqib."

850
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:37,297
Hey!

851
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:39,091
Freeze, motherfucker!

852
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,385
Kill him!

853
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:57,276
That's not all.

854
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:12,249
How is that son of a bitch
still alive?

855
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:16,712
"Naqib" means "Captain."

856
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:18,630
We believe it's his...

857
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:20,674
Supe name.

858
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:32,061
Are you telling me

859
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:35,189
they have a Supe terrorist?

860
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,419
Look, Annie, I-I...

861
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,379
Did you kill Translucent?

862
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:03,258
It's-it's...
it's not that simple.

863
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:07,638
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

864
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,486
Y...

865
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:24,071
You're a murderer.

866
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:25,948
We didn't have a choice.

867
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:28,325
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

868
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,035
Aah. What-what are you doing?

869
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:32,287
- I'm taking you in.
- What... No. Annie, hold on.

870
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:34,373
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

871
00:52:34,414 --> 00:52:35,934
- than The Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

872
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,918
Listen to me, okay?
I know this is so fucked.

873
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,212
You were the only thing, Hughie.

874
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:41,981
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

875
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,715
I'm still me, Annie.

876
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:46,135
Please. You know me.

877
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,137
I don't know you.

878
00:52:48,178 --> 00:52:50,848
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

879
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,558
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

880
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,394
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

881
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:57,396
Lots of press.
The guy who killed Translucent.

882
00:52:57,437 --> 00:52:59,356
This isn't about Translucent.

883
00:52:59,398 --> 00:53:01,608
Okay? This is about Compound V.

884
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:06,488
Compound V?

885
00:53:08,782 --> 00:53:10,951
It's this drug.

886
00:53:10,993 --> 00:53:13,704
It, um...

887
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:16,123
It gives the Supes their powers.

888
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:19,418
Vought will do anything
to cover it up.

889
00:53:19,459 --> 00:53:22,296
N... No. What? Wha...?

890
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:24,339
What are you talking about?

891
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,135
We're born like this.

892
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,889
I'm so sorry.

893
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:35,726
Annie. Annie.

894
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:37,352
Annie, watch out!

895
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:39,938
Fucking run, Hughie.

896
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:50,407
I'm so sorry.

897
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:52,826
Get the fuck away from her!

898
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:58,207
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

899
00:53:58,248 --> 00:53:59,791
I didn't ask for your help.

900
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,673
Yeah. Looked like
you had it all under control.
