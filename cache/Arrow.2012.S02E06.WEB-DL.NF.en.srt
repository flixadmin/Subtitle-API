Follow me. Move!

We're clear.

00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,873
Stop the truck.

Get out.

485
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,044
Get out.

486
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,050
Move, Lawton.

487

That's the thing about honor, John...

00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,414
I'm just curious.

491
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,625
How is it you think
your brother ended up dead?

492
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,714
You shot at a client that Andy was protecting
and you missed.

493
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,300
I don't miss.

494
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,012
Your brother was the contract.

495
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,806
Who would wanna kill Andy?

496
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,143
Don't know their names, just an alias.

H.I.V.E.

498
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:14,070
Food for thought, John.
Food for thought.

499
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,436
Are we going to discuss
what happened last night?

500
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,438
Why would we?

501
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,981
OLIVER:
No reason.

502
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,067
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

503
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,706
Thank you.

504
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,460
You had my back.

505
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,797
And now you know what it feels like.

506
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,516
What are you...? What are you doing here?

507
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,187
Good question. I've gotten a lot of calls from
prison, but never from my girlfriend's mother.

508
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:34,567
It occurred to me that I've never been given
the opportunity to meet the man in your life.

509
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,821
I don't know if she told you,
but your daughter kind of dumped me.

510
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,240
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

511
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,368
Jean told me she came to see you.

512
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,036
I told her she shouldn't have.

513
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,625
-Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
-Look, us being together...

514
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,377
...it can hurt her case.

515
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:58,717
Thea, your social life is not going to be
the determining factor in my trial.

516
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,720
Sweetheart, what you've had to endure
this last year...

517
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,223
...is more than most people go through
in two lifetimes.

518
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,393
But you've not only survived,
you've flourished.

519
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,396
I think a lot of that has to do with Roy.

520
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,275
So as your mother,
I forbid you not to see him.

MOIRA: Ha, ha.

523
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:28,413
I have to admit, this is not how I anticipated
my trip to Russia ending.

524
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,292
You just feel lucky
we made it out of there alive.

525
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,088
Thank you.
Not just for coming for me.

526
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,382
For doing what you had to once you did.

527
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,844
You mean working with Deadshot?

528
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,433
You know, me and Carly broke up
because I couldn't love her...

529
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,226
...and hate him at the same time.

530
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,354
I'm honored to be the exception.

531
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,608
Lyla, you were always the exception.

532
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,037
I have a debrief with A.R.G.U.S. at 0800.

533
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,790
No, no. Let Waller stew.

534

Stay for breakfast.

535

Throw in your blueberry pancakes
and you may be able to convince me.

Why her?

539
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,506
I mean, besides the obvious
leggy-model reason.

540
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,259
It just kind of happened.

541
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,178
It didn't mean anything.

Hey.

543
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,019
Because of the life that I lead...

544
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,983
...I just think that it's better to not...

545
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,528
...be with someone
that I could really care about.

546
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,835
Well, I think...

547
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,175
I think you deserve better than her.

She's right.

we'll need him to lead us to the graves.

who gives the orders here, you...

...or your little <i>bouzin.</i>
