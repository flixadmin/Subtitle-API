1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,557
Hi, my name is Michael Stuhlbarg.

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:19,811
I play Professor Perlman in this film
you're about to watch,

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,939
<i>Call Me by Your Name.</i>
And I'm here with...

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,108
Timothée Chalamet
and I play Elio Perlman.

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,364
Frenesy, that's Luca's
production company.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,580
I think both of us have seen the film
a number of times at this point.

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:45,295
And just seeing the credits come up,
honestly, it's...

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,839
There's so many people involved
in the making of this thing.

9
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,385
So many tax credits.
So many shortcuts made

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,720
to make about $3 work...

11
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,931
It looks so official to all the font

12
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,810
and all the little insignias.
And there's the music.

13
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,983
Now, this font that he uses
throughout this opening credit sequence,

14
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,488
I think Luca was walking in Milan
past a store front

15
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,782
that he liked the writing on.

16
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,453
And went inside and this person
had never

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,874
done font outside
of a window-front setting.

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,960
You're kidding. That's fantastic.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,923
It's funny, 'cause if you see
the Sony international posters

20
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,925
and everything they're doing
to market the film,

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,469
sometimes the title in another language
is different

22
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,430
and they've hired somebody
to imitate this font.

23
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,514
How funny.

24
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,266
But you can tell it's very slightly off.

25
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,684
That's terrific.

26
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,603
But that says so much about Luca.

27
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,105
He sees something he loves,
he leaps at it.

28
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,067
And just says, "We want that,
let's use this, let's use that."

29
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,820
I was looking over my notes
before we got started here

30
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:58,577
and I was looking at how his touch
has influenced every aspect of the film.

31
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,332
The words that I was meant to say
or the scenes, whatever they were about,

32
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,792
he had an impact on them

33
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,671
and they became alive in a different way
on the days that we did them.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,882
There's James Ivory's name.

35
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,176
You got a chance
to meet James, didn't you?

36
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,054
I spent a week with James upstate,
when I was 19,

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,474
when it looked like he was still
gonna be the director of the project.

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,020
And we watched <i>Maurice</i>
in his screening room.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,320
-His art is extraordinary.
-I always loved that Luca saves

40
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,033
the big, beautiful statue for his name
at the end of the title credits.

41
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,787
This was Day 1 of the shoot,

42
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,539
because, very luckily,
we got to shoot chronologically

43
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,166
or mostly chronologically.

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,545
And it just picks up right in the middle
of whatever you're doing,

45
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,464
-which I love.
-This is the first take, first scene,

46
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,550
first everything we shot.

47
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,853
We stayed in Crema, while we were there,

48
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,314
and shot in Moscazzano,

49
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,316
where this villa was.

50
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,985
Which is about a 20-minute drive away.

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,241
-Professor Perlman.
-Welcome, welcome.

52
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,868
That's another instance in which

53
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:28,083
Luca's camera was in a place

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,460
where it was a surprise.

55
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,463
And I don't think that camera
was out the window here,

56
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,049
even though that's the point of view.
I think they set it up on

57
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,263
the sort of a balcony we see later
in the film, that little patio outside.

58
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,226
The clothes, so evocative.

59
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,479
Yeah, Giulia did such a good job,
Giulia Piersanti.

60
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,565
IZOD shirts, all over the place,
I remember.

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,193
That shirt is the shirt of our producer,
Momo, whom she's married to.

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,279
In fact, 80% of my wardrobe is that.

63
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,030
That's Amira Casar.

64
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,825
In denim.

65
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,537
And I love that it doesn't punch in here

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,331
or make something big
of the first moment these guys meet.

67
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,917
May I bring your things up to your room?

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,086
-Sure. Yeah.
-My room?

69
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,966
Luca made a point early on of all of us
playing this with great lightness

70
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,802
and fun, as if it was an idyllic time.

71
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,141
I love the way
you blow the smoke out there.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,269
-Could that have been planned?
-No.

73
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,731
I love this.

74
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,026
-He's like...
-Welcome to another place.

75
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,783
Did you have anything to do with the
things that were put on the wall here?

76
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,827
No, that would've been Samuel,
our production designer.

77
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,204
-Wonderful.
-He did such an amazing job.

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,998
Yeah, I thought that was you,
off to the corner of the room.

79
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,793
I insisted on a picture of myself
in the corner of the room.

80
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,587
Yeah, I was thinking maybe that's
a rock band that Timmy's a part of.

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,923
I love how Armie lies down.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,885
My room is now your room.

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,056
And there's that shirt he has
that you end up with later on.

84
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,434
We have to share the bathroom.

85
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,062
And this dialogue's straight
from the book, I'm pretty sure.

86
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,236
I love the lightness of you there,

87
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,491
just how it comes in, nothing lingers.
It's just a moment and it's gone.

88
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,995
Just like this whole movie.
Moments and then they're gone.

89
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,500
That's beautiful, too.

90
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,962
I'm glad we get to see you doing
a little bit of that.

91
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,758
This would've been the first day,
I think, we shot this, as well.

92
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,177
And there, we can see that the weather

93
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,222
was already being
slightly unforgiving outside.

94
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,057
Vanda.

95
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,648
She looks like
she's a part of the house.

96
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,568
-Extraordinary. Yeah.
-One with it.

97
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,825
I think I was doing...
When I did this scene, I realised,

98
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,744
just because this shot lingers

99
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,291
for so long as I enter the bedroom,
drop the book...

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,962
I think I realised for the first time,
there's gonna be the permission

101
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,048
and the ability to just be
in so many scenes of this movie

102
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,801
and just exist and not really worry

103
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,263
about moving it forward expositionally,
but just be.

104
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,056
What a wonderful thing.

105
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,559
That's a great lesson.

106
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,897
I think I discovered that
during the course of this, as well.

107
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,784
Sorry.

108
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,454
Yeah.

109
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,331
We're being called for dinner.

110
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,958
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

111
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,793
Do you remember
any thoughts you had about

112
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,962
what you were thinking,

113
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,547
about your first impressions
of each other at this time?

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,507
I remember,

115
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,637
I don't know if it was my actor mind
or my Elio mind, but just not wanting

116
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,849
to tip anything too soon. And certainly,

117
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,977
the way it's mapped out in
André Aciman's novel,

118
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,729
in the source material,

119
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,691
Elio was very much at first,
not put off,

120
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,404
but his homoeostasis has been disturbed
by the confidence of Oliver

121
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,617
and how he just drapes his body

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,956
over my room without any sort of care
or thought that it's my room.

123
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,208
There are these
lovely moments throughout.

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,043
I love the way
he runs his hand across that.

125
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,169
Yeah, isn't that great.

126
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,213
And it's odd, as well,

127
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,174
because I remember things showing up
on set that hadn't been there before.

128
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,844
You know, such as tapestries like that,

129
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,721
or, all of a sudden,
something new would be there.

130
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:02,357
You have these microscopic moments
of introspection that I love about Elio.

131
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,360
-Look at that shot.
-Isn't that beautiful?

132
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,948
Yeah, you see something new every time.

133
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,911
Michael, you would infuse these scenes
with such a levity.

134
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,707
That was exactly what Luca wanted.

135
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,794
You know, that's the truth of these
situations, of these summer breakfasts.

136
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,257
How delightful to wake up every morning
and have

137
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,012
that kind of energy
around you and lightness.

138
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,431
And how delightful as an actor,

139
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,391
where the prescription
is always to behave naturally

140
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,435
within the given set
of circumstances.

141
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,271
And the given set of circumstances here
is to have a...

142
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,606
-Breakfast.
-Big, beautiful breakfast.

143
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,610
-Tap on your egg.
-Tap on your egg.

144
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,196
Have some peach, have some juice.
Have some espresso.

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,323
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

146
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,867
Really?

147
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,744
Should I take him to Montodine?

148
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,038
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

149
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,790
I know a lot of people
have seen the film and they reference

150
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,877
the fact that Oliver gets
a local bank account

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,713
as something that feels very true

152
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,592
-to a summer stay in a foreign place.
-Interesting.

153
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,428
Pomegranate.

154
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,806
I remember Luca saying that

155
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,561
those newspapers, as well,
had news of the day.

156
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,981
He was very specific
about what he wanted on the outside,

157
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,901
so that there would be
glimpses of the period here and there.

158
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,073
And that the news being reported
isn't the most optimistic of news.

159
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,867
Rather, if there's any sort of sombre
through line in the movie,

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
-it'd be in the front pages.
-The news.

161
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,079
Right.

162
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,511
You know, when you have a number
of shots like these, as a young actor,

163
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,931
when the prescriptions are quite simple,
just to ride around the corner,

164
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,144
it helps tremendously when it comes time
to do the larger, more dramatic scenes,

165
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,064
'cause you just find
a sense of a rhythm and flow

166
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,692
that's just not there when every scene
is some sort of expositional marker.

167
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,780
I love that about what this film does.
It lets you breathe.

168
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,744
This was the town centre of Crema,
where we were shooting and living.

169
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,704
And this was the real town centre

170
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,707
for the people that live
in the city all the time.

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:30,296
And my apartment would've been
right above Oliver, in this scene,

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,383
where I was staying throughout the film.

173
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,302
Besides my family, you're probably

174
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,304
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

175
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,266
I'm from a small town in New England.

176
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,517
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

177
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,437
So, what do you do around here?

178
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,774
Just read books.

179
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,944
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

180
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,696
-Yeah?
-Go out at night.

181
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,576
Is Elio trying to make
any kind of impression on Oliver here?

182
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,537
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

183
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,290
It's fascinating watching
this scene because it's...

184
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,876
And I think it's the way
a lot of this relationship,

185
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,296
the way it plays out
the first half of this movie,

186
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,924
it's just very much a game of masks.

187
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,177
All right, later.

188
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,224
And Elio just being stunned at the way
this brash American works.

189
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,145
And very attracted to it,
but I don't think he's realised it yet.

190
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,441
-I love the precocious music behind it.
-Right, right.

191
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,737
What is this?

192
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,325
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

193
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,993
These are archaeology?

194
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,786
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

195
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,954
Okay.

196
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,415
-More apricot juice?
-Yeah.

197
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,918
-Here, <i>tesoro.</i>
-Thank you.

198
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,377
Help yourself, darling.

199
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,754
Thanks.

200
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,093
-It's like I can taste that every time.
-I can taste it, as well.

201
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,845
And the music's so...

202
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,557
This music could've been playing in
all of our heads as we shot this scene.

203
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,518
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

204
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,022
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

205
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,025
I remember the empty weight in the room
when they would say "cut."

206
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,486
And there had been
such life infused before

207
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,656
and the apricot juice being brought in.
And all of a sudden it was...

208
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,076
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

209
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,286
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name...

210
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,080
That room had a life of its own.

211
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,666
-It really did. It really did.
-It felt like it was ancient,

212
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,917
stepping into it.

213
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,963
-It really did.
-It didn't have to do any work

214
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,799
about pretending to be anything.

215
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,801
However, in the case of "apricot,"

216
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,678
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

217
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,221
How so?

218
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,266
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

219
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,310
Latin word being
<i>praecoquum</i> or <i>precoquere.</i>

220
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,145
So it's "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

221
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,897
To be precocious or premature.

222
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,900
And the Byzantines, to go on...

223
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,820
I love that moment.

224
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,366
You can't tell if it's total security
on the part of Mr Perlman's

225
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,036
or if he has been
encroached upon a little bit.

226
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,166
I love the looks between you guys.

227
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,837
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

228
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,506
Flying colours.

229
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,925
I love that moment, Michael.

230
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,803
He does this every year.

231
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,514
That was something we all came upon.

232
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,474
That was something we all came upon.

233
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,892
I didn't know
if you wanted to say it, but...

234
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,146
No, it was something that Luca, I think,

235
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,648
sort of suggested this as a test

236
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,483
that he does to every student
every year.

237
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,236
That was not in the text before.
It was wonderful.

238
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,867
Oliver and Elio are wearing sunglasses
in this scene.

239
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,786
And I think the funny thing
on set that day

240
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,706
was that everybody
was wearing sunglasses on set.

241
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,877
Italian crews look about
10 times cooler than American crews.

242
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,004
I love this, too.

243
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,382
Just sort of the boldness
that Oliver, all of a sudden...

244
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,218
We haven't seen this yet,
but he's somehow or other

245
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,847
been in this establishment before.
He's hung out with these guys.

246
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,975
He knows all their names.
He's come to play poker with them.

247
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,186
He's made friends that have probably
never given Elio the time of day.

248
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,481
I don't know if Elio's ever seen
this place before.

249
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,655
It just seems like they've been
there forever. They're still there now.

250
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,579
And it was so helpful,
I don't know why this was the case,

251
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,374
but all the background actors
in this film

252
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,627
never played anything
towards the camera.

253
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,170
There was no awareness of the camera.

254
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,172
-Isn't that wonderful?
-It was so helpful.

255
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,718
No, no, no, no, no!

256
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,056
All of this seems just so evocative
of that time. There's a freeness of,

257
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,643
you know, the late '70s, early '80s,

258
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,940
when there was still an essence of
the '70s vibe and everything,

259
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,528
the beginning of IZOD shirts
and a new kind of,

260
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,281
I don't know,
perhaps moneyed culture coming in.

261
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,077
These people look like
they'd all hang out together.

262
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,664
So this moment's very, very specific.
It was straight out the book.

263
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,166
And there has to be
a moment of attraction

264
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,293
and then a moment of deference.

265
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,963
I had a lot of anxiety about this scene,

266
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,924
'cause in the book,
it's a number of pages

267
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,426
that describe one moment.

268
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,386
-...relax a little bit.
-I am relaxing.

269
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,221
Marzia, come here for a minute.

270
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,682
Back me up here.

271
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,600
-Feel that. Right there?
-Oliver.

272
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,935
-It's too tight, right?
-Yeah.

273
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,522
I love the dominance of having
one's girlfriend come over.

274
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,526
Okay, guys, ready?

275
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,740
Elio walks away here, feels a little
overshadowed, a little confused.

276
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,827
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

277
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,788
I remember Luca telling me
to keep the props in my hand here,

278
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,957
never put them down before I ran away.

279
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,126
And then watching it now, I get it,

280
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,671
because it adds
to the total confusion of the character.

281
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,925
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

282
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,343
Don't know.

283
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,721
What a movie star!

284
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,599
Tremendous effort in making it seem like

285
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,143
those rocks on the ground
weren't painful to the feet.

286
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,520
It worked.

287
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,025
This is so evocative of young men.

288
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,527
It seems like maybe

289
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,115
Elio was just beginning
to shave a little bit.

290
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,619
And the big razor he's using.

291
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,997
-We had played soccer...
-There's a whole soccer bit here

292
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,832
that they cut.

293
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,544
That's right. Luca had... Apparently,
the first cut of this film was...

294
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,880
-Four hours and 15 minutes.
-Oh, my God.

295
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,883
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

296
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,510
This is also from the book.

297
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,804
And we shot it the day before
and felt like we got it.

298
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,599
But then the light was off,
so we had to go back and shoot this.

299
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,767
How funny.

300
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,936
With his... "Later."

301
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,940
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

302
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,150
Won't we, darling?

303
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,569
I think he's shy.

304
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,321
You'll grow to like him.

305
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,447
What if I grow to hate him?

306
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,698
Oh, no, sweetheart.

307
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,495
-Take his plates away.
-Very well, madam.

308
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,040
Amira Casar added so much to this film,

309
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,002
just by the sheer nature of her being

310
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,715
and her fluency in so many languages
and her sense of humour

311
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,301
and this sort of combination
of the two of us

312
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,096
producing someone like Elio.

313
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,600
This is hysterical, all the '80s
commercial, or whatever show that is.

314
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,978
That's Carlo next to me, on the couch.

315
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,897
He's one of Luca's close friends and the
producer of a number of his projects.

316
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,190
I don't want to.

317
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,526
Why not?

318
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,069
Because I don't want to.

319
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,488
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

320
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,282
Because I don't want to.

321
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,908
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

322
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,536
I like the idea
that Elio keeps himself in the room,

323
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,454
even though he's a total curmudgeon
in this scene.

324
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,627
Play well, darling.

325
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,842
Did you practice this stuff?

326
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,304
This was one of the songs that

327
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,516
I worked with Roberto Solci on
for a month and a half.

328
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,855
You played all the way through this.
Everything is you, isn't it?

329
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,607
-Yep.
-That's amazing.

330
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,535
Did you feel a sense
that anything you did

331
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,621
under these circumstances was right?

332
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,416
Did you ever feel like, you know,
what is this moment about?

333
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,376
Or did you just come in
and sort of do it?

334
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,545
No. In fact, I mean, I almost...

335
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,673
And there's a script somewhere
that had physical beats plotted out,

336
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,342
but that would've been more...

337
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,720
There's a version of that film
that's artificial and actor-y

338
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,221
and based in the control room.

339
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,890
And there's a ton of spontaneous stuff

340
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,809
that didn't make it into the movie
because it would've been terrible.

341
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,061
But how great, it's there.

342
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,104
And how great to have a number of takes

343
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:12,735
and a director you know is not going to
expose you for the fraud you are.

344
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,409
-What is that?
-We had so many flies.

345
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,996
I thought you could see the fly
in this scene.

346
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,706
-It just ran by.
-Okay.

347
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,376
I was hoping I didn't just look like
a maniac blowing on my...

348
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,632
It's funny, because there's an idea
as an actor that the sexual prescription

349
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,759
or undertones of
many of these scenes would

350
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,636
maybe put you in your head.

351
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,472
But I know something like
this kind of scene is just...

352
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,308
The intimacy made it feel
more honest or natural.

353
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,770
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

354
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,316
-I have an allergy. It's...
-Yeah, me too.

355
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,568
Maybe we have the same one.

356
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,115
Why don't you and I go swimming?

357
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,117
-Right now?
-Yeah.

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,411
Come on. Let's go.

359
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,746
Do we have to go right now?

360
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,749
-I'll go get changed.
-Okay.

361
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,960
We found this blocking very naturally.

362
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,588
How would a young man
genuinely hide his erection?

363
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,926
The embarrassment of that.

364
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,479
See you downstairs.

365
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,407
-I love these shots.
-Yeah. These shots are amazing.

366
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,827
Our cinematographer,
Sayombhu Mukdeeprom,

367
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:51,041
he had worked on Luca's partner's film.
This was his first film with Luca.

368
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,213
The glasses, the <i>Risky Business</i> glasses.

369
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,757
The <i>Risky Business</i> glasses.

370
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,968
And this water was freezing.

371
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,765
And they built that
fountain area from scratch.

372
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,974
It was not there before,

373
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,976
but they made it look like
it had been there forever.

374
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,732
I think initially there was
a swimming pool in the script,

375
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,900
-or in the novel.
-Right.

376
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
We had this instead.

377
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,823
It's private.

378
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,658
You're not gonna tell me?

379
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,494
I'm not gonna tell you.

380
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,496
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

381
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,663
Elio.

382
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,415
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

383
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,336
We found this very naturally, too.
I think Armie just added that line

384
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,588
about hanging out with my mom.

385
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,966
And I said to Luca, I think I should go
running over and split them up.

386
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,968
-I love that you push him here.
-Yes.

387
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,386
-"Get out of the way."
-"Excuse me, excuse me."

388
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,597
All of a sudden,
there's a body language between you two

389
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,224
that didn't exist before.

390
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,184
Yeah, and that might be
the first moment in the film

391
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,811
that there's a real physical interplay.

392
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,273
So this is about a three-second insert
of me playing the guitar,

393
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,568
but this is something I spent
a month-and-a-half learning,

394
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,447
with Nicholas Guerrero,

395
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,950
who's a guitar player in Crema.

396
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,082
Play it again, will you?

397
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,459
-Look at the flies.
-Isn't that amazing?

398
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,882
I love Elio's irreverence,
doing things on his own terms

399
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,467
and your spontaneity
that you brought to all of this.

400
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,760
Follow me.

401
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,231
I always laugh at this scene,

402
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,735
because within the prescription
of the story,

403
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,697
Elio is riffing these pieces,
or it's an improv of sorts.

404
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,032
And the truth for the actor was, again,

405
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,119
that I was sitting in a piano studio
for a month-and-a-half

406
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,663
before shooting this scene,

407
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,708
really just trying to get
something half of what it's...

408
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,376
To what it's described in the novel.

409
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,545
But you did,

410
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,174
'cause that's sort of the beauty of
what we get to do, is throw ourselves

411
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,178
into the practice of something
and then throw it off

412
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,638
on the day we're doing it, if we can.

413
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,516
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,561
-Please.
-Of course.

415
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,779
I remember the ground outside
was so hot because of the sun.

416
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,740
And I'm barefoot in this scene.

417
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,992
And before takes,
I'd be standing on Armie's feet

418
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,368
and they'd say "action" and I'd say,

419
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,037
"Thanks for letting me
stand on your feet, brother.

420
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
"Let's go do this scene."

421
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,917
I love the little rock and roll
that comes on your face

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,126
during the course of that.

423
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,669
I can't believe you changed it again.

424
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,297
-I changed it a little bit.
-Yeah. Why?

425
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,758
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

426
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,343
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

427
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,345
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

428
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,971
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

429
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,389
In fact, we're not even sure

430
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,350
-Bach wrote it at all.
-Forget I asked.

431
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,507
It's young Bach.

432
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,926
Luca told me to swivel around
at the end of this.

433
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,179
-And you didn't? You did.
-There it is.

434
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:41,814
The camera just seems to find you there,
in the midst of something.

435
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,283
-That door is just...
-God, that door. I know...

436
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,910
And this is wonderful, too,

437
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,453
'cause I wondered
how this was going to be done.

438
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,455
What a beautiful way to sort of...

439
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,874
And it felt good.
That was actually my writing.

440
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,961
But I know they did
a number of takes

441
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,796
of the fan to try to get
that just perfectly.

442
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,423
There was a whole scene,

443
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,884
a whole text that was written for
the scene that Armie and I have here.

444
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,970
And I was so perplexed on the day,

445
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,014
because the camera was
going to be so far away

446
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,932
and I was sort of... "What's going on?"

447
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,936
It's just another texture in the story
which I absolutely loved.

448
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,771
And then there's this.

449
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,610
And it was great conscientiousness to
get that fish back in the water

450
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,989
-on the day.
-Right away, right after the take.

451
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,076
I love that scene
because it is unabashed,

452
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,537
non-cynical film-making.

453
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,207
It's just a beautiful shot
of a fish and a boy reacting.

454
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,544
There's the teamwork,
carrying it into the kitchen.

455
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,172
I love that. It's as if
they've been there for years.

456
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,347
I love how Sayombhu's camera
lingers on

457
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,641
the world.

458
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,310
Elio.

459
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,021
You sleeping?

460
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,815
I was.

461
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,568
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

462
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,863
-Wait.
-What?

463
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,656
Can't hear you.

464
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,584
"For the early Greeks,

465
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,294
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness...

466
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,672
-Peaches.
-Yeah, foreshadowing.

467
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,552
I loved walking
and jumping around these things.

468
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,137
Like the door you alluded to earlier,

469
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:41,558
everything in this villa
was so specific.

470
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,894
Doesn't make any sense to me.

471
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,773
Although, whatever that is,
some kind of feather or...

472
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:53,153
In the air, it's pollen or something
that has been blowing around.

473
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,988
That was all just there.

474
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,075
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

475
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,160
"Kind"?

476
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,246
Yep. Kind.

477
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,339
Armie's timing is so good in that scene.

478
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,262
This might be
my favourite scene in the film.

479
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,984
There's such openness in Esther's love.

480
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,902
Yes, it's unabashed.

481
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,905
There isn't any strain of maliciousness.

482
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,034
So sincere
and straightforward throughout.

483
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,202
It's a beautiful performance.

484
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,413
She and Victoire, as well.

485
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,791
What do I know?

486
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,543
I'd love to be in his shoes.

487
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,212
All the hair.

488
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,258
She wants him, no matter what!

489
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,982
I think these are the first moments

490
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,403
of self-aware percolating attraction.

491
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,242
There's so many songs that were written
around that time called "Lady."

492
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,621
Lady-this, this is Lady, Lady, Lady.

493
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,707
And I love the change here.

494
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,542
And that's our editor, Walter Fasano.

495
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,961
That's the editor of the film DJ'ing.

496
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,800
The change in music, there's a sense
of the new wave coming in.

497
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,678
Coming?

498
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,349
I'll come later.

499
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,142
I love the...

500
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,187
The blurriness
that comes in periodically.

501
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,272
You'll be watching something
and all of a sudden,

502
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,399
everything's out of focus,
but you don't care.

503
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,401
It just makes you want to look harder.

504
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:12,084
He seems so grown up in one moment
and the next, like a kid.

505
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,090
And the shoes.

506
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:23,845
And of course, this has been
discussed at length already.

507
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,097
Armie is so

508
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,850
fantastically unabashed
in this scene and yet,

509
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,270
it was his least favourite scene
to shoot in the film

510
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,648
and the one he says
that he was most tortured by.

511
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,401
And the truth is, there isn't
a song playing as we shot this.

512
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,654
There was a click track,
so there's only a click, click, click.

513
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,865
And that is not conducive to...

514
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,704
I don't understand why they can't
just play the music underneath.

515
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,873
-I don't understand that either.
-But it's great. I love that.

516
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:56,295
I love that whole number
you throw in there.

517
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,635
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

518
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,765
I love that Marzia's picking up on
undertones in the relationship

519
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,642
that Elio maybe
hasn't even picked up on yet.

520
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,060
Of Oliver.

521
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,948
Turn around.

522
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,711
Had they done this before, do you think?

523
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,840
You know what, no.

524
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:48,055
I think what Luca had said... I remember
Esther was miserable doing this,

525
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,557
because it was night-time

526
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,187
and we really did have no idea
what was lingering underneath the water.

527
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,902
I was kind of mouthing to her to
catch up as we were swimming away.

528
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,071
And then we'd swim back,
she'd get out and she'd...

529
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,657
We almost had sex last night...

530
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,201
Marzia and me.

531
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,952
I love Elio's boldness.

532
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,622
Well, why didn't you?

533
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,916
I don't know.

534
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,753
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

535
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,672
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out...

536
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,299
Some of the language...

537
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,717
Go ahead. Go ahead.

538
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,345
No, I just... Michael,
I love you in this scene. I mean,

539
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,932
a more ignorant parent would've

540
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,184
had a more blunted
or instinctual reaction.

541
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,645
And the wise parent, Mr Perlman, is...

542
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,064
-Would you like to come along?
-I would love to. Thank you.

543
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,651
-Smell this.
-Can I come, too?

544
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,320
On the condition you remain silent.

545
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,740
I love the allusion

546
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,412
to stories of Mr Perlman
getting exposed by Elio.

547
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,962
God, the bike served

548
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:08,635
this tone of people coming in and out
freely and without regard.

549
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,263
Can you tell him I came by?

550
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,559
I love the simple pink earring
that dangles around and playful.

551
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,770
It's so evocative of the period,
that colour.

552
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,856
He's a good dancer.

553
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,609
This is a charming, charming scene
between the two of you.

554
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,405
Fishing.

555
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,451
Come in.

556
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,453
What's he feeling at that point?

557
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:40,208
Well, it's exciting to talk to the lover
of who you're attracted to.

558
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,461
There's a certain game in that.

559
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,261
A moment of jealousy here.

560
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,516
This looks like
a couple of high school seniors,

561
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,437
just bringing their books
out of school and making plans.

562
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,740
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

563
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,951
A moment for Elio to establish

564
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,747
his autonomy to the region
and to the house.

565
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,165
What the rules are.

566
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,544
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

567
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,424
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

568
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,468
Great body.

569
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,261
Trying to get me to like her?

570
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,388
What would be the harm in that?

571
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,681
No, no harm.

572
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,808
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

573
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,525
I'll drive today!

574
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:51,571
I learned a little bit of Italian before
I got to Italy,

575
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,198
but my tutor was from the south.

576
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,785
So the bits of Italian
that I had to learn, I had to relearn

577
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,287
because there's a difference
between the south and the north.

578
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
What's going on, boys?

579
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:07,128
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

580
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,673
What? What?

581
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,887
To shoot in this region,

582
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,515
I think this was the one region we shot
in that wasn't chronological,

583
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,184
but this was maybe one of my
favourite moments of the shoot,

584
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,519
was getting to drive to...

585
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,898
Would this have been...
Would this have been Bergamo?

586
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,527
It's called the Grotto of Catullus.

587
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,280
I remember that about the place...

588
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,950
But this is in the lake region,
is it not? Or was it not?

589
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,663
My mic pack falls out here.

590
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,624
Which is why I always dragged
my shirt down.

591
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,792
That's wonderful.

592
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,211
At the top of this scene,
I remember, on the day,

593
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,672
because the grotto was called
the Grotto of Catullus,

594
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:55,218
I had remembered an A. E. Housman poem
that I had to say

595
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:02,475
in a play many years ago,
called <i>The Invention of Love.</i>

596
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,353
It was a poem by Catullus,

597
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,231
so I threw that in there
at the very top of the scene.

598
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,443
It was such a beautiful day, that day.

599
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,031
And that's an extraordinary...

600
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,784
I remember Armie and I
found that moment as Armie picked it up.

601
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,787
And then Luca said,
"That's great. Let's keep it."

602
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,749
And he said, "Just say <i>'tregua, "'</i>
which means truce.

603
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:32,339
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda...

604
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,382
I don't know if you remember,
Michael, that they...

605
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:40,221
We got boated out of the distance first,
before they got to bring the camera.

606
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,265
So there was a really lovely moment,

607
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,267
we just spent an hour
in the water in that boat,

608
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,977
just rocking back and forth with Armie.

609
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,229
This fellow's at number three.

610
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,899
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli...

611
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,486
This is quite an acting prescription,

612
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,238
to be reacting to absolutely nothing.

613
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,453
This is our green screen acting
in the movie.

614
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,130
God, I think James Ivory
and Luca came up with this

615
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,548
two years before the film's conception,

616
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,177
'cause I don't think... This is one of
the few bits that's not in the book.

617
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,224
I think in the book,
there was this event,

618
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,518
where they

619
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,773
go see, like, the murdering of fish
or something like that.

620
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,611
Elio!

621
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,655
Oliver!

622
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,285
I love this too.

623
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,122
This is one of the last scenes
we shot that day.

624
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,083
The energy this scene has
is very much what the energy was

625
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,585
on set for some reason.

626
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,213
-Are you going, too?
-No, no.

627
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,382
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

628
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,051
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

629
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:06,099
You know what, that's just so Armie.
The end of that scene.

630
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,021
I love how you guys
just toss the bikes away.

631
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,899
It's like you've been doing it
forever and ever.

632
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,317
It's just wonderful.

633
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,076
And the light.

634
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,210
I never noticed that.
Then it gets brighter.

635
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,051
I love these, you know,
not conventional shots of bodies

636
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,053
in this film that Sayombhu had set up,

637
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,557
like the shoulder blade there.

638
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,188
That kitchen.

639
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,107
The balcony.

640
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,573
What piece is that? Do you remember?

641
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,951
That's so beautiful.

642
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,676
<i>The Cosmic Fragments</i> by Heraclitus.

643
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:29,933
That's a voice-over track I laid down
in Midtown Manhattan,

644
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,310
five months after we did the film.

645
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,146
<i>The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing</i>

646
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,981
<i>so that
we cannot encounter them twice...</i>

647
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,692
I love getting to do this stuff
as an actor, too,

648
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,694
because in drama school, again,

649
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,531
it's about antagonism
or the conflict of a scene.

650
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,450
And here the prescription
was simply to be.

651
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,207
And Luca was always encouraging me to
run my hand across the things

652
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,127
I was coming across in the house
and at the field of play.

653
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,303
I love the shadow and the light
in this shot,

654
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,972
how that corridor was,

655
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,101
at times so dark
and at other times so bright.

656
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,077
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

657
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,915
Playing possum,
as my grandma used to say.

658
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,625
Leave the door open.

659
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,794
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

660
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,921
There's something else
completely going on.

661
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,194
This is another one of those scenes
where it felt like I had the gift,

662
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:11,034
of a minute or two minutes, to plan how
the sequence would play out naturally.

663
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,078
And I love this, too,
'cause there's maybe...

664
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,790
I think we did three versions
of this with a bathing suit

665
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,461
that are just different
sexual expressions of the same idea.

666
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:22,921
And the one that made it in

667
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,131
that's gonna come up here
is I put it on my head

668
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,718
and lean backwards
or kind of arch my back.

669
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,888
But there's a version I like a lot, too,
where I maybe ran around the bed

670
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:36,351
for three minutes. It's tough to
describe, especially literally,

671
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,686
but the sheets were all messed up.

672
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,899
And this one was
the most succinct of the takes.

673
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,488
This is from the book, as well.

674
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,572
The music of love comes in.

675
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,576
It seems to be

676
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,790
the theme of what Elio's feeling inside.

677
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,585
He hears Oliver's voice

678
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,797
and he comes alive.

679
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,348
There's a very specific mark
on the ground there to hit,

680
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,769
or else they wouldn't be able to
see Oliver revealed in the shot.

681
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:07,108
I love that he's hard to see
once he passes.

682
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,401
You get a glimpse of him.

683
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,115
That music is so evocative
of what's going on inside.

684
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,083
I loved shooting this scene,
with you in the mirror, Michael.

685
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,335
This was such a pleasure to shoot.

686
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,132
Darling, have you seen my <i>Heptaméron?</i>

687
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:37,680
Apparently there was a lot of rain
in the shooting of this film,

688
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,849
but I don't remember it too much.

689
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,351
I don't remember it as much, either.

690
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,937
Okay.

691
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,400
Lovely moment that the Perlmans
get to share together,

692
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,319
just reading on the sofa together.

693
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,115
You kind of get a glimpse into the
kind of lives they've lived for years,

694
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,243
just curled on the couch,
telling stories.

695
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,037
So, I'll translate, huh?

696
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,962
I remember shooting this scene

697
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,548
and Amira running her hand
through my hair and thinking,

698
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:17,178
"That is exactly what a mother would do.
That's exactly what my mom would do."

699
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,640
"...Though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

700
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,434
"Despite the friendship..."

701
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,564
"...That blossoms between them..."

702
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,483
That's another moment of Amira.

703
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,694
-She brought so much to this film.
-Yeah, of just

704
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,783
what if there's a joke
between the two of them

705
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,743
about this particular word?

706
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,371
It was just a colour
that she threw in there.

707
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,832
Wonderful.

708
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,917
"... He's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

709
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,712
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

710
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,226
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

711
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,651
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

712
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,487
I doubt that.

713
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,120
I love that there's no shame from the
guidance Elio draws from his parents.

714
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,415
There's nothing embarrassing about it.
There's nothing childish.

715
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,383
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

716
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,719
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

717
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,181
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

718
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,348
Right.

719
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,142
Of course, he knows that.

720
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,979
More smoke and mirrors.

721
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,525
But she's on her guard.

722
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,820
She senses a trap somewhere.

723
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,078
So, does he speak?

724
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,414
No.

725
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,834
He fudges.

726
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,297
It figures. He's French.

727
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,968
-I think they added that the day of.
-I love that.

728
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,931
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

729
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,476
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

730
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,229
Then why don't we go together?

731
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:32,480
Right now?

732
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,774
Yeah. Right now.

733
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,236
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

734
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,655
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

735
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,490
I love that.

736
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,618
The Talking Heads shirt, too,

737
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,623
and the cassettes.

738
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,378
-Mind if I put this in your bag?
-Yes, please.

739
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,182
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

740
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,684
Perfect. Thanks.

741
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:16,274
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

742
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,110
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

743
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,736
I think it helped.

744
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,575
I love that this scene is
ostentatiously about a wound,

745
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,912
but it's really about getting a stare
at someone's nice body.

746
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,094
That was a tiny door. You guys navigated
that really, really well.

747
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,470
Hold this for a second, will you?

748
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,974
Riding your bikes through it.

749
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,021
So this is a scene that we had rehearsed
and decided to do in one shot,

750
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,564
but Luca didn't have enough track

751
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:01,068
to do it in one shot, so he put a call
in to the production office in Milan

752
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,404
and they agreed to send enough track

753
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,531
but that it was going to take
about two hours to send,

754
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,825
so we rehearsed this scene
maybe six times.

755
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,036
We all broke for lunch.
We all sat in a cafe.

756
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,414
Not the one in this shot here,
but opposite in the square.

757
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,459
And when it came time to do it,
which is what we're watching here,

758
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,502
we maybe had an hour to shoot this

759
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,548
in two or three takes.
I mean, this was the second take.

760
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,642
Not bad, huh?

761
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,561
Not bad at all.

762
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,899
I thought you didn't smoke.

763
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,610
I don't.

764
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,243
-So, World War I I, huh?
-No. This is World War I.

765
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,497
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

766
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,750
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

767
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,461
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

768
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,838
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

769
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,217
Is there anything you don't know?

770
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,639
I know nothing, Oliver.

771
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,229
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

772
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,648
Again, the nightmare, as an actor,
would have been

773
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,276
to do this scene a foot from Armie
in a bunch of close-ups.

774
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,822
I don't know any actor
that could have pulled that off.

775
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:32,701
But instead, Luca gave us a prescription
to treat this monument

776
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:36,330
almost as a metaphorical barrier
between the two boys here.

777
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,545
Why are you telling me this?

778
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,175
'Cause I thought you should know.

779
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,929
Because you thought I should know?

780
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,058
'Cause I wanted you to know?

781
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,605
Because I wanted you to know.

782
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,986
Because I wanted you to know.

783
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,365
This repetition of the line,
is that in the text or is that just you?

784
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,160
Luca had said...
As I walk by the monument,

785
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,704
he said, "Repeat it to yourself
a number of times."

786
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,583
This is all one shot.

787
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,045
The bus going by.

788
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:31,010
And the bus, Luca had said in Q&A's,
was to serve as an interrupter,

789
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,055
another signifier to break the tension.

790
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,308
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

791
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,316
I love the idea that
if you are at a distance,

792
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,526
these boys might just
be having a conversation,

793
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,695
but up close and personal,

794
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,655
you know what they're talking about.

795
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,258
-Religion.
-Yeah, it was...

796
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,761
I was always curious about that moment.

797
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,764
The production design in the ceiling

798
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,933
of those posters
to the side is just perfect.

799
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,559
They mixed up all of my pages.

800
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,770
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

801
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,605
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

802
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,567
I love those lines.
They have nothing to do with anything.

803
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,362
Shouldn't have said anything.

804
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:32,821
Just pretend you never did.

805
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,157
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

806
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,996
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

807
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,750
Why do you think Elio is so bold here?

808
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,086
The thrill of getting to be
the younger lover.

809
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,463
Oliver's in the position
of responsibility.

810
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,803
I get to decide
whether to put a seatbelt on or not.

811
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,643
Hey.

812
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,396
Let's go, American!

813
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:10,985
If I had hit that car door,
that would have ruined the whole take.

814
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,154
Nope, just would have been Elio,
hitting the car door.

815
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,660
I love the movie magic of this shot,
and it's a gorgeous road

816
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,289
we take off on

817
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,960
and they set the camera up
right next to a trash processor.

818
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,046
Off to the left here,
there's a big, loud...

819
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,759
Funny. I love that this lingers, too,

820
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,137
and you want to watch them
the entire way.

821
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,686
Armie overtakes me.

822
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,398
It's hard to keep up with someone
that big and fast and strong.

823
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,283
And the camera just watches.

824
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,913
Pretty much.

825
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,963
I don't know if this woman was employed
that day or if she was just...

826
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,758
This might have literally been her home.

827
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:22,890
Well, a glimpse into
the generosity of the area, though.

828
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,686
-A more innocent time.
-Yeah.

829
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,239
Il Duce.

830
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,116
"People of Italy! "

831
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,118
Benito Mussolini.

832
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,498
-Armie's nickname for Luca.
-Which is what he would call him.

833
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,918
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

834
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,798
Beautiful.

835
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,648
This is one of the few
over-the-shoulder shots

836
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,983
of the movie
where Sayombhu put the camera on.

837
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,115
It's very brave

838
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,994
to be riding that bike
on such a rocky road with no hands.

839
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,956
Come on!

840
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,749
And the way he pops off that bike.

841
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,630
This was an incredible location
to shoot at.

842
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,428
I tried to petition Luca in this scene

843
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,848
to not make me say the name
of the mountainous region in the north

844
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,726
and he said, "Nope, you're saying it."

845
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,397
This is my spot. It's all mine.

846
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,734
Come here to read.

847
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,154
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

848
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,656
Straight from the book.

849
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,242
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

850
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,828
Spring is in the mountains.

851
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,080
The Alpi Orobie.

852
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,791
The water comes
straight down from there.

853
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,986
I like the way you say things.

854
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,238
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

855
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,699
So you won't, I guess.

856
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,538
I like the idea that
Elio was unrelenting

857
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,583
and even when
Oliver lets his guard down a little bit,

858
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,169
perhaps generously,
Elio jumps in right away.

859
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,130
There he is,
jumping right in, face-first.

860
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,759
I love that about
your entire performance.

861
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,512
You're making things
very difficult for me.

862
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,310
I love this aspect of it, too,
the playfulness between you two.

863
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,193
I love this, Oliver.

864
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:29,535
And this shot is almost a direct homage
to James Ivory's <i>Maurice,</i>

865
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,121
and there's a very similar shot
of the two lovers in the grass.

866
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,962
Us, you mean?

867
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,090
It's not bad.

868
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,217
It's not bad.

869
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,474
I love that the film doesn't show us
or tell us everything that's going on.

870
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,310
It allows us to have our own sort of

871
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,688
dialogue in our mind
as to what we think is going on.

872
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,387
How much of this was directed
and how much of it was just you guys?

873
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,018
There's a take where I don't lick
his face first before kissing him.

874
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,688
-But...
-Yeah, he plays with you.

875
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,273
Better now?

876
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,612
I know that
the most important beat of this

877
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:51,158
is that Oliver is the one to step away
and that there's a strong moment

878
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,119
where Elio tries to
reignite it right there.

879
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,998
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

880
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,333
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

881
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,709
and that's a good thing.

882
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,502
I wanna be good.

883
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,254
Okay?

884
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,888
Am I offending you?

885
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,938
Just don't.

886
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,738
I think it's starting to get infected.

887
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,114
"Look at my body again."

888
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,784
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

889
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,245
Under the illusion that
it's broken or bruised.

890
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,296
I love this scene.

891
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,049
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

892
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,469
-This is all Luca.
-My God, I love you.

893
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,680
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

894
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,516
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

895
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,560
I'd like to know what they think too.

896
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,480
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

897
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,775
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

898
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,485
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

899
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,780
And it's true, at the time,
Italy's government was in total turmoil.

900
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,824
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

901
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,575
What's that got to do with it?

902
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,452
What are you saying?

903
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,830
You're mad, darling.

904
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,873
You asshole!

905
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,836
-She's right.
-And you don't say anything to her.

906
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,881
These two are remarkable theatre actors
that Luca knew

907
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,928
and wanted in the film.
They wanted to touch upon

908
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,682
these things.
I'm sure he'll tell you all about it.

909
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,977
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

910
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,105
They broadcast <i>The Phantom of Liberty</i>
with constant interr...

911
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,649
Everyone loves Buñuel!

912
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,317
Let's hear his opinion.

913
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,694
They were remarkable.

914
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,030
They just came in and did this
over and over and over again.

915
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,615
Do you have an impression?

916
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,784
Darling, he's American.

917
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,202
That doesn't mean stupid!

918
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,415
I love it, they cut to him...

919
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,294
Just stop.

920
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,213
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

921
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,883
This is so subtle, too, in ways I love.

922
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,261
I'm going to go mad.

923
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,180
What's the matter?

924
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,224
What's wrong?

925
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,310
It's nothing.
It happens all the time.

926
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,271
The minor debilitation
that is a nosebleed.

927
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,357
You get used to absolutely everything.

928
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,527
But it's really the event of the scene,
which is fantastic.

929
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,619
This is lovely, too.

930
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,670
This is a little side nook
that the house had.

931
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,798
There's a tiny little bar area.

932
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:56,426
This is where Michael comes out,
earlier in the film, with the drinks.

933
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,304
Serving some cognac or whiskey,
whatever it was.

934
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,306
This is one of the rare

935
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,350
over-the-shoulder shots
in the movie, too.

936
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,310
The camera was on Sayombhu's shoulder.

937
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,480
Don't you realise
you're mixing everything up?

938
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,856
And they continue.

939
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,985
Yes, the idea that
they haven't stopped talking once.

940
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,113
Completely clueless
as to what's going on.

941
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,243
Elio.

942
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,203
You all right?

943
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,747
Sit for a second.

944
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,209
If you insist.

945
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,216
-That wasn't my fault, right?
-No.

946
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,053
I'm a mess.

947
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:46,143
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

948
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,396
Where did this stuff come from,
the toe thing?

949
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,232
-This is from the book. Wonderful.
-Is it?

950
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,317
Where did you learn to do that?

951
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,987
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

952
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,738
Trust me, it helps.

953
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,579
I used to have one of these.

954
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,247
-You used to?
-Yeah.

955
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,249
How come you never wear it?

956
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,419
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

957
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,714
That's a favourite line from the book.

958
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,299
I guess that works for your mother.

959
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,759
Funny witch.

960
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,636
What is that?

961
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,348
It's a line we looped 'cause
what I said was too inappropriate.

962
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,060
I hope not.

963
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,402
I always wondered what that was,
it goes by so fast but I was...

964
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,279
I love this moment as well.

965
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,072
Hey, are you leaving?

966
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,949
-Where's Elio?
-He's inside.

967
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,243
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

968
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,995
-Really?
-Yeah.

969
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,705
-Okay. Bye.
-I'll be back in a minute.

970
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,415
Don't go anywhere.

971
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,001
And I love that, "Don't go anywhere."

972
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,254
He waits just as long as he has to wait.

973
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:03,887
You okay?

974
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,557
"Come help me."

975
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,019
I love that.

976
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,021
Are we going out?

977
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,360
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

978
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,528
-She will?
-Yeah, she's a pain.

979
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,744
These girls could have chastised me
between takes

980
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,789
for being too

981
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,626
something.

982
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,672
And now we see Elio

983
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,133
with his star.

984
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,721
It's so beautiful, subtle.

985
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,308
I love this scene.
I remember at the top of the film,

986
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:53,228
Luca telling us to try to find
the comedy where we could.

987
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,897
All right.

988
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,274
I'm going out tonight.

989
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,693
-Don't make me worry.
-What are you talking about?

990
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,486
I love that.

991
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,698
-Let him do his own thing.
-Fine.

992
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,783
Why's she hassling me?
I'm 17.

993
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:10,829
A member of the family.
She's probably nursed Elio from a baby.

994
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,333
We sat on that bench, I think,
the very first day we got to the villa.

995
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,627
In fact, there's a picture
of Luca giving us notes on that bench.

996
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,920
I remember that.

997
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,047
I think he likes you too.

998
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,384
Amira has a perm in that picture.

999
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,555
She had decided to
change her hair afterwards.

1000
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,350
A while ago.

1001
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,357
I always think for a moment
when she does that,

1002
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,609
that she's going to tuck it back
into your shirt instead.

1003
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,612
Or acknowledge it,
but it's just unspoken.

1004
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,953
This music is so evocative
in this moment.

1005
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,997
And I love that Vanda is
still hard at work,

1006
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,207
although her pace here,
I'm just realising now

1007
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,043
it's the end of the day,
it's a little bit slower.

1008
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,586
Isn't that beautiful?

1009
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,548
I wonder how long
Elio's been sitting there?

1010
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,176
I'm waiting for Oliver.

1011
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,054
There's a wonderful

1012
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:14,476
mistake, or, not mistake,
but act of God I guess, here.

1013
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,021
Yeah, they said the film
came back a little damaged,

1014
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:22,692
but they found it to be
a great gift, Walter and Luca.

1015
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,905
Like inner turmoil,
whatever's going on in the story.

1016
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,325
I love that it's still there.

1017
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,914
That film lets the light in.
We shot on film.

1018
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,876
It lets the light in
and whatever happens,

1019
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,378
becomes imprinted on the film.

1020
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,261
It's really rare that music can reflect

1021
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,098
the inner life of things
that's going on,

1022
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:56,059
and his songs in this film
are extraordinary.

1023
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,395
This is one of the beautiful songs
that Sufjan Stevens contributed.

1024
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,731
A week before filming,

1025
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,818
we all sat down in Luca's living room
and listened to this

1026
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,196
and <i>Visions of Gideon,</i>
the other song he sent.

1027
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,093
To be awake would be embarrassing.

1028
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,197
It's one of the great things
about André Aciman's novel,

1029
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,911
things like pissing in a toilet
that are typically unattractive

1030
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,622
have a weird,
alluring effect in the mind.

1031
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:07,422
Traitor.

1032
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,476
Traitor.

1033
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,144
Music coming in.

1034
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,903
I love that capturing somebody,
we don't know what this is.

1035
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,323
It's just a moment...

1036
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,827
And then we're onto something else.

1037
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,665
All those magazines and books,

1038
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,126
those were all specifically
put down on that table.

1039
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,837
Everything in the room,
nothing was extraneous,

1040
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,675
the heaps of books
the Perlmans had everywhere.

1041
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,928
-Hey.
<i>-Hi!</i>

1042
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,765
It's me. Is that Marzia?

1043
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,642
<i>Sure it is! Can't you tell?</i>

1044
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,270
I love it. They haven't been
spending any time together.

1045
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,773
It's like you forget
what somebody's voice sounds like.

1046
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,109
This shot picks up
in the middle of what we shot.

1047
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:16,866
I remember just coming back,
but we did shoot a bit

1048
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,076
where I also leave and...

1049
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:23,122
Is that for me?

1050
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:25,833
Thanks.

1051
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,753
What is the book, do you know?
That's okay.

1052
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,427
I love that passageway.

1053
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:42,350
-From the Piazza Center...
-This was off the town centre. Exactly.

1054
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,937
...that led deeper into one part
of the town where we all stayed.

1055
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,564
If you walk to the left,

1056
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,233
my apartment would have been upstairs
and this is where...

1057
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,027
This is right in front of Armie's villa,

1058
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,697
right in front of Armie's apartment,
rather, and Luca's villa.

1059
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,615
...people who read are...

1060
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,409
kind of secretive.

1061
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,037
Esther brings such

1062
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,417
a great casual

1063
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:14,799
off-the-cuff delivery
to everything that she does.

1064
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:21,431
The character is
simultaneously so vulnerable

1065
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,474
but powerful, too.

1066
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:25,059
Why?

1067
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,563
Because...

1068
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,898
I think...

1069
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,942
you're going to hurt me,

1070
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,819
and I don't want to be hurt.

1071
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,780
How lucky you are
to be able to speak a foreign language.

1072
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:44,662
There's something about being
an English speaker and watching

1073
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,750
a foreign language, it just seems oddly
to me somehow more real.

1074
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,753
It's just a different way
to communicate.

1075
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,546
You're so hard.

1076
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,839
I love that

1077
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,928
she instigates a different
sexual energy here that I match

1078
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,597
and then Marzia just becomes

1079
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,307
a little flustered
and wants to take it a little bit.

1080
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,312
Have you had to do any scenes
like these before?

1081
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,606
-Not like that, no.
-No.

1082
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,068
Must have been nerve-wracking.

1083
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,285
'Cause this just captures
the time in their lives so beautifully.

1084
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,582
This was very much supposed to be
her first time.

1085
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,127
Instant shame.

1086
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,549
That's such a great camera shot as well.

1087
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,886
You guys are so lovely in this.

1088
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,097
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

1089
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,310
Fuck, that felt good.

1090
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:54,107
-Was any of that scripted?
-No, that's all just talking.

1091
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,109
Fantastic, that's so great.

1092
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:01,823
-This is wonderful, too.
-This is straight from the book.

1093
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:08,579
God, it's totally Luca's genius
in working in the voice-over,

1094
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,375
but this was one of the parts
of the book, the obsession,

1095
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,420
and it would've been
really hard to translate to film

1096
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:17,338
in lesser hands than Luca's.

1097
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:22,635
I was given a lot of
professorial dialogue as well

1098
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,221
that all got extricated away

1099
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,683
from the telling of the story,
which is rightfully so,

1100
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,186
wonderful in the novel but unnecessary
in this telling of the story.

1101
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,982
All Luca's.

1102
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,696
I love that shot.

1103
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,615
Feels Hitchcockian or something.

1104
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:50,037
I love that it only lingers for a moment
and now we're into somewhere else.

1105
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,414
And do you remember, Michael,

1106
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,250
how specific the timing had to be
of this sequence?

1107
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,460
Yeah.

1108
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,629
And this might have been
the scene we did the most in the film.

1109
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,924
I don't play poker.

1110
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,136
Several hundred colour slides
of our boxer and the others like him

1111
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,096
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

1112
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,808
There was a whole other scene
that was taken out of this as well

1113
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:11,976
about poker playing.

1114
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,771
Armie had been off
playing poker the night before

1115
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,063
which I had forgotten about.

1116
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,526
I love Oliver's exhaustion here,

1117
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,489
and Mr Perlman's relentless enthusiasm
for the subject at hand.

1118
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,576
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

1119
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,287
Right.

1120
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,502
-Lot of cigarette smoking in this film.
-Lot of cigarette smoking in this film.

1121
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,380
Don't smoke cigarettes, kids.
No, I'm kidding.

1122
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,052
The art is so
extraordinarily beautiful though.

1123
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,975
God, it's fun for me
to even watch this moment 'cause

1124
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,686
it's just so exciting when I wanna...

1125
01:11:56,103 --> 01:12:00,316
I love that you don't need to read it
and that we hear what it is.

1126
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:03,194
When a lover

1127
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,447
throws the tennis ball back,
that is a thrilling feeling.

1128
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:11,577
And the Elio spin.
Which reoccurs, which I love.

1129
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,081
<i>Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.</i>

1130
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,504
<i>Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.</i>

1131
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,882
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

1132
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,469
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

1133
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,347
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

1134
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,308
This could be a description of Oliver.

1135
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,982
"Is he trying to provoke me?"

1136
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,361
-This shot, it's so weird, I love it.
-It's so great.

1137
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,248
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

1138
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,126
-Also known as Sonny and Cher.
-Okay.

1139
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,379
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

1140
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:07,925
We debated back and forth
whether it should be Sonny and Cher.

1141
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,012
I think in the novel
it's Laurel and Hardy.

1142
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,847
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

1143
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,307
I'm not wearing it.

1144
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,516
Oliver?

1145
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,603
Hey, what time you got?

1146
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,813
It's 2: 00.

1147
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,484
I love the complicity.

1148
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,613
-Later.
-Later.

1149
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,916
-Barely fits through that door frame.
-Yeah, so funny.

1150
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,792
Mafalda.

1151
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,294
She's amazing.

1152
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,423
And they're all charmed by Oliver.
They all love him.

1153
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,929
She was stunned and instantly

1154
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,014
-glad to see that it's him.
-Delighted.

1155
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,350
In the outdoor.

1156
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,230
I love how far he is already
when he gets back down there.

1157
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:05,983
This stuff was a lot of fun
to shoot with Esther,

1158
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:11,322
and Luca just said try to go in and out
of the water as much as possible

1159
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,991
with your intertwining bodies.

1160
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,039
Perpetually looking at that watch.

1161
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,874
Hello, Mafalda.

1162
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:22,959
Marzia.

1163
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,252
She's witnessing the whole thing.

1164
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,380
Where are we going?

1165
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,714
You'll see.

1166
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,678
-Where do you guys go here?
-This is in the attic.

1167
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,056
The idea being that

1168
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,602
what the cove is, or not the cove but...

1169
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,232
I love the playfulness.

1170
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,706
If Armie was too lazy
to smoke a cigarette outside

1171
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,040
while we were shooting,

1172
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:06,335
he would just go up to this attic
and smoke one up there.

1173
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,007
I don't think I ever saw it
the whole time we were there.

1174
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,383
You smelled it.

1175
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,053
The attic, not the cigarettes,
my apologies.

1176
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,973
You didn't smell the attic.
That'd be weird.

1177
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,893
-I love the dust that emerges from this.
-Fantastic.

1178
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,104
They don't care.

1179
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,942
I remember Luca speaking about the song
on the radio as well and how specific

1180
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,069
he was about what he wanted it to be,

1181
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:36,699
that it was unique that that song would
have been played at that time of day.

1182
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,916
I remember I couldn't get
this fucking watch

1183
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,252
to just land the way
I wanted it to land.

1184
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,379
But how great is that?

1185
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,432
And here you go, heading into
another intimate scene.

1186
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:05,644
Is it any trepidation just sort of
throwing yourselves into it?

1187
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,731
You guys seem to have a great trust
between the two of you.

1188
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,775
Yeah, and it certainly is the...

1189
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,279
By requisite of what the characters
are going through here,

1190
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,615
I'm leading the dance a little bit so...

1191
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,743
And the only thought
before the take or during the take is

1192
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,996
that Esther as an actress is comfortable

1193
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,957
and nothing is crossing any lines
that we'd set out in advance.

1194
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:34,924
But the cunnilingus that's performed
is very much true to the novel as well

1195
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,678
because the experience
they have formatively isn't intercourse

1196
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:43,933
but it's something like this,
and then I'll look at the watch here.

1197
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,226
Again.

1198
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:54,944
And I love the idea here that

1199
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,072
they've already made love
but that they cannot stop going at it.

1200
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,742
The youthful bodies
exploding with hormones.

1201
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,206
I love her.

1202
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,708
Her messy hair.

1203
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,462
It's pretty obvious
what they've been up to

1204
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,089
and they have to come over
and say hello.

1205
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,551
I think this is known as
the walk of shame.

1206
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,555
-How are you, buddy?
-Hey!

1207
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,432
This is Peter Spears,
one of the producers of the film.

1208
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,184
He made this film happen,
and that's André Aciman.

1209
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:30,437
André Aciman is the author of the novel.

1210
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,273
So, Peter is in pink
and André is in blue.

1211
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:33,732
Hello.

1212
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,152
-Marzia, remember Isaac?
-The girl from Paris?

1213
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,904
This was all improv'd dialogue.

1214
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,573
No, no. I have to go.

1215
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,366
-You're sure?
-Yes.

1216
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,703
-Have a nice evening.
-Thank you.

1217
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:46,787
Goodbye.

1218
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,915
He still steals a kiss.

1219
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,044
Now, what is this
that you're pointing out?

1220
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,213
I think the idea is
that there was some china

1221
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,757
that perhaps they had
sent as family friends

1222
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,636
-on the table in the distance.
-Okay.

1223
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,014
-Yes, you can.
-It'll look like a put-up job.

1224
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,142
And I love this scene, Michael,
this was fun to shoot.

1225
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:12,062
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

1226
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,648
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

1227
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,609
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

1228
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,611
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

1229
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,071
-That's what Mom calls them...
-Then you accept gifts from them.

1230
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,074
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

1231
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,785
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

1232
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,163
An audience favourite, that line.

1233
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,457
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age...

1234
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,960
Did we give this scene any idea
of playing it

1235
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,797
more seriously or dramatically?
No, that would have been wrong.

1236
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,967
I don't think so. I think it was
sort of one of those things...

1237
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,303
I think, from what I can sense is, that

1238
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:47,056
Professor Perlman gets
such a kick out of Elio

1239
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,226
that as serious as he wants to be

1240
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,645
and as, you know, rigorous a parent
he chooses to be

1241
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,814
in moments, or the absence of rigour,

1242
01:18:56,065 --> 01:19:02,446
he can't help but adore
his son's irreverence and playfulness.

1243
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:06,575
But he has to keep a straight face
when he says things like that.

1244
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:15,793
I touch my eye to wipe some sleep away
there for a moment.

1245
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,963
-I always loved that moment.
-Lucas said, "Keep that, keep that."

1246
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,883
He's all about capturing
whatever the natural moment is.

1247
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,012
And I love how the music picks up here
as Armie emerges.

1248
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,726
There was something so surreal

1249
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,895
even when we were
shooting this scene, it felt like a...

1250
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:42,152
In a very warm way, but
a ceremonial goodbye to

1251
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:48,158
the boy's virginity and innocence
to some capacity.

1252
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,205
-I guess it is that.
-But with all the...

1253
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,582
"And here's your watch.
Don't forget your watch."

1254
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,043
And I always figured
that watch moment was maybe a...

1255
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,546
The most subtle of moments

1256
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,383
of understanding from Mr Perlman.

1257
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,602
And we get a glimpse into

1258
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,023
the private life of the Perlmans

1259
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:26,071
and how much fun they have
and how important it is for them,

1260
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,367
I don't know, to bring in people
from the outside world

1261
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,663
and how much joy in life they have.

1262
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:46,342
That shot right before this one, Armie
might take a hundredth of the frame.

1263
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,635
He's tiny in that shot

1264
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,305
and yet he's everything.

1265
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,527
You could survey most of the house
from that place.

1266
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,114
And people would
gather up there sometimes.

1267
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,827
I'm glad you came.

1268
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,633
And <i>Visions of Gideon</i>
is brought in for the first time.

1269
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,854
This almost seems in slow motion,

1270
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,237
the creeping.

1271
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,207
It's 'cause we didn't want you to hear.

1272
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,672
This scene was a lot of fun to play.

1273
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,467
It's nice.

1274
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,810
In the book and in the movie,
but it's not clear,

1275
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,688
and that's not it, that's a joint,
that's not a cigarette.

1276
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,819
Unfortunately, we never punch in
close enough to see that.

1277
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,404
That's okay.

1278
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,121
You okay?

1279
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:45,794
Me okay.

1280
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:47,838
That's from the book, too.

1281
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,239
-Can I kiss you?
-Yes, please.

1282
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:38,180
I think it's so funny and so important

1283
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:42,226
for the playfulness to still be there,

1284
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,771
and you guys are just so full of it.
I love that.

1285
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:49,983
Just a random moment
that presented itself.

1286
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:53,237
As an actor, those are
just the greatest of gifts,

1287
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,365
can't anticipate it, can only react.

1288
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,536
And the stillness and the whole way
when those trees aren't moving

1289
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:05,165
and the light's not coming through and
this is another lovely moment caught.

1290
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:15,759
What are you doing?

1291
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,844
Nothing.

1292
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,483
Does this make you happy?

1293
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,945
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

1294
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,863
I'm not gonna get...

1295
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,211
I remember
when we were blocking this out,

1296
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,590
and we were trying to kiss
where I was way above him,

1297
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:56,466
but then we mapped out that

1298
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,969
I would have to go back down
before we started to kiss.

1299
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:07,561
You forget as an audience member
in the intimate scenes

1300
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:11,064
that you're watching
that there are people all around you

1301
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,400
while this is going on.

1302
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,195
Or I'll pull it.

1303
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:35,631
It's one of the beauty of how the camera

1304
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,802
-just steps away.
-Allusion to the time period.

1305
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,099
And I wouldn't even try
to do it justice,

1306
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:48,518
'cause Luca will do it
when he describes it,

1307
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,979
but I love the way he talks

1308
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:53,148
about the sexuality

1309
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,152
or lack of sexual close-ups
in this film.

1310
01:25:58,487 --> 01:25:59,821
This is not about that.

1311
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,249
I love that shot, too, prior, you almost
don't even know what you're looking at.

1312
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:24,513
Did you guys talk at all
about the morning-after idea here?

1313
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,349
And we're not quite there yet,
this is still the night of...

1314
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,351
Okay, sorry.

1315
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,563
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

1316
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,316
I was not envious that Armie had to

1317
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:40,529
say the title
of the god-damn thing in a line.

1318
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,615
-Yeah, and he does it beautifully.
-He does it absolutely beautifully.

1319
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,786
-That'd be one to butter up.
-Yeah.

1320
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:50,580
-Oliver.
-Elio.

1321
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,586
Yeah, none of that seems
at all heavy-handed,

1322
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,296
so beautifully just simple.

1323
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,883
The blue shirt. Again.

1324
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,178
Did we make noise?

1325
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,472
Remnants of the lovemaking.

1326
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,142
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

1327
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,729
And the anxiety is about Mafalda
more than the parents.

1328
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:21,778
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

1329
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:27,117
I remember Luca telling me
to throw that shirt there on that mark

1330
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,163
and thinking it was inconsequential
but then you see it after.

1331
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,792
And then there's that.

1332
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:48,430
So we had scripted the dialogue for
this scene almost straight from the book

1333
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:54,227
and it just felt a little heavy-handed
and you knew exactly

1334
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:57,898
what this tension that had emerged
between the lovers was.

1335
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,485
And then we did a take with Luca
where we didn't say anything

1336
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,487
and this is the one.

1337
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:06,323
And it just plays out
a physical dialogue

1338
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:09,493
and as an audience member I find it

1339
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,579
to be more illuminating,
leaves more to the imagination, too.

1340
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,039
I agree.

1341
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,479
Let's go swimming.

1342
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,320
I love the bagginess
of that shirt that you're wearing,

1343
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:48,073
how enormous it seems
on your sweater, whatever it is.

1344
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:53,537
And I think Elio
unknowingly sees the power

1345
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:57,207
in the relationship
at this moment briefly.

1346
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:02,546
Is this in the script,
this place, this swimming,

1347
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,799
do you know?

1348
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:09,094
It almost seems extra,
but it's so beautiful at this point.

1349
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,847
It certainly wasn't scripted to be
at opposite ends of the lake,

1350
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,182
which really is
a beautiful visual metaphor.

1351
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,059
I think it's something
we found on the day.

1352
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:22,774
I remember not wanting to say anything
in response to Oliver in this scene

1353
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,943
and Luca saying
I should say no in response

1354
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,154
and now watching the movie,
he was absolutely right.

1355
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,118
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

1356
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:34,578
No.

1357
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,876
It wouldn't have made any sense.

1358
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:45,922
And I like that look back
I give him there,

1359
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,507
just to make sure he's not too upset.

1360
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,118
And the geography of the boys' bedrooms

1361
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,621
is described almost
exactly like this in the book,

1362
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,582
and the fact that we found a place
that had a bathroom that...

1363
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,543
-Isn't that wonderful?
-Lent itself to that... It's incredible.

1364
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,812
What do you think's
going through his head here?

1365
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,441
Well, shirt's come off,

1366
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,570
so, and he's just relaxing,
he's maybe gonna get in bed, take a nap.

1367
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:54,115
I'm wondering
what Oliver is thinking here,

1368
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:57,035
what the moment about calling you back

1369
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,496
as you've decided to go
to your separate rooms.

1370
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,540
There's this again.

1371
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,877
I remember Luca telling me
to put my arms up, here.

1372
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,215
Well, that's promising.

1373
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:11,591
You're hard again.

1374
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,009
Good.

1375
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,011
-Power seized.
-Yeah.

1376
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,015
I love that you can see
through the door.

1377
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,518
And I'm looking through the door.
I'm still there.

1378
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,812
I don't know
how many people noticed that.

1379
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,815
That's for, like, the ninth
or tenth viewing or something.

1380
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,191
It's great.

1381
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,285
I love the ambiguity of this moment.

1382
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:45,125
Is it a warm hello,
or is it a ploy to get him jealous?

1383
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:52,132
And, Michael, I still see Mr Perlman
in the scene, and I wondered

1384
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,885
how much does he know?
It seems like he's all-knowing, almost.

1385
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,681
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

1386
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,558
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

1387
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,476
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

1388
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:05,854
Later.

1389
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,983
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

1390
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:12,944
Okay. So later.

1391
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,404
Later.

1392
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,909
Look at Amira.

1393
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,625
Oliver.

1394
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:34,340
I always found it interesting
in the discussion of the upcoming scene,

1395
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,093
there's a guy behind you
during this sort of

1396
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,305
very intimate conversation
that you're about to talk about,

1397
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,143
and there's no shame
in the talking of it.

1398
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,105
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

1399
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,357
That man is Stefano,

1400
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:56,029
who has the most delicious restaurant
in all of Crema, Via Vai.

1401
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:58,323
That's where Armie had
an eight-hour lunch once.

1402
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,286
I don't want you to regret anything.

1403
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,915
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

1404
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,292
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

1405
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:10,585
-one way or another.
-No, I...

1406
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,879
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

1407
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,423
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

1408
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:19,177
And that's the shot in this film
I see the most of myself in,

1409
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,388
with the stuttering and the manicness.

1410
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:30,980
Are you happy I came here?

1411
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,614
I would kiss you if I could.

1412
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,372
I love watching this
in theatres for this moment

1413
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,291
because you can kinda feel
people tense up a little bit.

1414
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,961
Times change.

1415
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,838
Thank God we had the partisans.

1416
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,298
That's our script supervisor, Rachel.

1417
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:01,261
What do you think of Bettino?

1418
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,055
Beautiful shot.

1419
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,601
I love Amira's hat in this scene.

1420
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,855
I don't know. We'll see.

1421
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,860
Anyway, they make the rules.

1422
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,073
Pasquina!

1423
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:23,408
Hello.

1424
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,868
Hello, ma'am.

1425
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:27,912
-Tortelli cremaschi.
-Yes.

1426
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,125
Which is a dish of the area.

1427
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:35,628
A little sweet for my tasting,

1428
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:40,383
but it's all right.
You know, the book falls apart here.

1429
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:46,347
That Elio is just tossing
the pits on the floor.

1430
01:34:54,647 --> 01:35:00,612
Was there any sense of trepidation
going into this scene?

1431
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,573
Luca had trepidations about it because

1432
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:06,242
he thought maybe it worked better
as a literary metaphor,

1433
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:09,495
and he just had doubts about it
ever making it into the movie.

1434
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:13,708
So, there was not a ton of anxiety
because I simply thought,

1435
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:16,711
"Well, if this sucks,
it's not be gonna be in there."

1436
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,260
We just kinda found this moment because

1437
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,596
I don't think any of us realised
how hard it is to...

1438
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:31,100
Reach into a peach
and take the core out.

1439
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,830
Oh, fuck.

1440
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,027
I think the idea here was just,
how would it actually happen,

1441
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,780
and what would actually happen
in this kind of scene or scenario.

1442
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,451
In that anything comedic or

1443
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:36,874
ostentatious about it
would just make it ring untrue.

1444
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:48,720
Love how the music builds up
to the moment, too.

1445
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,426
Fuck.

1446
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,232
You know, he's like, he doesn't know
what to do with his hands here.

1447
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:01,793
They talk about, in acting classes,
being private in public.

1448
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:07,632
And it just seems the quintessential
private in public scene to me,

1449
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:12,053
how you're asked to do something
that couldn't be more private.

1450
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,352
And that noise is so European to me.

1451
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,523
Was it cicadas outside? Not cicadas...

1452
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:27,527
-Yeah, I think so, yeah.
-And then those birds...

1453
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:32,490
-Sounded like there was an owl as well.
-Yeah, that owl noise...

1454
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:42,208
-Tastes something, something amiss.
-It's wonderful.

1455
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:45,461
What did you do?

1456
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:47,839
-Nothing.
-No?

1457
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,258
Armie's so great in this.

1458
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,474
Oh, I see.

1459
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:01,227
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

1460
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,562
What's next? Minerals?

1461
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,313
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

1462
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:05,440
You know that's me.

1463
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,694
-How much of this is scripted, too?
-This was all scripted.

1464
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,072
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

1465
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,241
This scene was terrifying because...

1466
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,077
I'm glad it came out presentably

1467
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:21,080
because I thought,
"How does it take this wild turn

1468
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:23,583
"in this fun scene?
How does it take this...

1469
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,170
"Or in this playful scene?"

1470
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,089
-What are you doing?
-Stop.

1471
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,175
-You're fucking hurting me.
-Then don't fight.

1472
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:44,896
So all this is in the script?

1473
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,064
This was scripted, yeah.

1474
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,861
I just thought it was something
that you guys found.

1475
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:56,449
Sorry.

1476
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:58,075
It's okay.

1477
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,708
It's okay.

1478
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,388
It's okay.

1479
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,016
I don't want you to go.

1480
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,231
God, we wasted so many days.

1481
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:29,899
Why didn't you give me a sign?

1482
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,400
-I did. I did.
-You didn't give me a sign.

1483
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,736
My friend, Joey, came to the screening
the other night

1484
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,696
and said this was
his favourite scene in the film.

1485
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,199
He felt like this scene captured

1486
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:42,036
the lovers comfortable around each other
more than any other scene.

1487
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:46,624
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

1488
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,000
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

1489
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:50,127
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

1490
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,339
I don't know.

1491
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,971
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

1492
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,473
I didn't know that.

1493
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:07,520
And Luca gave me the direction there
to put my hand in his shirt like that.

1494
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,064
Where is this shot?

1495
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:14,610
This is right off the stairs
that lead downstairs

1496
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:17,697
-into the area with the pool.
-Oh, yeah.

1497
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:27,164
I love how all the scenes
just bleed into each other.

1498
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:31,043
He's gone.

1499
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:39,468
I like that I look genuinely exhausted
in this scene.

1500
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:52,231
"For Oliver.

1501
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:54,692
"From Elio."

1502
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:06,245
Elio?

1503
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,381
Lady in red.

1504
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,051
You disappeared for three days.

1505
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:26,223
I had to work.

1506
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,142
Full of shit.

1507
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:29,685
You completely disappeared.

1508
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:33,230
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

1509
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,610
I had a lot to do.

1510
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:48,954
Am I your girl?

1511
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:51,957
I love that that's in English.

1512
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,961
Yeah, Esther was so good in this scene,
because to say a line in a language

1513
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:58,589
that you know is not your own,
that is so vulnerable.

1514
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:02,760
I remember we finished
shooting this scene, and I said,

1515
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:05,054
"You absolutely murdered that,"

1516
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:08,808
because that is not easy to do.

1517
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:11,102
I would not want that
prescription in a scene.

1518
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,271
Michael, I just love
the energy in this scene.

1519
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,440
This is one of my favourite scenes
in the film.

1520
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,820
Did he tell you to have that energy

1521
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,572
or did you guys assume it,
lying in the seats like that?

1522
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:28,285
There's just something about
getting to lie in the sun, you know?

1523
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,747
Makes you behave a particular way.

1524
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,879
You get a sense of sexuality
between the couple.

1525
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:41,006
You know you've been
our favourite student?

1526
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,342
Just putting their hand on each other,

1527
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:46,011
and that's just a glimpse
into what that scene was.

1528
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,222
Yeah, there's more there.

1529
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:51,892
We're all gonna miss Oliver.

1530
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,437
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

1531
01:43:56,605 --> 01:43:59,775
It's such genuine affection between
all of us in the making of this film,

1532
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:02,111
but it just seems like it was just...

1533
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,612
Oliver, Oliver.

1534
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:06,490
As the time passed, it just felt like

1535
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:09,160
it was gonna be over,
and it was a shame.

1536
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,539
There was such pleasure.

1537
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:15,416
Later. Later, later, later.

1538
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:19,170
I love the way Amira slaps
Oliver's back in that scene.

1539
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:27,511
-I like that you smash my face.
-Yeah.

1540
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:33,726
Oh, no.

1541
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:40,149
I love the "better luck next time" look
he gives her.

1542
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,741
And I love how Armie kinda tells me to

1543
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:52,745
not ask so many questions here
when he sits back down.

1544
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:55,706
It just feels so true,
even to our relationship in real life.

1545
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:01,712
You know, the pestering on my part
and him going, "Leave me alone."

1546
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:05,800
-What?
-Nothing.

1547
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:08,469
A lady's staring
at the two of you, behind.

1548
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:13,307
-You know, I never noticed that.
-Yeah, she's like, "Uh-huh."

1549
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:16,560
And this moment is extraordinary to me,
and I don't...

1550
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:20,564
You're in a bus, but for some reason,
we're following this trail.

1551
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:26,403
-I'd love to hear what Luca has to say.
-Yeah, I would, too.

1552
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,365
It's so evocative, and it's...

1553
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:36,121
-I wonder...
-What the thought was here.

1554
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:41,335
This was one of the most fun days
I've ever had shooting anything.

1555
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:45,172
We took a van to the bottom
of this location, that took two hours,

1556
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:47,299
and then there was
a separate hike with the crew,

1557
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:50,886
where everybody carried one piece
of equipment up to these locations.

1558
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,805
There was a lot of hiking in this film,
wasn't there?

1559
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:55,432
This shot actually wasn't, because
when we were running through there,

1560
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:57,893
it was thorny,
so our legs were getting torn up.

1561
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,647
And wasn't this, like,
a reservoir that had to be...

1562
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:05,192
This was a dam. So, it was an
artificial dam, and we had one shot,

1563
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,319
you know, we're gonna get to here,
with the waterfall.

1564
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:10,072
We had one go at it,
and they played one of those

1565
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:14,118
sirens they played in World War I I.
They didn't want people to go inside.

1566
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:16,078
-"The water's coming! "
-Exactly.

1567
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,789
-Isn't that amazing?
-This shot here.

1568
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,250
This is right when it emerged,

1569
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,502
and I think there's a cut here
to when it's even...

1570
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:24,670
Yeah, exactly.

1571
01:46:24,753 --> 01:46:26,881
<i>Lord, I no longer believe</i>

1572
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:31,594
-We had one shot at this.
-It was perfect.

1573
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,054
The abandon.

1574
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:37,308
You know, maybe I shouldn't
reveal this, but so be it.

1575
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:41,979
I stumble there,
and I just became so exhausted,

1576
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:45,566
and Armie runs by me going,
"Keep going, motherfucker! "

1577
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:47,651
"I'm sorry, I can't. I'm so..."

1578
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:50,529
Like, I guess they cut
before I really stopped,

1579
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,616
but I was so exhausted.

1580
01:46:53,699 --> 01:46:56,869
And here, you know,
one of those rocks I'm hiding behind,

1581
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,954
and Armie's hiding
behind another one of the rocks.

1582
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:01,749
Just movie magic.

1583
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:07,046
This was our last day of filming.
This was in Bergamo.

1584
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:12,760
Oh, God.

1585
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,889
Where do they go in the novel?
When they take that trip together?

1586
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:18,849
-Do you remember? Right.
-To Rome.

1587
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:29,777
A room with a view.

1588
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,279
I love these little moments.
There's no way to fake this.

1589
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:35,449
This is all just...

1590
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:38,035
It's all just self-protection.

1591
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:42,081
This was a lot of fun to shoot.

1592
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:46,126
<i>Understand I'm feeling low</i>

1593
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:51,006
I remember shooting this and thinking,

1594
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:52,925
"I hope they can get
the rights to that song."

1595
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:54,176
It's great.

1596
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,178
This is where
we're supposed to be drunk here,

1597
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:58,263
and this is the last day of shooting,

1598
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:01,892
and we all had gone out to a dinner
maybe a block from this location,

1599
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,937
and there was certainly wine
and things of that nature.

1600
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:09,984
I love the idea that

1601
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:12,820
they're fully giving themselves
to each other.

1602
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:18,409
-No, don't even wanna let him go.
-You're away from home.

1603
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:20,369
Come on.

1604
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:30,421
And the two actors in this scene here
are the leads of

1605
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:35,092
Luca's partner, Ferdinando's film.

1606
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:37,803
You are...

1607
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:39,680
That dancing she does,
it's so evocative of the period.

1608
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,473
I love it, I love it.

1609
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:48,063
Mods, or something about it.

1610
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:52,109
I was talking to someone
about this scene,

1611
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:56,071
that I look scorned here or jealous,
and that was never really my intention.

1612
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:57,531
I think it was just supposed to be more,

1613
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,493
again, just in awe of this guy
who's so unabashed,

1614
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:04,413
and less that he's gone off with a girl.

1615
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:07,708
Stumbling away.

1616
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:10,294
All right, this sequence coming up
was tough to shoot,

1617
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,463
because I already had
a mouthful of puke in there.

1618
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:14,465
And you just don't wanna reveal
to the audience

1619
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:16,133
that you already have
a mouthful of puke.

1620
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:18,552
So, it's tough.

1621
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:22,139
Trying to act like
you don't have a mouthful of stuff.

1622
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:26,393
What'd she say?

1623
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:29,646
<i>It's a new road</i>

1624
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,733
<i>I follow...</i>

1625
01:49:35,277 --> 01:49:38,864
Throwing up on camera is always hard
because there's just never enough stuff.

1626
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:40,032
No.

1627
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:42,576
Gotta go method. No, I'm kidding.

1628
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:45,329
This shot is extraordinary to me.

1629
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:48,957
-Where the light is, there's a car...
-It's just feels too good to be true.

1630
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:50,876
It's like a painting.

1631
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:52,753
This is the last shot
we did in the movie.

1632
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:55,964
This was the last scene we shot.

1633
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:06,809
This was tough to get.
We did a number of takes of this kiss,

1634
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:09,520
because it's supposed to be, you know,

1635
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:13,524
maybe the most unabashed kiss
between the lovers in the movie,

1636
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,484
but that's tough to play,
and there's no way to...

1637
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:18,987
When it's overdone,
then it becomes less real.

1638
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:24,034
So we had to do a number of them
where we weren't doing too much.

1639
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,662
You can see the film
flickering there on the left.

1640
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:28,914
And the blue...

1641
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,416
This is my favourite scene
of Armie's in this film

1642
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:36,463
because I would never know
how to play this,

1643
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,924
and he plays about 6, 000 emotions here.

1644
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:46,056
I love this, and I don't know
if Luca planned it or what,

1645
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:50,144
but that's the only place
that appears in the entire film.

1646
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:57,109
It's almost Elio's dreams or something.

1647
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,072
I love the blurriness

1648
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:05,742
throughout these scenes.

1649
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:10,497
And what's going through his mind here?
That always kills me.

1650
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:17,087
I can never tell if it's guilt
or worry about Elio, or if he's in...

1651
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:20,424
Or if he's in so much pain that
he's worried... If it's about himself.

1652
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:23,510
Did you get your passport?

1653
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,806
Not guilt, empathy for Elio.

1654
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:32,352
Well, it's like you said, 6, 000 things.

1655
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:40,569
So glad there weren't
a bunch of lines here...

1656
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:43,030
-Me, too.
-...to indicate what's going on.

1657
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:54,082
And then he starts pulling away,
and it's not time yet.

1658
01:51:55,584 --> 01:51:56,919
One more hug.

1659
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,308
You guys plan anything for this,
or is it just...

1660
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,976
No, this is how it played out.

1661
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:33,163
No time to linger.
The guy comes immediately.

1662
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,250
I love this final look.

1663
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:47,219
Yeah, doubt.

1664
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:57,771
I love it that he doesn't
open the window and extend the moment.

1665
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:59,481
And wave, right.

1666
01:53:00,732 --> 01:53:04,403
You look so young in this moment.
It's that yellow backpack. It just...

1667
01:53:08,907 --> 01:53:10,409
It's unrelenting, the train.

1668
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:19,501
I loved doing this scene.
I just know this feeling so well.

1669
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:22,629
That sense of abandonment

1670
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:28,135
-and emptiness.
-Sick, sick to your stomach.

1671
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:39,855
I love the woman in the background
in this scene.

1672
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:43,150
Again, I can't remember if she was
employed or if she was just there.

1673
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:49,281
One of those million things
that just happened, seemingly.

1674
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:50,574
Mafalda?

1675
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:52,701
Mom?

1676
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:55,245
Yeah, it's me.

1677
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,957
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

1678
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,001
in Clusone.

1679
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,003
Do you remember
if you did a lot of takes of this?

1680
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:04,296
We did two.

1681
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:08,175
Can you come get me, Mom?

1682
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,853
Amira was so generous here.

1683
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:24,691
It's always easier to do this kind of
scene when you're in it with someone.

1684
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,279
What they see.

1685
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,827
Now the lady in red is in blue.

1686
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:43,251
And at his most vulnerable, she comes.

1687
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:55,847
Was any of this improvised?

1688
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:00,102
How are you?

1689
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:01,937
Good.

1690
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,152
I read the book you bought me.

1691
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,613
The poems...

1692
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:13,240
They're really beautiful.

1693
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:16,368
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

1694
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:21,581
I'm sorry, excuse me...

1695
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:23,291
that you're sad.

1696
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:30,006
I don't remember
if her character is French in the novel?

1697
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:31,550
Italian.

1698
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,427
One of the cheats to

1699
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:37,055
-help me speak a language I can speak.
-That's wonderful.

1700
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:39,516
Hardly a cheat.

1701
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:41,226
I love you, Elio.

1702
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:47,983
Stay friends?

1703
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:52,904
This is an ode to a film
that Esther's father directed.

1704
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:57,784
It's a shot that's exactly the same.

1705
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,202
Beautiful.

1706
01:56:01,413 --> 01:56:03,457
Luca's talked about that in some Q&As.

1707
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:08,628
And I love this moment
getting out of the car here.

1708
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,173
And there's a bit of dialogue
that we did as well,

1709
01:56:11,256 --> 01:56:13,216
but we cut out of it before.

1710
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:15,886
I think the idea is established that

1711
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:21,975
the help in the house have very much
been a part of this romance.

1712
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:43,580
This shot is always... It just kills me.

1713
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:47,334
How does it communicate
how the coldness and the...

1714
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:49,878
Where love was.

1715
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:54,090
Watching you sit there earlier.

1716
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,222
That wallpaper.

1717
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:02,641
Missed you at dinner.

1718
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,893
They put all that up.

1719
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:11,358
That was in the novel.

1720
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:15,487
And Mr Perlman likes to
throw things around.

1721
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:22,911
I like the beginning to this scene

1722
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:26,706
because it's very much the lead-up to...

1723
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,250
So...

1724
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,086
Welcome home.

1725
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:32,587
Thanks.

1726
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:35,924
-Oliver enjoyed the trip?
-Yeah.

1727
01:57:36,967 --> 01:57:38,009
I think he did.

1728
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:40,845
You two had a nice friendship.

1729
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:44,307
Yeah.

1730
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:49,646
You have that shirt on, the nice
weekend shirt that you wore earlier.

1731
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:53,233
You're too smart not to know how rare,

1732
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:58,113
how special what you two had was.

1733
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:02,909
Oliver was Oliver.

1734
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:06,079
Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe.

1735
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:08,331
Because it was him.

1736
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:11,334
Because it was me.

1737
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,587
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

1738
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:16,089
He was more than intelligent.

1739
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,342
What you two had,

1740
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:24,264
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

1741
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,016
He was good.

1742
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:31,271
You're both lucky
to have found each other

1743
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:33,940
because you, too, are good...

1744
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:42,657
I think he was better than...

1745
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:46,244
I think he was better than me.

1746
01:58:49,372 --> 01:58:51,249
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1747
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,710
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1748
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:55,920
It flatters you both.

1749
01:58:59,924 --> 01:59:01,301
And when you least expect it,

1750
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:06,765
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1751
01:59:09,517 --> 01:59:13,104
Just remember, I am here.

1752
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:23,073
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1753
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:26,576
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1754
01:59:30,413 --> 01:59:33,208
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about these things

1755
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:38,421
but feel something you obviously did.

1756
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:44,844
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1757
01:59:46,554 --> 01:59:48,056
Maybe more than a friendship.

1758
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:51,059
And I envy you.

1759
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:57,565
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1760
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,652
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1761
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,656
but I am not such a parent.

1762
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:11,371
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1763
02:00:12,497 --> 02:00:14,749
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1764
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:19,504
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1765
02:00:19,587 --> 02:00:21,506
That's one of my favourite lines
in the movie.

1766
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:24,050
But to make yourself feel nothing

1767
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:26,720
so as not to feel anything.

1768
02:00:28,638 --> 02:00:29,681
What a waste.

1769
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,683
This all comes straight from the novel.

1770
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:39,232
Have I spoken out of turn?

1771
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:45,655
And I'll say one more thing,

1772
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:50,744
it'll clear the air.

1773
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:55,165
I may have come close

1774
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:58,251
but I never had what you two have.

1775
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:04,424
Something always held me back

1776
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,635
or stood in the way.

1777
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:14,726
How you live your life is your business.

1778
02:01:15,018 --> 02:01:17,562
Just remember,

1779
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:22,901
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1780
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:28,865
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1781
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,701
And as for your body,

1782
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:34,204
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1783
02:01:35,872 --> 02:01:37,540
much less wants to come near it.

1784
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:40,627
That's another one
of my favourite lines.

1785
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:47,509
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1786
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:49,385
Don't kill it,

1787
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:53,723
and with it, the joy you felt.

1788
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:07,195
Does Mom know?

1789
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:14,536
I don't think she does.

1790
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:21,668
I love that moment, whether
he's telling the truth there or not.

1791
02:02:32,011 --> 02:02:33,888
I remember feeling...

1792
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:38,893
Tremendous relief.

1793
02:02:39,227 --> 02:02:44,274
A great sense of intimacy and quiet,

1794
02:02:45,733 --> 02:02:48,736
and that it felt like an opportunity
to just talk to each other.

1795
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:49,821
Just talk.

1796
02:02:50,947 --> 02:02:52,615
This is so beautiful.

1797
02:02:53,408 --> 02:02:55,952
This almost looks like a...

1798
02:02:56,870 --> 02:03:00,039
One of those extraordinary,
I don't know, Ansel Adams.

1799
02:03:00,999 --> 02:03:05,587
Luca likes to brag about how much
it costs him to put together the shots.

1800
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:08,840
They're really beautiful,
so they were worth every penny.

1801
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:15,138
I think bragging in the how-little-spent
department is even better.

1802
02:03:15,221 --> 02:03:16,514
Even better.

1803
02:03:17,682 --> 02:03:19,809
New romantic, Elio.

1804
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:25,607
I was bummed,
those exterior shots we just saw,

1805
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:28,234
they were supposed to bring me back
to Italy for during the winter.

1806
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:29,777
I was supposed to be
walking through them,

1807
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:35,408
but then I think a certain
budgetary constraint didn't allow that.

1808
02:03:36,284 --> 02:03:38,453
So how did they capture...
What is that?

1809
02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:40,747
I think they must've put up
a green screen at the time.

1810
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:41,831
I don't remember.

1811
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:45,877
You know, it's beautiful, and there's
the Elio spin which I love.

1812
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:50,632
It looks like maybe
some eyeliner or something.

1813
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:52,008
Exactly.

1814
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,555
-That shirt. It's like a Jean Cocteau.
-Right.

1815
02:03:57,931 --> 02:03:59,140
Drawings.

1816
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:05,480
And the winter light,
you can feel it. It's so great.

1817
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:10,109
God, Michael, you're right.
I never had that thought before.

1818
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:13,488
But how did he get... I mean,
we shot this in the summer, this bit.

1819
02:04:13,571 --> 02:04:16,616
So I wonder how he got that light,
because it really does just feel cold.

1820
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:18,826
The blue, maybe they
just added it somehow.

1821
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:23,831
This scene in the study,
when we were in the background,

1822
02:04:24,165 --> 02:04:27,043
I think, initially, it was meant to be
at the very beginning of the story.

1823
02:04:27,377 --> 02:04:28,878
We put it at the end.

1824
02:04:29,754 --> 02:04:30,838
<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

1825
02:04:30,922 --> 02:04:32,423
You have your headphones on.

1826
02:04:33,174 --> 02:04:34,300
<i>Good.</i>

1827
02:04:36,052 --> 02:04:37,053
I miss you.

1828
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:39,389
The moment he's been waiting for.

1829
02:04:41,099 --> 02:04:42,141
<i>Very much.</i>

1830
02:04:46,354 --> 02:04:49,023
<i>-I have some news.</i>
-News?

1831
02:04:50,775 --> 02:04:51,776
It's from the book.

1832
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:53,444
What, you're getting married?

1833
02:04:53,945 --> 02:04:55,113
I suppose.

1834
02:04:57,490 --> 02:05:00,034
<i>I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.</i>

1835
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:05,289
You never said anything.

1836
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,585
<i>Been off and on for three years.</i>

1837
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:14,966
That's wonderful news.

1838
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:17,927
The lie.

1839
02:05:19,637 --> 02:05:21,014
Elio is a good liar.

1840
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:24,600
He has that smile frozen on his face.

1841
02:05:25,643 --> 02:05:26,811
-Oliver.
-Oliver.

1842
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:29,981
This is my favourite
Amira scene in the movie.

1843
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:33,818
Her laugh is so unabashed.

1844
02:05:36,195 --> 02:05:38,698
-And guess what? He's a she.
<i>-Oh, no.</i>

1845
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:41,492
<i>Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.</i>

1846
02:05:43,745 --> 02:05:46,956
My God, you guys play this so
beautifully, because you say,

1847
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,751
"Wonderful," and you're happy for the
boy that stayed with you this summer,

1848
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:53,504
and you support him, but you're well
aware of the implications for your son.

1849
02:05:53,588 --> 02:05:55,173
I think you guys share a look.

1850
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:56,674
Bye, sweetheart.

1851
02:05:57,842 --> 02:05:59,010
Here.

1852
02:06:04,432 --> 02:06:05,850
They know about us.

1853
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:08,478
<i>I figured.</i>

1854
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,564
How?

1855
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:13,316
We're a little closer now.

1856
02:06:13,941 --> 02:06:15,818
<i>Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.</i>

1857
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:19,155
<i>He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.</i>

1858
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:21,032
<i>Almost like a son-in-law.</i>

1859
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:24,368
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

1860
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,081
<i>My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.</i>

1861
02:06:28,164 --> 02:06:29,916
Doesn't want to hear any of it.

1862
02:06:31,292 --> 02:06:32,543
Elio.

1863
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:40,218
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1864
02:06:43,888 --> 02:06:45,389
<i>Oliver.</i>

1865
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:49,811
<i>I remember everything.</i>

1866
02:06:58,653 --> 02:06:59,946
What was that?

1867
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:08,371
-That it wasn't a dream. It was true.
-That's exactly it. That's exactly it.

1868
02:07:09,122 --> 02:07:13,042
And I like the idea here that it's...
Are we gonna end up together or not?

1869
02:07:16,087 --> 02:07:17,755
Maybe it landed a certain way.

1870
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:32,478
That's a big fireplace.

1871
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:41,779
Just so evocative.

1872
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:58,880
What do you say about this?

1873
02:08:02,633 --> 02:08:04,177
Just, I'm grateful that I had

1874
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:09,348
enough personal experiences
at a young age to be able to draw from.

1875
02:08:10,099 --> 02:08:11,809
Obviously, you don't wanna
do that all the time.

1876
02:08:11,893 --> 02:08:15,188
It could be dangerous as an actor
to pull too much from yourself,

1877
02:08:16,022 --> 02:08:20,067
but with the camera this close
and the take being as long as it is,

1878
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:23,279
it just felt like...
Anything else would ring false.

1879
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:29,368
I wonder on shots like this sometimes
because the camera doesn't move,

1880
02:08:30,536 --> 02:08:33,664
if the cameraman would, like,
not be right in front of you.

1881
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,626
What it's like to just be intimate

1882
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:38,502
in front of somebody
who's sitting right in front of you.

1883
02:08:38,586 --> 02:08:41,005
Well, yeah, I guess
the camera was just in the fireplace.

1884
02:08:41,088 --> 02:08:42,757
There wasn't anybody behind it.

1885
02:08:44,467 --> 02:08:46,135
Allowing you your privacy.

1886
02:09:01,943 --> 02:09:05,321
It was nice that Luca wasn't too
stringent about little moments like that

1887
02:09:05,404 --> 02:09:07,114
where I could kinda
break the tension a little bit.

1888
02:09:08,199 --> 02:09:12,119
I think I say something
even amidst this sequence.

1889
02:09:20,169 --> 02:09:23,089
And the great trick with this scene,
too, is maybe they CG I'd it out,

1890
02:09:23,172 --> 02:09:27,510
but in my right ear, I had a little...
A piece that was playing Sufjan's song.

1891
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:29,262
The song that's playing here.

1892
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,056
So I could kind of mirror the structure.

1893
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:36,227
It was a little bit like an
acting exercise, just to be playing...

1894
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:39,188
-Listening to music.
-Yeah, playing with what the music's

1895
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:42,275
-making you feel.
-It's wonderful.

1896
02:09:43,693 --> 02:09:46,237
Music is magic.

1897
02:09:46,696 --> 02:09:48,990
-It can make you feel...
-Absolutely.

1898
02:09:57,748 --> 02:10:01,502
And we just go along with you through
this whole thing. It's so wonderful.

1899
02:10:07,758 --> 02:10:09,552
I've never had this experience

1900
02:10:10,136 --> 02:10:12,221
of making something and then

1901
02:10:12,888 --> 02:10:17,143
getting to just enjoy seeing it over
and over and over again, honestly.

1902
02:10:17,268 --> 02:10:18,561
Honestly.

1903
02:10:26,777 --> 02:10:31,782
And I always just liked the idea at
the end of this shot that there isn't...

1904
02:10:34,535 --> 02:10:36,537
There isn't a sense of being content,

1905
02:10:37,371 --> 02:10:38,664
but there is the idea somewhere,

1906
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:41,417
that phone call, that it wasn't a dream,
all of that happened.

1907
02:10:42,251 --> 02:10:46,047
And even though it's over for now,
it's still an experience I get to keep.

1908
02:10:46,714 --> 02:10:47,840
It's almost like a secret.

1909
02:10:49,133 --> 02:10:52,219
And I see that.
We all see that in your face.

1910
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,973
Elio.

1911
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:59,060
A little homage to <i>Boyhood</i>
here at the end,

1912
02:10:59,143 --> 02:11:01,312
stealing a two-second look
into the lens.

1913
02:11:04,023 --> 02:11:06,192
Love it. I love it.

1914
02:11:13,908 --> 02:11:17,745
And that's the movie, huh?
This was a lot of fun.

1915
02:11:19,955 --> 02:11:23,125
Michael, thank you for doing that
with me, and thank you for being

1916
02:11:24,543 --> 02:11:27,129
the most amazing of scene partners
I could have had on this movie,

1917
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:29,632
-and such an amazing mentor.
-Oh, please. Thank you

1918
02:11:30,257 --> 02:11:33,177
for trusting,

1919
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:35,721
and for just being there with me.

1920
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:40,309
We did it together. I'm so grateful
to have had the opportunity.

1921
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,650
And there, of course,
"In loving memory of Bill Paxton,"

1922
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:49,819
who visited us on set
before he passed away this year.

1923
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:50,903
A lovely man.
