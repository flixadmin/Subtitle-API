1
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,630
-It's a tractor!
-Look, a tractor!

2
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,902
Don't stay here. Go over there.

3
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,005
I told you to go over there.

4
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,099
{\an8}1986, OCTOBER 23RD

5
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
Go home.

6
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,156
Go home.

7
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,991
Prick.

8
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,242
-Prick.
-I found it.

9
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,452
I found it.

10
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,828
-Look!
-What's all that?

11
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,496
-What's all that?
-I found it!

12
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,165
-Hey!
-Hey!

13
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,042
-Put that back!
-Put that back!

14
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,671
Put it down.

15
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,506
-Put it down and leave.
-It's mine.

16
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,883
-Hey!
-Hey!

17
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,718
That's important. Don't touch that!

18
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,553
That's important. Don't touch that!

19
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,680
Those pricks.

20
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,432
Those pricks.

21
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,477
You annoying pricks!

22
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,184
{\an8}See?

23
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,854
{\an8}You dated and got dumped
by the dead Park Bo-hee.

24
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,314
{\an8}Yes or no?

25
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,692
{\an8}Seems about right.

26
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,277
{\an8}Seems about right?

27
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,071
{\an8}Take that hat off, you son of a bitch.

28
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,284
{\an8}What girl would like you for that?

29
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,161
After. Watching.

30
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,999
Bo. Dy. Heat.

31
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,625
The. Film.

32
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,002
Body heat?

33
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,253
Is that an action film?

34
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,756
Ac… Act…

35
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,890
You, jackass.

36
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:13,104
{\an8}As the case concerns murder of women,
please understand my wording.

37
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,106
{\an8}For example.

38
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,150
{\an8}Sexy.

39
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,776
{\an8}Or pretty.

40
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,278
{\an8}Impressions like these?

41
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
{\an8}So first impression?

42
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,698
{\an8}Well, I guess

43
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,243
{\an8}sophisticated
despite being from the country…

44
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,121
Open your eyes.

45
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,042
{\an8}You closed your eyes.

46
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,627
{\an8}Look at me.

47
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,132
{\an8}Not the sky. Look at me!

48
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,635
{\an8}Are his eyes naturally like that?

49
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,512
{\an8}One, two.

50
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,646
{\an8}<i>…about a middle-aged woman</i>
<i>and the two children.</i>

51
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,564
<i>Their stories…</i>

52
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,982
LIM CHEOL-MIN (26)
ROBBERY, RAPE

53
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,319
{\an8}Didn't you say you were going
to the military academy?

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,195
{\an8}FAST DELIVERY

55
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,030
{\an8}Did you take the test for it?

56
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,367
{\an8}You better study hard
to go to the military academy.

57
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,953
{\an8}Receipt.

58
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,538
{\an8}You didn't tell us.

59
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,460
{\an8}Stop pulling my leg.
I told you to bring the receipt.

60
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,669
{\an8}No, you didn't.

61
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,632
{\an8}-You said that the last time so I--
-Hey, hey!

62
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,467
{\an8}Detective Park.

63
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,013
{\an8}Jackass, stop lying.
You answered the call.

64
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,267
{\an8}I need the receipt for the meal,
not the bicycle.

65
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
{\an8}Hey, the receipt!

66
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,240
Why haven't you set up the lines?

67
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,993
Use a tool, not your hands!

68
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,454
-They can't do shit.
-This way, Detective Park.

69
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,540
What's this?

70
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,457
Footprint, sir.

71
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
How'd you find it?

72
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,294
By me. I found it this morning.

73
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,213
Go help out that kid.

74
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,589
Man.

75
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,882
Called the forensics?

76
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
Yes, they'll be here momentarily.

77
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,972
You know what?
We don't have the informant at the scene.

78
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:11,931
What?

79
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,686
No forensics yet either.
The scene's a mess!

80
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,938
That gaffer.

81
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,898
-Dal-su!
-Let's go!

82
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,984
-You pricks! Go away!
-Dal-su!

83
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
Hey, get rid of the kids!

84
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,654
Come over here.

85
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,614
Who got the call?

86
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,450
You couldn't find the informant?

87
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,576
The call--

88
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,202
We can't preserve it this way.

89
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,247
Forensics aren't here either.
What a shithole.

90
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,916
-Park Seung-gyu?
-What does this even mean?

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,002
-Photos!
-What happened here?

92
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,004
Take the photos when instructed!

93
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,048
Why'd you let the reporters in?

94
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,676
They were already here when I arrived.

95
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,136
What? Man.

96
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,722
I don't see Reporter Park though.
A day off?

97
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,307
I'm not sure either.

98
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,725
Hate that dickface.

99
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,604
What a way to end my career.

100
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,440
I need a preserved scene
to begin investigating.

101
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,817
-Hey, tractor!
-Preserve it well!

102
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,862
-Hey, tractor!
-Do it well!

103
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,073
Get outta here, tractor!

104
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,785
No, not there! Tractor!

105
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,703
Hey!

106
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,166
Don't you see me waving here!

107
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,503
What you got stuck up
your fucking ear hole!

108
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,047
You dickhead! Don't you see this?

109
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,341
Assholes are finally here.

110
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,718
Tell the people there to go away!

111
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,513
I called you to come ages ago!

112
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,430
Huh?

113
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,643
I can't get shit started
until you preserve the scene!

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,395
Got honey on the field?
He fucking ate it too.

115
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,481
Seriously, what's going on here?

116
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,906
Why do you keep staring at the pictures?

117
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,741
Doesn't it kill your appetite?

118
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,117
It's sick.

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,912
If I stare at it long enough

120
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,623
I can tell who the perp is.

121
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,958
Instinctively.

122
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,795
What are you, a psychic?
Why not consider a change of career?

123
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,338
Sheesh.

124
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,634
I have a knack for seeing through people.

125
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,012
That's how I make my living

126
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:19,225
and the reason they call me
the all-seeing eye around here.

127
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,313
If that's the case,
you see those two sitting over there?

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,944
One of the two is a rapist

129
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,572
and the other
is the brother of the victim.

130
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,491
So the brother brought in

131
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,912
the perp who did his sister.

132
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,585
Now let's see

133
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,629
if you can guess which one the rapist is.

134
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,312
It's not in.

135
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,730
Really?

136
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,815
Do it properly, will you?

137
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,115
I'll personally give you
a special shot today.

138
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,491
What an honor.

139
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,204
It's only a cold shot.

140
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,290
Do you know how much this costs?

141
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,502
Gwak Seol-young.

142
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,420
Yeah?

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,132
I hear you're doing better now
than when you were at the clinic.

144
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,221
When people get sick here,
they come to you, not the doctor.

145
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,641
Wait, I have something important to say.

146
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,811
I heard it while giving a shot
to the granny at the mill.

147
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,857
You know "Baek's Meat Shop"
in Jeongsol-myeon?

148
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,942
Baek's?

149
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,613
You know what kind of a Baek he is?

150
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,406
What?

151
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,743
He's a "gonna-jump-on-ya" Baek.

152
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,412
Jump on women?

153
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,622
Exactly.

154
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,960
Well, they've got a crazy son
called Baek Gwang-ho.

155
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,175
Apparently,
he used to chase after Lee Hyang-suk.

156
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,677
Lee Hyang-suk.

157
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,261
The dead Lee Hyang-suk?

158
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:20,888
Yes.

159
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,310
The woman who died
with a girdle over her head last winter.

160
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,812
Right.

161
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,564
Even more importantly

162
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,484
the night Lee Hyang-suk got killed

163
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,155
the granny saw him stalking her.

164
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,325
She really saw it?

165
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,743
I'm telling you.

166
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,372
There're rumors
she's been loopy since last year.

167
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,332
She's perfectly fine.

168
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,882
The son. Let's see.

169
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,469
Baek Gwang-ho?
What does he look like again?

170
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:06,100
This side of his face is a bit…

171
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,477
Gimme some details.

172
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,814
Anyway, he's not all that well.

173
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,924
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

174
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,594
Just between us guys

175
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,805
When you see a pretty girl,
you get the feels and want some.

176
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,435
Believe me, I used to do that
with my friends when I was your age.

177
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,895
I feel ya.

178
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:57,109
You weren't trying to kill her
from the get-go.

179
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,113
-You probably wanted to touch her boobs--
-I couldn't.

180
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,865
That's why you killed her.

181
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,533
To touch her when she's dead.

182
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,576
No.

183
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,995
You know.

184
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,709
I grew up like you, with hardships.

185
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,169
Yet I'm a nice person.

186
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,257
A man's got a lot of affection
and can be impatient

187
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,302
which sometimes lead to these things
but it's not a fault.

188
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,387
But hitting someone with a fist--

189
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,522
You've got a hell of a face.

190
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,943
Just looking at his face makes me mad.

191
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,737
What now?

192
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,990
-Oh no.
-It's scraped.

193
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,620
This kid.

194
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,042
Purdy, huh?

195
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,255
This is so you don't get scrapes, asshole.

196
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,548
Hey.

197
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,133
Stop that with your boots.

198
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,845
You're hurting the kid.

199
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,222
Baek Gwang-ho. Get up.

200
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,643
Asshole.

201
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,603
You're really not guilty?

202
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,356
Look at me in the eyes.

203
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,316
Huh?

204
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,360
Can't tell where he's looking.

205
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,653
Look at me in the eyes!

206
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,926
If you don't turn yourself in,
your limbs will rot to death.

207
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,193
Excuse me, is there…

208
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,362
Is there--

209
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,407
Miss!

210
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,826
Are you okay?

211
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,536
What are you doing?

212
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,831
I was just trying to ask for direction.

213
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,541
-Here, let me help you up.
-Hey!

214
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,459
Hey!

215
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,129
-I'm--
-Here, get up.

216
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,632
-What are you--
-It's freaking daytime.

217
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,759
-Miss.
-Where do you think this is?

218
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,135
The Rape Kingdom?

219
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,596
Son of a bitch.

220
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,889
-Get over here.
-Hey!

221
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,186
Who the hell are you, you jackass?

222
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,021
What are you?

223
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,816
Get out here!

224
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,779
-Fuck!
-Miss, the victim needs to accompany!

225
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,240
-Hey!
-Miss!

226
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,368
-Stop!
-Bastard.

227
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,287
Hey! Fuck!

228
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,544
-Shit. She left.
-Hey!

229
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,629
Are you a cop?

230
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,593
You should've told me sooner.

231
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,470
My bad.

232
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,391
You're terrible at fighting
for being a cop.

233
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,147
You're terrible at recognizing people
for being a cop.

234
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
What's this smell?

235
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,155
Oh, sneakers.

236
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,366
Stinks, doesn't it?

237
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,495
May not look it,
but that's actually evidence no. 28.

238
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,773
Get this developed quickly.

239
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,819
Sergeant.

240
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,778
What?

241
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,321
He's from Seoul--

242
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,283
Oh, nice to see you!

243
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,701
I got the call.

244
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,163
What happened to your face?

245
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,124
Did something happen?

246
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,917
It's nothing.

247
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,835
So the desk.

248
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,503
-Sergeant, the desk?
-Oh, right.

249
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,589
I got you a seat by the window.

250
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,215
Oh there.

251
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,426
I like the corner over there.

252
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,181
Okay, sure! Whatever you want.

253
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,186
-Detective Jo, say hello.
-Yeah?

254
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:48,317
Senior officer Seo Tae-yun
from the Seoul office.

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,359
-Oh, I see.
-Yea.

256
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,361
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

257
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,115
He volunteered for this case.

258
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,743
What an extraordinary opportunity.

259
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,704
Go ahead and get settled.

260
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
Please.

261
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,584
Reality Show
<i>Inspector Sergeant</i>

262
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,808
I like that song. That theme song.

263
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,769
I need to go home
to watch <i>Inspector Sergeant.</i>

264
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,687
Which episode was tonight again?

265
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,773
Hey, eat.

266
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,567
Right, I need to call Dad.

267
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,485
I said, eat!

268
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,112
I need to call--
It's Dad!

269
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,951
Is it out? Come on.

270
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,665
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

271
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:53,048
This is the footprint taken
from the scene of death last year.

272
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,216
Take a good look.

273
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,428
And this is your sneakers from your place.
You wear them, right?

274
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,763
Yes or no?

275
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,141
Okay, look.

276
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:07,855
Look at the footprint in the picture
and the bottom of your shoes. Well?

277
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,023
Exact match, right?

278
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,817
This pattern.

279
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:17,281
Round. Sunken. Exactly the same, huh?

280
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
Yes or no?

281
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,495
That's just dirt that got wiped out

282
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,830
so no matter, right?

283
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,544
You killed all the women, right?

284
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,714
Fine.

285
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,301
You didn't kill all of them.

286
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,844
Right?

287
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,600
But you didn't not kill
Lee Hyang-suk alone.

288
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,560
Well?

289
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,312
I didn't kill anyone.

290
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,354
Hey!

291
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,900
We have all the evidence. Stop lying!

292
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,819
-Where's our shovel?
-A shovel?

293
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
You're a joke.

294
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,327
-Hey, asshole.
-Yes?

295
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,995
Lemme see that.

296
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,457
What kind of a guy
doesn't even know how to shovel?

297
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,752
You get it set up
and step on it, like this.

298
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,837
-Baek Gwang-ho.
-Yes?

299
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,798
-And then you scoop it up, like this.
-This moron.

300
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,799
-Like this.
-Whoa.

301
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,511
You think we're here to play?

302
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,931
You know what this is?

303
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,266
We're gonna bury you here.

304
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:27,851
Why?

305
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,269
You ask why?

306
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,772
'Cause you won't listen.

307
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,190
I do listen.

308
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,275
Then tell us.

309
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,612
We've got fresh air,
despite your unfortunate face.

310
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,114
Come over here.

311
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,159
Girls don't like your face, do they?

312
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,537
Shit, they frown and run away, don't they?

313
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,497
That's right.

314
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,582
I'm gonna kill them all.

315
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,214
Everyone who frowned at my face.

316
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,800
Kill them all.

317
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,887
Everyone who frowned at my face.

318
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,931
They're all in my head.

319
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,810
Was Hyang-suk one of them?

320
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,019
Hyang-suk?

321
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,020
Lee Hyang-suk.

322
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,231
You used to chase her around.

323
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,232
She's pretty.

324
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,775
Sure, she's pretty.

325
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,696
But then she frowned at your face,
didn't she?

326
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,572
She told you to get the fuck away.

327
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,075
You liked her but that fucking bitch.

328
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,827
So you killed her.

329
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,539
Right?

330
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,296
Next to the railroad.

331
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,797
In the big field.

332
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,633
Yes, that's right.

333
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,262
Neck, Hyang-suk's neck.

334
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,349
Strangled really hard.

335
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,059
Using what?

336
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,936
-The bra.
-Bra?

337
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,022
Hyang-suk's white bra.

338
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,484
Strangled the neck really hard.

339
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,402
And then?

340
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,445
Stockings.

341
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,362
Stockings.

342
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,156
Stockings taken off her.

343
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,991
-So second is stockings.
-Yes.

344
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,285
Kid's got some memory. He's smart.

345
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,287
And then?

346
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,371
What was that?

347
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,207
What's that called?

348
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,918
Like a string.

349
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,671
Handbag strap?

350
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,048
Yes, handbag strap!

351
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,676
Using that on her neck

352
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,722
to strangle really hard.

353
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:31,892
And then?

354
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:38,273
Then her body shivered

355
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,776
and it looked
like she was completely dead.

356
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,986
Then what?

357
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,784
Pulled it over Hyang-suk's head.

358
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,244
Pulled what over?

359
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,455
Her panties.

360
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:58,794
Her panties were pulled over her head,
like a hat.

361
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,005
You mean a girdle?

362
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,215
For women?

363
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,258
Yes, girdle!

364
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:10,013
-Put that on like a hat.
-Yeah.

365
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,265
And then?

366
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,143
Oh, put back on her clothes.

367
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,854
Why was that?

368
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,982
I don't know. Put it back on her.

369
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,527
Why'd you do that? Why?

370
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,784
I wouldn't know.

371
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,994
Asshole! You've been doing great!

372
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,080
You jackass, what did you do next?

373
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,832
-Running!
-Okay, to where?

374
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,625
-It was raining lots!
-Run where?

375
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,919
-Kept running!
-You asshole!

376
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,587
Where'd you run to?

377
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,756
Lots of lightning! Boom!

378
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,884
Tell us where you ran to!

379
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,804
-Yong-gu! Dig again.
-Boom!

380
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,015
-Dig? But we gotta…
-Lightning! Hot!

381
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,520
VICTIM'S HOME

382
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,274

CLOSE SHOT

384
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,207
<i>This is the civil defense alert alarm.</i>

385

<i>This is a drill.</i>
<i>The air-raid alert has been issued.</i>

386
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,546
<i>This is a drill.</i>

387
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:29,426
<i>As of current,</i>
<i>the air-raid alert is issued nation-wide.</i>

388
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,679
<i>All public and private buildings and home</i>s

389
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:37,184

<i>no light can be seen from outside</i>

390

<i>and follow the civil defense guidelines</i>
<i>provided by the defense control center.</i>

393
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,245
Turn off the lights!

394
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,373
Turn off the lights!

395
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,753
-Turn off the lights!
-Hey, go home!

396
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,838
Rice store, turn off the lights!

397
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,341
Turn off the lights!

398
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,426
YOU HIT, YOU DIE

399
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,684
-What?
-Go put on some breasts.

400
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,561
Hey, you!

401
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,772
Over here.

402
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,110
Put it on. Did you gather everyone?

403
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,904
-Yes.
-Get in the car.

404
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,863
LEE HYANG-SUK

405
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,739
Turn around.

406
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,619
Your pants. Go take those off.

407
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,456
What should the headline say?

408
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,210
How about "the three arrest-eteers"
or "the smile of the invincible trio"?

409
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,420
-Detective Park, to the back.
-Hurry!

410
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,714
First, form a row along the rail.

411
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,007
That looks good.

412
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,426
Ms. Gwon, it's a dinner party tonight!

413
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,470
Okay, here we go!

414
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,431
Okay, now with your fists!

415
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,601
-Show me your fist! Great!
-Fist?

416
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,437
-High in the air!
-Detective Seo, get in!

417
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,606
-No thanks.
-Come on!

418
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,692
Sergeant Gu, try this!

419
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,945
-Okay, take one like this.
-Great!

420
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,280
Hey, stand right there.

421
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,282
Here.

422
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:26,293
Your fingers are all stuck together.
Must be hard to use chopsticks.

423
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,962
Since you were a kid, right?

424
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,050
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

425
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,474
-Gwang-ho, it's here, right?
-Huh?

426
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,392
I don't know.

427
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,102
What you talking about?

428
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,271
-It's here!
-Hey, quiet.

429
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,899
Spot inspection is all about acting.

430
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,985
We've got a lot of eyes on us.

431
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,903
You got it?

432
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,946
How's my position?

433
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,740
Bend down more.

434
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,074
What do we do first?

435
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,827
What was it? Stockings.

436
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,912
Ideally, we should have a numbered list.

437
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,497
First, second, and so on.

438
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,958
So why didn't you make one?
I'm fucking busy.

439
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,084
Sergeant.

440
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,377
What?

441
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,172
It's too late
to have a proper spot inspection.

442
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,218
-Cancel it to save more embarrassment.
-Hey, look.

443
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,389
Didn't I tell you to stay away?
Why come all the way just to nag?

444
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,351
Come up with any excuse.
"The suspect is sick" or--

445
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,268
Detective Seo!

446
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,190
Why're you trying to ruin a done-deal?

447
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,276
I kept telling you that he's not the perp!

448
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,402
Be quiet!

449
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,363
Look, Sergeant.

450
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:41,326
The perp tied her neck thrice
and made a tight knot.

451
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,579
Have you seen his hands?
He can't tie anything with those hands!

452
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,873
-Get out.
-Even little kids know that much!

453
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,249
Get out!

454
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,671
Grab the bra and tie it.
Concentrate!

455
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:57,133
-Gwang-ho!
-It's Dad. Dad!

456
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,718
It's Dad!

457
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,136
Dad!

458
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,431
You didn't do it! You didn't kill her!

459
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,809
I know! I didn't do it!

460
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,894
Were you at the scene? Tell me!

461
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,607
He didn't kill them!

462
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,818
My son's innocent!

463
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,258
It's all over.

464
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,260
Don't say a word.

465
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,637
Hey.

466
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,641
Did you see the face
of prosecutor Choi Hong-il earlier?

467
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,437
Still, a fucking warrant dismissal?

468
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,856
We have real evidence.

469
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,275
You mean the picture of the footprint?

470
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,488
Are we really letting him loose?

471
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
What else can we do?

472
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,994
Confession alone won't do.

473
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,121
That depends on the content.

474
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,415
You heard the recording too.

475
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,502
He said details only the perp would know.

476
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,632
You know? Things only he would know.

477
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,634
Like the order in which he choked her.

478
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,679
You heard it too. In the mountain.

479
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,266
You weren't putting words in his mouth?

480
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,684
What?

481
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,728
Stop, you both. Let's eat first.

482
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,896
Seriously!

483
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,736
What's this?

484
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,655
I asked for the sauce on the side.

485
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,034
Fuck!

486
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,790

00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,512
at twelve o'clock…

497
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,308
Oh, December 16th.

498
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,977
On December 16th

499
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,145
at twelve o'lock

500
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,982
at Yangji Cafe located in Bangcheon…

501
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,025
WARRANT ISSUED
WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

502
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,610
CELEBRATORY SHOT ENDS IN SMOKE

503
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,820
…meets Han Seong-geun

504
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,614
who has an office job and is 32 years old.

505
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,619
They were on a blind date, I think?

506
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,373
So and

507
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,460
at the scene, we found one footprint

508
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,255
two bloodstains

509
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,590
one semen

510
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,591
total of--

511
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,343
Did we have semen for this?

512
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,386
Yes.

513
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,060
Were there any similarities
between the two women who died?

514
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,315
Similarities?

515
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,320
Well they were both single.

516
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,741
They were quite pretty.

517
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,035
What else?

518
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,331
It was raining on both days.

519
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,791
Rain?

520
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,085
They were killed on a rainy night.

521
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,588
Really?

522
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,340
And red clothing.

523
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,509
The dead women were wearing red.

524
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,136
Both of them?

525
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,472
Three of them.

526
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,642
Three?

527
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,977
What's he talking about?

528
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,729
There's one more woman.

529
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,481
We just haven't found her body.

530
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,737
This is a missing person report.

531
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,072
Unique name, isn't it?

532
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,366
Dokgo Hyeon-sun, 27.

533
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,076
Filed missing two months ago, July 18th.

534
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,827
Oh, her.

535
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,330
Dokgo Hyeon-sun? I know her well.

536
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,750
She's famous here.

537
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,795
She's this pretty gal from Cheongsol-myeon

538
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,881
and she's as pretty as Miss Korea.

539
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,259
They've must've filed her missing
for leaving home--

540
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,345
-Shut up.
-Yong-gu, weren't you--

541
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,515
This is more than a missing case.

542
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,684
A close look at the papers say so.

543
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,560
Papers never lie.

544
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,773
She was wearing a red blouse
at the time of missing.

545
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,608
It's obvious from the papers alone.

546
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,193
What's that?

547
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,406
The highlighted part shows the weather
on the day she went missing.

548
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,033
It was raining that evening too.

549
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,495
Red clothes on a rainy day.

550
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,290
I'm sure of it.
She was killed by the same perp.

551
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,545
You don't know anything about this town.

552
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,797
She's always talked of going to Seoul--

553
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,549
-Hey!
-She's probably already--

554
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,218
I can guess where the body would be.

555
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,761
See the map on the last page.

556
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,643
I've traced and marked her route that day
and estimated the location of crime here.

557
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
Get me two squadrons of combat police.

558
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,692
We'll have the body in two days.

559
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,654
You confident?

560
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,093
You know, college kids.

561
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,720
Yeah, what's up?

562
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:20,933
When they go on MT,
I hear the guys all get laid

563
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,021
and everyone sleeps in the same room
and have orgies.

564
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,272
Is that true?

565
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,358
I don't know. Hurry up.

566
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,363
But you have an associate degree!

567
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,325
Membership training, orientation.

568
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,078
Have you never been to one?

569
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,665
Why don't you ask Seo there
with a four-year degree

570
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,833
if they have orgies?

571
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,836
-Here.
-Fucking four-year degree.

572
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,256
I did high school for four years.

573
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,261
Like this.

574
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,596
No, not that.

575
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,931
Forget it.

576
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,561
I do miss Hyeon-sun.

577
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,063
Right?

578
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,567
-She is too pretty to rot in this town.
-Hey!

579
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,446
She's probably in Seoul--

580
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,492
-Don't run. Get out!
-What's going on?

581
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,577
-Hm.
-There're a lot of snakes there.

582
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,580
Don't touch it, jackass!

583
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,878
A body decays at a different rate
depending on location.

584
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,796
See?

585
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,590
Despite it being old,
this part's completely intact.

586
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,508
The thigh.

587
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,010
Sign of rape?

588
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,680
Some semen.

589
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,641
But the sample's too old

590
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,934
for us to get a reading.

591
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,687
Hyeon-sun…

592
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,567
Once again, he only used
items belonging to the victim.

593
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,403
True.
She was choked using her stockings, right?

594
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,737
Yes.

595
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:02,076
Putting the victim's panties
over the head is the same.

596
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,954
The way the hands are tied up
is the same, too.

597
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,749
The MO and the after-measures all line up.

598
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,419
Thorough.

599
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,337
Flawless.

600
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,467
So what you're saying

601
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,429
is that there are no eyewitnesses.

602
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,517
Some more thin skirt for you?

603
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,395
We're good on the meat.

604
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,606
Where's Gwang-ho?

605
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,191
I don't see him.

606
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,651
Is something wrong--

607
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,656
I bought something for your son
but you can give it to him later.

608
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,742
What is this?

609
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,412
I saw the shoes he was wearing earlier

610
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,248
and saw how old and smelly they were.

611
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,628
I've been wanting to get him a new pair

612
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,338
and picked up a pair of Nikes.

613
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,340
You didn't have to!

614
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,178
He's always sleeping in weird places.

615
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,764
-Hey, can we get--
-On my way!

616
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,848
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

617
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,516
This kid.

618
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,478
You're size seven, right?

619
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,147
Try on these Nikes.

620
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,110
Lemme see that.

621
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,904
-See, earlier--
-Let's see.

622
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,866
-These are Nices, not Nike.
-Nice, Nike, same thing.

623
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,786
So long as they're sturdy to wear.
Try them on!

624
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,374
If you're getting him a pair,
might as well get him the real ones.

625
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,043
They look good!

626
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,174
Have a shot.

627
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,970
Beating is all part of affection.

628
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:49,225
If you see me on the street,
don't run and say hi.

629
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,310
Yong-gu here cried after you left--

630
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,313
That kid.

631
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,989
Hey, where're you off to now?

632
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,990
That kid…

633
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,950
Sergeant.

634
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,121
He is as far as we could get
from our perp.

635
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,583
All the time we wasted on a kid like--

636
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,501
Detective Seo.

637
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,880
Why don't you eat some meat?

638
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,471
I don't eat burnt meat.

00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:13,976
What?

648
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,687
What are you doing here?

649
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,398
All the way from Seoul?

650
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,442
Well?

651
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,112
To catch the perp.

652
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,328
Is Seoul that big?

653
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,997
Is it?

654
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,001
BIgger than the US?

Give me a banana.

656
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,969
You see, in the US

657
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,058
there's a thing called the FBI.

658
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,104
Do you know how they investigate?

659
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,776
They fucking use their brains.

660
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,529
They analyze.

661
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,448
You know why?

662
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,078
Because their land is fucking massive!

663
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:21,127
So if they don't use their brains,
they can't cover all that land.

664
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,340
That's why the fucking FBI
has to be smart about things.

665
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,469
But you see, in the Republic of Korea

666
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,891
a few steps here and there,
and you've seen it all.

667
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,351
You're bound to see it all.

668
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,103
You know why?

669
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,190
The land is fucking tiny.

670
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,234
That's why they say

671
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,653
that the detectives
of the Republic of Korea

672
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,405
investigate with their two feet.

673
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,324
There's an old saying like that.

674
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,784
Jackass.

675
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,120
A smart-ass like you

676
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,205
should go to the US--

677
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,500
Damn it, stop fucking with me, fucker.

678
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,794
Fuck.

679
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,297
You son of bitch!

680
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,632
Let go. No?

681
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,550
You--

682
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,393
Give this to him.

683
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,192
Get this away now!

684
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,327
Getting that out
does help clear the head.

685
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,412
I can finally think now.

686
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,125
Things look clearer now.

687
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,335
The perp.

688
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:50,341
He's gonna strike again

689
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,052
on a wet, rainy night.

690
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,678
Therefore

691
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,681
we move one step in advance.

692
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,850
A preemptive strike.

693
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,352
Okay?

694
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,855
You bastards.

695
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:10,110
If you fight again in front of me,
I'm going to kill you both.

696
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,820
You understand?

Shut up.

What if she actually gets attacked?

713

I'm sure Seo's right behind her somewhere.

00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,931
Thanks to this,
she gets to wear a red dress.

717
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,102
With the make-up on,
she's a completely different person.

718
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,605
-So what?
-Was she always that pretty?

719
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,856
You like that?

720
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,776
-Hey, we're on an operation--
-Let's see if you got big.

721
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,735
-Wait--
-Wow!

722
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,665
Can you see from here?

723
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,752
People don't come out these days.

724
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,506
Someone's coming.

725
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,926
Hey, girls!

726
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,346
This way!

727
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,602
-Hey, watch out.
-You guys are soaked!

728
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,900
Stay here until it stops raining.

729
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,861
The umbrella is no use at all.

730
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,697
We picked this up over there.

731
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,366
Someone must've thrown it out.

732
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,411
Do you live here too, sister?

733
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,371
Hey, she's a detective.

734
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,123
You're kidding, right?

735
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,500
She's a detective in homicide.

736
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,585
-For real?
-Yes.

737
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,296
You guys can get a ride home
on our car later.

738
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,382
Whoa, we get to ride in a police car?

739
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,341
Hey, now.

740
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,260
Start getting home earlier.

741
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,470
Why are you out so late?

742
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,764
We are okay because we're always together.

743
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,268
You'd be fine even if you were alone.

744
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:36,275
Nam-ju, tell that story to the detectives.

745
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,276
What story?

746
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,195
Remember? When we were cleaning earlier?

747
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,113
Oh yeah!

748
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,116
Do you know where the killer lives?

749
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,367
I'm serious.

750
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,121
We go to Ansong Girl's Middle School
and there's a really old toilet

751
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,623
There's a crazy guy
that lives under the toilet

752
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,375
and apparently that's the guy!

753
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:57,963
He hides all day long
and comes out at night to kill the women!

754
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,425
That must mean
if the killer shows up at night

755
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:05,387
it would smell like poo
all along his path.

756
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,599
That's not it.

757
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,019
Yu-jin said some crazy woman
fell in and died.

758
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,898
I'll bring the umbrella to the plant then.

759
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,901
Uh-huh, sure.

760
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,987
Yes.

761
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,574
Okay then. I'll be right there.

Everyone stay in your position.

769
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,845
Don't move anything around you

770

You right there!
Nobody moves until forensics get here!

773
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,991
Look.

774
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,077
This is what you call a real footprint.

775
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,998
You see the concrete plant there?

776
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,502
So he grabbed her in front of the plant

777
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,714
and dragged her in silence
for almost 400m.

778
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,720
It's like seeing
a bride and a groom enter.

779
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:41,520
We really have nothing
besides the footprint?

780
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:46,775
I thought we might find his fingerprint
on the victim's umbrella, but to no avail.

781
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:52,114
The footprint's likely no good
having been faded in the rain.

782
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,160
So much
for the whole preserve-the-scene fiasco.

783
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,502
That's where I think we have the clue.

784
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,295
What do you mean?

785
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:12,009
That we have no evidence
of the perp on the scene.

786
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,472
You see, in every rape case

787
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:23,603
you're bound to find some dick hair
somewhere on the scene.

788
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,105
And?

789
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:31,570
Therefore, our perp likely
has no hair down there to begin with.

790
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,447
Like hairlessness?

791
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,532
Right, hairlessness.

792
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,242
Completely bald.

793
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,997
So he has nothing to leave at the scene

794
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,666
from the get-go.

795
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:50,881
For example, if a monk shaved down there

796
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,382
it'd be a perfect scenario.

797
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:58,555
There's a temple called Yongdeoksa nearby.

798
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,515
Should I start there?

799
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,650
-Gwi-oak.
-Yes?

800
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,736
The radio's on.

801
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,656
How would you like your coffee?

802
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
Lots of sugar for me.

803
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,620
-Detective Seo.
-Yup.

804
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,248
Got anything for us?

805
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,503
As you saw today

806
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,005
the perp is very thorough.

807
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,382
-And?
-Therefore

808
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,511
we would need to think outside the box--

809
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,430
Then what? What are you suggesting?

810
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,101
Man.

811
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,312
I have something to show you all.

812
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,360
What's she showing us today?

813
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,322
What's this?

814
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,243
I got this from the FM radio stations.

815
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,204
It looks like a list of songs played.

816
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,874
Yes. It's a hit music station
that I listen to often.

817
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,421
There's a person
who always requests "A Gloomy Letter".

818
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,008
See the dates the song was played.

819
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,389
The song wasn't very popular
so they don't play it often.

820
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,099
What's the song? What letter?

821
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,976
"A Gloomy Letter"

822
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,061
sung by Yu Jae-ha.

823
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,065
-He used to be in Jo Yong-pil's band.
-Oh yes, the drummer.

824
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,150
What about it?

825
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:40,198
The days the song was played
match the dates of the crimes here.

826
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,663
Look, October 20th.

827
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,873
Park Bo-hee.

828
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,002
December 19th.

829
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,170
Lee Hyang-suk died.

830
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:59,426
You mean this was playing
when Park Myeong-ja died yesterday?

831
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,470
Yes, I listened to it myself yesterday.

832
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,058
As the DJ played the song,
he read the request postcard.

833
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:11,897
"Sent from a lonely man in Taeryeong-eup."

834
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,065
"Please play it on a rainy night."

835
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,614
Miss Gwon, nice! Good idea!

836
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,867
Read your share of mystery novels, did ya?

837
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,370
Thank you for sharing the story.

838
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,791
This is too spot-on to be a coincidence.

839
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,877
Look at the papers. Papers never lie.

840
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,922
Here we go again.

841
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,884
Maybe our perp is a psycho

842
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:46,556
-who goes crazy when the song comes on.
-Now you too?

843
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,183
Quit the nonsense.

844
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,061
No, it does make sense. It's simple.

845
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:55,440
It's like singing the national anthem
before starting the morning assembly.

846
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,525
Did you secure the postcard?

847
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,736
I did ask for it

848
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,113
but they're really busy over there.

849
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,704
Secure the postcard and check for
fingerprint, post stamp, and handwriting.

850
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,747
Got it!

851
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,416
Detective Gwon, call the station now.

852
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,459
Now!

853
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,885
Hairlessness. What about this?

854
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,095
What about it?

855
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,389
No hair down there, as we were discussing.

856
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,348
The bald ones.

857
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,226
How're you gonna look into that?

858
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,229
Undress every man on the street?

859
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:51,788
I called to make sure
you hold onto that postcard!

860
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,498
What postcard?

861
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,834
The one you played last night!

862
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,460
We've got a ton of postcards!

863
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,006
Mister.

864
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,801
Put it on.

865
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,470
Detective.

866
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,599
They took out
the trash from yesterday already.

867
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,685
It's no use looking in there.

868
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,243
Aren't you washing?

869
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,205
I've washed enough.

870
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,002
My skin's all bloated.

871
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,422
Did you find a hairless guy?

872
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,010
Find one, my ass.

873
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,179
I ended up spending a fortune on sauna.

874
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,723
I can't even expense that shit.

875
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,726
But your face looks clear for once.
I like it.

876
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,729
You like it?

877
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,648
Pants on and off, all day long.

878
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,068
I'd be surprised
if I had any hair left by now.

879
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,744
I asked the scrubber to let me know
when he sees a hairless guy

880
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,037
and handed him my card.

881
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,750
That fucker smirked at me.

882
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,464
Don't stress all by yourself
and have the other guys work on it.

883
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,638
Seo Tae-yun.
What's that Seoul guy doing these days?

884
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,184
He's studying recent hits.

885
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,811
What?

886
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,814
There's this damn thing.

887
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,525
He's talking nonsense these days too?

888
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,777
I'm at a dead-end.

889
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,533
if you're really at a dead end,
go see a fortune teller.

890
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,285
A fortune teller?

891
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,956
Yeah, go see a good one.

892
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,669
Ask where the perp is.

893
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,255
Well?

894
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,221
It's the front gate of the police station.

895
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:18,184
You gotta move it about 10m
to the southwest, not facing the east.

896
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,856
I just saw a face.

897
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,858
It must be him.

898
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,365
AGRICULTURAL COOP

899
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,618
Is it one of these?

900
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,664
How dare you shove
these disgusting faces at me.

901
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,792
-I mean, take a look.
-Get it away.

902
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,713
You're messing with my fortune.

903
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,756
JOLLY PONG, RICE SNACK

904
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,385
Take this and do as I say.

905
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,762
Don't try to sell me the talisman.

906
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,492
Wait, hold on.

907
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,749
You mix in the dirt from the crime scene.

908
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,751
Mix it.

909
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,588
She said this was the most important part.

910
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,548
Now, pour.

911
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,721
That's good.

912
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,517
Good.

913
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,401
Once this dries

914
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:55,490
the stains will turn into the shape
of the perp's face.

915
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,450
No way. How--

916
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,536
You're bringing us bad luck!

917
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,162
Do you know how much this is?

918
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,790
You're messing with our fortune.

919
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,464
What's that?

920
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,134
You should know.

921
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,513
A perp always returns
to the scene of the crime.

922
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,465
Hold on.

923
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,927
That's…

924
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,431

Hey, come over here.

What's going on?

01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,914
It hurts.

01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,626

-What did I do?

-You! How dare you run!
-It hurts!

979
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:32,965
Get up!

980
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,014
Get out!

981
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:44,727
Come on!

982
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:58,616
I was just jerking off.

983
01:07:58,699 --> 01:07:59,784
Is that a crime?

984
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,327
No, it isn't.

985
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,413
But why'd you run if it isn't?

986
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,167
Someone jumped out from the woods.

987
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,461
It freaked me out.

988
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,965
Why not jerk off at home?

989
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,885
I have kids at home.

990
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,889
And the air's fresh in the woods.

991
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:27,228
No, you went there
to think about the woman you killed.

992
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:31,482
Excuse me.

993
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:35,986
Your husband roams around outside
at night, doesn't he?

994
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,155
What's this?

995
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,075
Lemme see.

996
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,078
Fighting for justice, Batman!

997
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,497
What'd you use to make this?

998
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,807
But you see, these days

999
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,351
the things that happen here

1000
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:10,604
are much more provocative
than those magazines.

1001
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,107
I read the articles

1002
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,360
and let my imagination run wild.

1003
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,155
I think, 'what's wrong with me?'

1004
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,574
but then again, I think, 'when else?'

1005
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,996
According to the neighbors

1006
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,999
he takes good care of his sick wife

1007
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,251
regularly attends church

1008
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,254
is diligent
and just a great person overall.

1009
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,716
All perverts are like that.

1010
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,010
Looks normal on the outside.

1011
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,304
Can't fool my eyes though.

1012
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:45,931
He's it.

1013
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:55,733
Honey, I put in extra pairs of socks
so do change frequently, after dinner--

1014
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,861
Okay, okay. Now go and feed the kids!

1015
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,405
They're protesting. You could get hurt!

1016
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,074
RELEASE BROTHER JO BYEONG-SUN

1017
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,494
No faith means hell!
Release Jo Byeong-sun!

1018
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,412
What now?

1019
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,706
I hear Jo Byeong-sun confessed overnight.

1020
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,082
Who said that?

1021
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,168
Come on, Sergeant!

1022
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,879
MAKE JUST SOCIETY

1023
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,341
When's the official report scheduled?

1024
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,759
No, I don't know anything.

1025
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,427
Be patient, won't you?

1026
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,180
You've been investigating four days
without a warrant.

1027
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,515
People are talking about
illegal imprisonment.

1028
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:33,062
This time, make it vivid like a movie.

1029
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,357
Go.

1030
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,651
You were so good before.

1031
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:40,277
Yong-gu?

1032
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,452
So you were hiding behind the toilet

1033
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:54,208
when you saw Park Myeong-ja's flashlight

1034
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,378
Yes, that sounds good.

1035
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:02,633
Yes or no? Make it clear.

1036
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,806
I think I dreamt that.

1037
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:15,104
So I approached her

1038
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:20,317
and then hit her neck with my bare hands.

1039
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,529
Bam! That must be it.

1040
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,614
-Bare hands--
-And then?

1041
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:32,204
Then Myeong-ja probably went "ow"
and then collapsed.

1042
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,916
Then I look at her

1043
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,836
and get ready to jump her…

1044
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,255
Wait, that's not it.

1045
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,094
Oh, right!
I drag her to the pine field first.

1046
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:50,347
From the rice field to the pine field

1047
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:54,560
is a whopping 200m, according to the news.

1048
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,353
That's a pretty long way.

1049
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,064
It's raining cats and dogs

1050
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,400
-and I drag her across.
-And then?

1051
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,943
-Then?
-Then

1052
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,195
I threw her on the pine field!

1053
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,157
Strangled her.

1054
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,867
Using what?

1055
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,118
Bag strap.

1056
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,077
You sure?

1057
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:13,829
Stockings.

1058
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,083
Oh, right.

1059
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,837
Bra. A Venus bra.

1060
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,009
I used that
to strangle her neck like this.

1061
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,969
Like this.

1062
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,682
That's when she picked up a stone

1063
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,936
and hit me in the face.

1064
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,358
Right here, next to the eye.

1065
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:49,656
It hurts even though it was in the dreams.

1066
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,004
Byeong-sun,
are you gonna keep saying "dream"?

1067
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,631
That's enough.

1068
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,258
Turn your face this way.

1069
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,761
That's where you got hit with the stone.

1070
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,806
-No, that's from yesterday when he--
-Shut up. Picture time.

1071
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:21,939
You've done so well until now
so let's wrap up now.

1072
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:30,239
So when I got hit in the face

1073
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:32,324
I was probably disoriented.

1074
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,244
I was lying down for a long time

1075
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,038
and when I came to my senses…

1076
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,456
Yes?

1077
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,209
…I was in the bathroom.

1078
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,585
Toilet. Shit hole.

1079
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:47,131
So then I looked around

1080
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,007
and there are maggots everywhere.

1081
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,968
He won't wrap up.

1082
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,845
So I washed it off

1083
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:56,723
and climbed up using the hay

1084
01:13:56,807 --> 01:14:00,227
and boy, was that hard even in the dream.

1085
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,856
When I got up, I saw that I wasn't home

1086
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,483
but at a school toilet.

1087
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:14,741
So I came out to the playground
and there were so many girls

1088
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,703
-and no matter what I said, the smell--
-Hey.

1089
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,169
Where'd you hear that story?

1090
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,338
Everyone knows this story.

1091
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:31,133
I saw it in my dream.

1092
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,013
From beneath the point of the accident

1093
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:39,308
stay on left and right
of the direction of the wind--

1094
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,393
Do you understand?

1095
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,978
Yes.

1096
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:46,732
-Let go. Let go!
<i>-As soon as this stage is over…</i>

1097
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:52,237
<i>-Class 2 move to the training field…</i>
<i>-</i>Okay, In-gyeong.

1098
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:58,911
<i>-Please report to the office…</i>
-That's not cool! Stop!

1099
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:05,292
You know that toilet story,
where'd you hear it?

1100
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,377
Is that why you're here?

1101
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,342
What's the matter?

1102
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,469
I got a scrape on my way down.

1103
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:17,971
Must've been a stone inside.

1104
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:20,516
Where's the nurse?

1105
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,520
Here, I'll put it on for you.

1106
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,271
I got it.

1107
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,775
Embarrassed, you kiddo?

1108
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,235
Go sit.

1109
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,281
Here, give me the band-aid.

1110
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:40,369
Show me the scrape.

1111
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,413
Remember what I asked earlier?

1112
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,915
Give it a good thought.

1113
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,295
That story of the killer
hiding under the toilet

1114
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,880
and coming out at night.

1115
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,759
Things like who came up with the story.

1116
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,886
That makes no sense.

1117
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,389
That's like asking
who came up with old jokes?

1118
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,766
Who knows who made them up?

1119
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,437
Maybe you should see the toilet yourself.

1120
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,899
Do I look like I have the time?

1121
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,202
But still.

1122
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,414
You believed the kiddy stories
and came snooping around the toilet?

1123
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,999
Don't you have better things to do?

1124
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,793
-You scared the crap outta me.
-I was investigating-

1125
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:12,711
What now?

1126
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,797
Some investigation you've got going.

1127
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:22,012
Oh, I wonder
if that's what they're talking about.

1128
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,725
I've seen it a couple of times too.

1129
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,810
-There's a woman.
-A woman?

1130
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,688
There's a weeping woman.

1131
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,066
When was that again?

1132
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,861
I was in the bathroom then too.

1133
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,031
I heard a woman crying somewhere.

1134
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,825
I looked around when I got out.

1135
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:49,581
A woman was crying,
up that field in the middle of her work.

1136
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,543
A woman crying?

1137
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,212
Yeah.

1138
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,923
She kept crying.

1139
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:00,884
It was a weird sight.

1140
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,447
Hi.

1141
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,284
Excuse me.

1142
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,580
Do you live here?

1143
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,042
Who are you?

1144
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:38,463
I want to ask you something.

1145
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:41,967
I heard that--

1146
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:43,802
Wait.

1147
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,638
Here, look.

1148
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,597
Police.

1149
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,391
Really?

1150
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,226
-Yeah--
-You can't be there.

1151
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,438
-Just a second--
-Someone might see you.

1152
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,399
No one's around.

1154
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,532
Please.

1155
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,922
We absolutely guarantee confidentiality.

1156
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,926
I'm also female
so you can be comfortable with me.

1157
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,764
Please be as specific as you can.

1158
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:35,061
That night…

1159
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,403
…was a drizzly night.

1160
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,322
When was this?

1161
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,284
It was…

1162
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,873
…last September.

1163
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,427
All the women killed so far…

1164
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,807
I read all about them in the paper.

1165
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,394
The way they were killed

1166
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,022
were exactly the same

1167
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,192
as what I experienced.

1168
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,238
The same.

1169
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,621
You remember his face, right?

1170
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,709
I kept my face down
so I wouldn't see his face.

1171
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,380
Even with the panties over my head

1172
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:46,174
I kept my eyes shut.

1173
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:51,680
If I'd seen his face,
he would've killed me.

1174
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,894
I don't know about anything else
but I do remember this.

1175
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,481
He had really soft hands.

1176
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:07,237
The hand that was covering my mouth
was pretty like that of a woman

1177
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:08,780
and soft.

1178
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:43,857
All set?

1179
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:45,817
Let's get some sleep now.

It'll be over when we stamp right here.

1182
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:52,741
Just as you testified.

1183
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,327
You like that, right?

1184
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,330
Yes, of course.

1185
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:02,083
So it's over now.

1186
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,668
Please let me down.

1187
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,920
Let me down.

1188
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,927
Let him down. He's not the perp.

1189
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:13,386
What?

1190
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,680
Hey, Jo Byeong-sun.

1191
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,848
Are you the perp?

1192
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,267
Sure, yes.

1193
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,353
Get outta here. You're not it.

1194
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,314
-I think I'm the perp--
-Let him down!

1195
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,107
What's going on?

1196
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,401
Don't leave out a word
from her statement--

1197
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,111
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1198
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,780
Having fun, are you?

1199
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,199
-You like ruining everything last minute?
-Hey.

1200
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,576
-I was so fucking close.
-You jackass!

1201
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,286
You weren't close to anything.

1202

-You bastard--
-Where do you think this is?

1203
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,917
I never liked you, fucker.

1204
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,879
-You hung Jo Byeong-sun, right?
-He kept lying.

1205
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,256
You gotta get your act straight!

I need name and address of the sender.

You must have the postcard!

-I'll go there myself.
-Okay.

1231
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,163
Sergeant, do we have the back-up force?

1232
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:05,248
They don't have any forces remaining.

All the combat police are out

Estimated time of death is last night,
between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1236
01:24:55,381 --> 01:25:00,762
So he did all this
while you two were busy fighting?

So…

1242

do you see things like this often
in Seoul?

1243
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:08,913
Never.

1244
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,335
You were right.

1245
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,295
About what?

1246
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:22,969
I was wasting my time on the wrong guys.

Hey.

1248
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,559
You got a call from the radio station.

1249

I think they found the postcard guy.

1250
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,733
I have the postcard and the address.

1251

01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,823
Where's Park Hyun-kyu? He lives here.

1257
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:30,578
He should be at the plant.

1258
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:58,439
Hey, Hyun-kyu. Park Hyun-kyu.

1259

Lemme see your hand.

1261
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,569
You've got soft hands.

1262
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,532
How long have you worked there?

1263
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:54,871
Since last September?

1264
01:28:56,998 --> 01:29:01,127
A little before the first case last year.

1265
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:09,635
So ever since you left the army
and came to the plant in this town

1266
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,930
we are getting a series of these cases.

1267
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:14,307
Isn't that right?

Yes.

1271
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,401
You've sent it many times before.

1272
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,319
Yes.

1273
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,031
You asked it to be played on a rainy day.

1274
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:31,699
Yes.

1277
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,087
No.

1278
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,758
Look at the play record. You see it?

1279
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,512
Okay, fine.

1280
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,433
They played your song yesterday.
"A Gloomy Letter" by Yu Jae-ha.

1281
01:29:59,143 --> 01:29:59,977
Yes.

1282
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,105
You listened
to the evening hit music station.

1283
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:05,233
-Yes.
-Your song was played at 7:08 p.m.

1284
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,193
The program ended at 8:00 p.m.

1285
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:08,403
-Hear the end?
-Yes.

1286
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,822
-Did you listen to it in your room?
-Yes.

1287
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,573
What was the last song they played?

1288
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,659
-I don't know.
-You should. It was yesterday!

1289
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:17,078
-I don't remember.
-'Cause you weren't home!

1290
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,413
I too was home!

1291
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,749
An Mi-seon's estimated time of death
is between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1292
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,335
You ran out while listening to the radio.

1293
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,920
You've gotta be joking.

1294
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:29,632
-Jo Yong-gu!
-Does this look like a joke, fucker?

1295
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,175
-Put him down.
-Stop it.

1296
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,264
Get behind me.

1297
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:42,186
You here.

1298
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:46,983
Even the kids know
you're torturing innocent men here.

1299
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:48,317
Shut the fuck up, you--

1300
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:49,610
Get over here!

1301
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,283
I'm not gonna fall for it.

1302
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:58,536
Not a chance.

1303
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,666
Okay, Park Hyun-kyu.

1304
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:08,087
So you listened to that program
to the end, at home.

1305
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,842
Then there's no way
you can't remember the last song.

1306
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:17,555
Because as the DJ introduced the last song

1307
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,432
he said something noteworthy.

1308
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,394
He even talked about you
who sends in a lot of postcards.

1309
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,815
If you were listening,
there's no way you don't remember.

1310
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,402
So tell me, since you heard it all.

1311
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:34,405
I don't remember.

1312
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:36,157
You don't remember?

1313
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:39,452
Shall I tell it instead then?

1314
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,625
This is a recording from last night.

1315
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,877
["A Gloomy Letter" plays]

1316
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,005
You were listening to this
on a rainy evening yesterday.

1317
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:54,592
It was pouring outside

1318
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,303
and you heard the song come on the radio.

1319
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,349
You start to get the itch.

1320
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:06,229
Because there's a thing you do
every time you hear this song.

1321
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,901
From the landlady's room,
you can hear the soap opera on TV.

1322
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:18,032
You leave the light on in the room
and slip out quietly.

1323
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:23,371
Then you walk around in the dark.

1324
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:27,333
You think, 'Who's it gonna be today?'

1325
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,211
Right?

1326
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:35,675
Then you hide in the reed field
and wait for a woman to pass by.

1327
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,344
You are soaked in the rain.

1328
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:40,972
But to you, this is all fun.

1329
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:42,223
It's fun and exciting.

1330
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,227
So yesterday, you put this
inside the woman's body.

1331
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:51,691
Do you remember how many pieces?

1332
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,444
One, two.

1333
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,364
-Three, four.
-Stop.

1334
01:32:58,447 --> 01:33:00,449
Five, six!

1335
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,951
-Seven, eight!
-Shut the fuck up!

1336
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:04,579
-You asshole!
-Jo Yong-gu!

1337
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,289
You son of a bitch!

1338
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,837
Didn't I tell you not to hit them?

1339
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,549
I told you not to him them!

1340
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:18,467
I warned you from the beginning.

1341
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,053
I warned you about the reporters!

1342
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:22,888
You moron.

1343
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:30,396
You're no longer allowed
in the interrogation room from now.

1344
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,120
This is driving me crazy.

1345
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:51,167
No eyewitness.

1346
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:54,295
No evidence.

1347
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,341
I can't do shit without anything.

1348
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:02,261
I don't need a fucking eyewitness.

1349
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:04,847
I just need him to talk.

1350
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:08,392
We can beat the crap out of him.

1351
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,189
You've changed.

1352
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:17,860
Go ahead and try.

1353
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:20,738
You'll just look stupid.
Like that time with Gwang-ho.

1354
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,702
Baek Gwang-ho.

1355
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,459
I meant to ask you this for a while.

1356
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:36,212
When we took Baek Gwang-ho to the woods.

1357
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:42,802
He said specifics about Lee Hyang-suk
in the middle of shoveling.

1358
01:34:44,136 --> 01:34:45,012
What about it?

1359
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:50,393
You sure that wasn't rehearsed?

1360
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:53,396
I told you, no.

1361
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:58,401
Then how does he know
the order in which she was strangled--

1362
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,027
My question, exactly.

1363
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:06,742
Where's the tape
with the recording from the woods?

1364
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,828
Miss Gwon. Gwi-oak.

1365
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:14,709
<i>Then her body shivered and it looked like</i>

1366
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,293
<i>she was completely dead.</i>

1367
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,170
Here, listen to the way he talks.

1368
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:22,091
<i>Pulled it over Hyang-suk's head.</i>

1369
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:24,176
<i>Pulled what over?</i>

1370
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,512
<i>Her panties.</i>

1371
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:30,725
<i>Her panties were pulled over her head,</i>
<i>like a hat.</i>

1372
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,102
He's not talking about what he did…

1373
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:34,478
<i>-And then?</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1374
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:35,438
…which means…

1375
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:36,772
<i>Put back on her clothes.</i>

1376
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:38,649
…he's talking about what he saw.

1377
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,025
<i>Why was that?</i>

1378
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:40,943
Right?

1379
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:42,278
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

1380
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,239
Baek Gwang-ho is the eyewitness.

1381
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:46,991
This way, sir.

1382
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:54,790
-Thanks for your work here. What the--
-What's up with them?

1383
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:55,708
PORK BELLY

1384
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:58,961
Where's Gwang-ho?

1385
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:00,713
Why? Did something happen to--

1386
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:04,341
-Actually, we are--
-Nothing, we came to drink.

1387
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,094
Give us some meat here.

1388
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,681
What are you doing here?

1389
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,567
Don't drink too much!

1390
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:23,778
He's not in the room.

1391
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:28,115
-I'll take a look around town.
-Check the arcade.

1392
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,786
How long have you been here?

1393
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:35,247
Have you seen Baek Gwang-ho?

1394
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,333
<i>He was one of the corrupted judges…</i>

1395
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:39,126
Them again.

1396
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:43,464
<i>--…for quasi-indecent act by force.</i>
-I wonder how he'll be prosecuted.

1397
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:45,132
<i>Here's reporter Hwang Chan-gyu.</i>

1398
01:36:45,674 --> 01:36:47,343
That bastard.

1399
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,387
<i>-At today's trial…</i>
-You call those cops?

1400
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:53,849
<i>the court decided,</i>
<i>before the inquisition, that--</i>

1401
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:57,603
You gotta chop the dicks off
those damn detectives.

1402
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:59,563
What good is that?

1403
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,608
<i>-The first hearing of the accused…</i>
-They're born ignorant.

1404
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:06,278
<i>-…began today in the Incheon court.</i>
-Be quiet. I can't hear it!

1405
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:12,868
<i>During the trial, the Prosecutor's Office</i>
<i>added act-by-force to the charges.</i>

1406
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,036
<i>I'm Han Gang-wook.</i>

1407
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:19,667
<i>During the trial,</i>
<i>District Judge Lee of Incheon</i>

<i>instructed a special--</i>

1409
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,756
-Hey!
-Nicely done!

1410
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,841
Fuck you!

1411
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:32,513
-What's wrong with you?
-If you don't like it, then don't--

1412
01:37:32,596 --> 01:37:36,183
-Fuck you!
-Bastard!

1413
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:37,726
You bastard!

1414
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:40,312
Let go!

1415
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:47,278
You did it with the professor, didn't you?

1416
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,363
Fuck you, bitch!

1417
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:53,450
Let go!

1418
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,369
Fucker! You!

1419
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,667
Call the cops!

1420
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:03,919
Let go, asshole!

1421
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:09,008
Baek Gwang-ho!

1422
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:10,509
Bastard!

1423
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:20,895
What are we gonna do?

1424
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:21,937
Let go!

1425
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,774
You idiot!

1426
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:26,692
Isn't that wood?

1427
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,904
-Gwang-ho.
-Fuck!

1428
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,406
-Gwang-ho!
-You can't leave!

1429
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,200
-No, that's not it!
-Hey, Baek Gwang-ho!

1430
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:38,704
Baek Gwang-ho! Stop right there!

1431
01:38:45,502 --> 01:38:46,337
Gwang-ho!

1432
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:51,675
-I'm sorry!
-What's the matter with you?

1433
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:55,429
-Hey!
-We're not here to get you. Come down.

1434
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:57,097
Hey, you!

1435
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,933
Are you gonna kill me?

1436
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:03,062
Let's say the thing just now
never happened.

1437
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:06,106
It could happen in any fight, right?

1438
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,735
Everything's fine, so get down here.

1439
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:13,364
You're gonna kill me, right? I know it.

1440
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:15,658
We're not killing anyone. Come down--

1441
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:18,661
Okay, you can stay there and talk.

1442
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:24,291
Let me ask you something.
Do you remember Hyang-suk?

1443
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,751
Hyang-suk who died.

1444
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,671
Hyang-suk is pretty.

1445
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:33,759
That's right.
The one you used to follow around.

1446
01:39:33,842 --> 01:39:38,639
That night, when it was pouring outside

1447
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,891
you saw her die, right?

1448
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:44,228
I already told you everything.

1449
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,521
In the woods.

1450
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:48,399
I told you when we went shoveling.

1451
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:52,486
Right. You saw her get killed, here.

1452
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:54,571
Yes, right here.

1453
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,075
Here, over the railroad.

1454
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:06,333
Did you see the face of the guy
who killed Hyang-suk?

1455
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,043
Yes.

1456
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,003
Are you sure?

1457
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,714
Lightning. Boom!

1458
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,512
I was sleeping in places like this
and saw it all.

1459
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:22,683
So you saw his face?

1460
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,435
Saw it three times.

1461
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:27,938
Do you remember his face accurately?

1462
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:30,899
He's good looking.

1463
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,861
He's better looking than me.

1464
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,660
Is this the face you saw?

1465
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:45,581
Look closely.

1466
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,218
Do you know how hot fire is?

1467
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:00,054
Take a proper look at the photo!

1468
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,973
-Fire is really hot!
-Come on!

1469
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,516
Get to your senses!

1470
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,143
Here.

1471
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:08,020
Look carefully.

1472
01:41:08,103 --> 01:41:10,647
It's hot! Hot!

1473
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,816
Look at the photo!

1474
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,403
-When I was young…
-Baek Gwang-ho.

1475
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:20,032
…that person threw me into the furnace.

1476
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:22,076
-Gwang-ho!
-You asshole!

1477
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,077
What's going on?

1478
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,828
Fuck!

1479
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:28,624
-Please let him go.
-Mr. Baek!

1480
01:41:28,707 --> 01:41:29,875
This bastard!

1481
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:32,002
Why are you doing this, Detective Park?

1482
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,505
-Fuck!
-I'm a cop!

1483
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,882
-Let go!
-Fuck!

1484
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:38,717
-Let go!
-Hey!

1485
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,469
Baek Gwang-ho, hold on!

1486
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:41,970
-Let go!
-You idiot!

1487
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:44,807
-Let go!
-Where do you think you're going?

1488
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:53,023
Hey, Gwang-ho!

1489
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:56,193
Went all over looking for you.

1490
01:41:57,402 --> 01:41:58,237
Hey.

1491
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,240
The train's coming. Get down here!

1492
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:02,950
Come on!

1493
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:08,789
Hey! Move over right now.

1494
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,334
-Hey, you!
-It's dangerous there.

1495
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:15,003
-Go!
-Let's go! You're gonna die!

1496
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,839
-Don't come. Go!
-You'll get hurt!

1497
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:19,925
-Hey!
-Go!

1498
01:42:57,754 --> 01:43:00,924
You sure it's okay to be here?
They're probably looking for you.

1499
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:38,962
Yes.

1500
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:41,340
When writing articles, reporters can be…

1501
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:43,717
SUSPECT BAEK'S MENTAL ILLNESS
WORSENED AFTER INTERROGATION

1502
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,886
As I told you the other day…

1503
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:47,554
SUSPECT PARK RELEASED AFTER THREE DAYS

1504
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:48,472
Hello?

1505
01:43:49,097 --> 01:43:49,932
Hello?

1506
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:52,100
Bastards.

1507
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:55,103
Fucking bastards.

1508
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:56,688
Sergeant!

1509
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:57,689
What!

1510
01:43:58,148 --> 01:44:01,443
It's the National Forensic Service.
They found a semen sample.

1511
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:02,903
What did you say?

1512
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:04,321
Look carefully.

1513
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,491
We found this drop of semen
on the victim's clothing.

1514
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:13,747
My guess is that it splattered
while the perpetrator was masturbating.

1515
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:14,915
-As of now--
-Hold on.

1516
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:16,250
We got that.

1517
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:19,878
If we can confirm
that the DNA print from the semen

1518
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:22,881
and the DNA print from Park Hyun-kyu

1519
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,509
actually match

1520
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:29,596
then it's game over.

1521
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,557
Yes, this is as sure an evidence
as we can get.

1522
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:39,856
The trouble is that in Korea,
we don't have the tools to analyze this.

1523
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:44,611
We need to send the semen to the US.
That's the only way for now.

1524
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:46,029
The US…

1525
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:49,658
As soon as the analysis is finished,
you'll get immediate results.

1526
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:53,453
So we just wait
for the result to get back from the US?

1527
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:54,371
Correct.

1528
01:44:55,872 --> 01:44:58,959
You got eyes on Park Hyun-kyu, right?

1529
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:02,838
Yes, around the clock, in shifts.

1530
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,091
Just you wait
for that result from the US!

1531
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:09,219
I'm gonna knock him out
with a single blow!

1532
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,405
-Hey.
-Yeah?

1533
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:29,614
What's with your leg?

1534
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,033
-Huh?
-What about my leg?

1535
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,200
Did you see a doctor?

1536
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:35,871
-I don't need to see a doctor for this.
-Lemme see.

1537
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:38,290
I rubbed on Antiphlamine already.

1538
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:43,211
-What is this?
-Remember, last time…

1539
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:45,839
It keeps swelling.

1540
01:45:45,922 --> 01:45:47,007
Let's get going.

1541
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:48,508
Let's go.

1542
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,093
PARK JONG-JU, MD

1543
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,721
Chop off his leg?

1544
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:55,640
You want me to explain it again?

1545
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:59,061
It was just a nail.
Why chop off a perfectly good leg?

1546
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:01,146
He could die.

1547
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:06,068
Tetanus is serious stuff.

1548
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:09,279
You get stabbed by a rusty nail,
you come straight to a doctor.

1549
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:11,365
You stupid morons.

1550
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,076
It's too late to change anything.

1551
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:17,120
It's not the worst of things.
We're cutting below the knee.

1552
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:20,916
Let's go.

1553
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:25,379
Family, right?

1554
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:27,798
He's got no family.
I'm a brother of sort but--

1555
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,591
But you are his guardian, right?

1556
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:32,260
This is the agreement for the operation.

1557
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:34,137
Read through and sign.

1558
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,058
NECROSIS OF FOOT BY TETANUS

1559
01:46:38,141 --> 01:46:40,435
I agree not to raise any objections
regarding the treatment.

1560
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:41,603
PATIENT FAMILY NAME

1561
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:53,365
Son of a bitch.

1562
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:10,257
Is this the post office?

1563
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:13,343
This is Seo from the Investigation Unit.

1564
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:17,389
Did the papers arrive yet from the US?

1565
01:47:20,016 --> 01:47:21,476
Did you check thoroughly?

1566
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:25,480
I keep calling because it's important.

1567
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:31,111
Anyway, it really is important
so let me know as soon as it arrives.

1568
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:32,821
Okay.

1569
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:36,199
Hello?

1570
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:41,413
Right now?

1571
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:44,499
Why would you call me out here?

1572
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,377
What, am I not allowed to call you out?

1573
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:49,921
Your face is a mess.

1574
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:52,007
Have you been sleeping?

1575
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,470
What detective sleeps regularly?

1576
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:02,350
-Why the attitude?
-Lucky bastards, just fishing away.

1577
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,940
Why'd you call me out? I'm busy.

1578
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:15,989
This is no way to live.

1579
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:21,870
I'm not the one to talk

1580
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:24,498
but can't you do something else?

1581
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,293
Can't you quit detective?

1582
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,898
HANGOVER SOUP

1583
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:09,584
Why?

1584
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:11,878
Let's go.

1585
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,269
GWANGJIN TRANSPORTATION

1586
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:50,792
Calling Homicide.

1587
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:52,502
Homicide!

1588
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,672
Where are you going so late?

1589
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:57,757
Cash is good, isn't it?

1590
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,302
PHARMACY

1591
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,512
Bo-gyeong's grandma collapsed again.

1592
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:03,722
I gotta go.

1593
01:50:03,805 --> 01:50:07,392
Why, you deserve an award.

1594
01:50:07,475 --> 01:50:09,603
The Health Department should give you one!

1595
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:20,864
Sergeant.

1596
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:23,325
He hasn't returned home in two hours.

1597
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:26,453
It's six stops from there to his place

1598
01:50:27,078 --> 01:50:29,039
so he definitely got off in the middle.

1599
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:31,750
He's been arrested once. He wouldn't dare.

1600
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,377
He would be more than happy
to mess with us!

1601
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:36,963
He was crazy to begin with.

1602
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:39,049
You look crazy right now.

1603
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:42,510
As soon as we have the DNA analysis

1604
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:44,346
that is the end of this.

1605
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:45,639
That's right.

1606
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:48,224
How could I miss him?

1607
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:50,852
Stop it! You're making me anxious!

1608
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:52,854
That son of a bitch.

1609
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:28,408
REAL ESTATE
LAND

1610

<i>A defense drill alert has been issued.</i>

1612
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:43,798
<i>As of current,</i>
<i>a nation-wide drill alert has been issued.</i>

<i>…comply with the orders…</i>

1616
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:19,834
<i>This is a drill.</i>

1617
01:53:55,578 --> 01:53:59,624
What's your stance
on the investigation this time?

1618
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,475
Stab wounds
caused by a cutter in the chest.

1619
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:21,938
Goodness, what is this?

1620
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:26,276
There's a lot of objects
stuck in the genital area.

1621
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:28,695
What is this?

1622
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:32,448
It looks like a Monami ball-point pen
and a spoon.

1623
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:35,285
What the hell is this?

1624
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:41,749
-Check the inside thoroughly.
-Okay.

1625
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,591
What's that over there?

1626
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:53,177
It looks like an old band-aid.

1627
01:55:07,692 --> 01:55:09,694
-What?
-What are you doing?

1628
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:14,157
Why are you touching the body?

1629
01:55:39,557 --> 01:55:40,516
What are you doing?

1630
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,271
Get up, you bastard!

1631
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:48,691
Fuck.

1632
01:55:53,237 --> 01:55:55,239
You fucking bastard!

1633
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,370
Get up, you bastard!

1634
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:02,455
-Come on!
-Let go!

1635
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:05,625
You call yourself a human?

1636
01:56:06,334 --> 01:56:07,752
Monster. Animal.

1637
01:56:09,462 --> 01:56:10,505
Son of a bitch!

1638
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:12,548
Bastard!

1639
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:17,679
Shit!

1640
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:20,807
Say it. I can kill you right here

1641
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:22,892
and no one would give a damn.

1642
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:34,195
Say it.

1643
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:37,323
Say you killed her.

1644
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:41,452
Say it.

1645
01:56:42,328 --> 01:56:44,956
Come on and say it alll!

1646
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:06,144
Fine.

1647
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:08,187
I did it.

1648
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,483
I killed them all.

1649
01:57:16,863 --> 01:57:18,281
Is that what you wanna hear?

1650
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:20,950
Is it?

1651
01:57:22,618 --> 01:57:24,912
Satisfied? Well?

1652
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:28,791
Hey!

1653
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,878
Detective Seo! It's here!

1654
01:57:33,087 --> 01:57:35,089
We have the paper from the US!

1655
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:36,758
Hurry and read it.

1656
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:39,385
You bastard.

1657
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:41,387
Son of a bitch.

1658
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,014
Fucker.

1659
01:57:43,097 --> 01:57:45,308
Your days of mocking us is over.

1660
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:46,851
-Hey!
-Fuck.

1661
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:52,440
Bastard mocked us.

1662
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:09,499
What's the matter?

1663
01:58:32,396 --> 01:58:34,565
{\an8}Since the DNA fingerprint
of the suspect Park Hyun Kyu

1664
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:37,401
{\an8}does not correspond exactly
to that semen sample in the victim's body

1665
01:58:37,485 --> 01:58:40,071
{\an8}it cannot be said conclusively
that the suspect is the murderer.

1666
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:43,157
Something's not right.

1667
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:55,586
This is all a lie.

1668
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:56,879
I don't need this.

1669
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:12,937
Detective Seo, what does it say?

1670
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:23,990
You're really not it?

1671
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,707
Look at me straight in the eyes.

1672
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:05,364
I said, straight in the eyes.

1673
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:21,714
Damn it. I can't tell.

1674
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:30,765
Do you even eat?

1675
02:00:35,519 --> 02:00:36,354
Go.

1676
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:40,733
Go, you son of a bitch.

1677
02:01:56,642 --> 02:01:57,643
It's time to stop.

1678
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:38,434
{\an8}2003

1679
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:39,560
{\an8}Chi-hyeok.

1680
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:43,272
{\an8}Played computer games all night?

1681
02:02:45,066 --> 02:02:45,900
Well?

1682
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:47,777
Yes or no?

1683
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:53,866
Look at me straight.

1684
02:02:55,451 --> 02:02:56,619
Bloodshot eyes.

1685
02:02:58,162 --> 02:02:59,705
Are you good at these games?

1686
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:00,623
Yeah.

1687
02:03:01,123 --> 02:03:03,709
As you should be.
Not like you are good at studying.

1688
02:03:06,337 --> 02:03:09,757
If you don't wanna study,
you should go out and work out.

1689
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,510
What's a guy doing
sitting at a computer all day long?

1690
02:03:12,593 --> 02:03:13,761
I didn't play.

1691
02:03:14,303 --> 02:03:15,471
Sure, you didn't.

1692
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:18,224
You can't fool me.

1693
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:21,769
He says he didn't. Have some faith.

1694
02:03:22,436 --> 02:03:27,525
Mr. Oh called himself the other day.

1695
02:03:28,984 --> 02:03:31,695
Always telling me, "that's no way to act."

1696
02:03:31,779 --> 02:03:32,780
How am I to act?

1697
02:03:33,697 --> 02:03:36,450
You can't just take his word for it.

1698
02:03:37,743 --> 02:03:39,745
It's all part of a strategy.

1699
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,039
Don't worry.

1700
02:03:42,998 --> 02:03:44,959
I'm on my way with the goods.

1701
02:03:45,042 --> 02:03:46,419
GREEN POWER JUICE EXTRACTOR

1702
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:47,378
Yeah.

1703
02:03:48,587 --> 02:03:49,547
Sure.

1704
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:51,382
Let's grab a meal with Mr. Oh.

1705
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:54,343
It's been a while.

1706
02:03:55,803 --> 02:03:56,637
Sure thing.

1707
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,306
-Cheol-yong.
-Yeah.

1708
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,599
Pull over for a second.

1709
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:40,032
Is there something inside?

1710
02:05:40,741 --> 02:05:41,575
Huh?

1711
02:05:42,201 --> 02:05:43,619
Is there something in there?

1712
02:05:45,204 --> 02:05:46,872
Nah.

1713
02:05:47,498 --> 02:05:48,958
Then why're you looking?

1714
02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:52,920
Just 'cause.

1715
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:55,464
That's so weird.

1716
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:58,884
What is?

1717
02:06:00,761 --> 02:06:06,141
There was another man
looking in there the other day.

1718
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,940
I asked him then too.

1719
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:15,067
Why he's looking in.

1720
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:16,860
And?

1721
02:06:18,362 --> 02:06:19,738
What was it again?

1722
02:06:20,864 --> 02:06:21,782
Oh, right.

1723
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:25,869
He said he was reminiscing
what he did here a while ago.

1724
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:28,789
It's been a really long time.

1725
02:06:29,582 --> 02:06:30,624
That's what he said.

1726
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:45,723
Did you see his face?

1727
02:06:51,478 --> 02:06:52,688
What does he look like?

1728
02:06:54,898 --> 02:06:55,816
It's just

1729
02:06:57,943 --> 02:06:58,986
a common face.

1730
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:02,573
How so?

1731
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:06,994
It's just

1732
02:07:09,663 --> 02:07:10,539
ordinary.

1733
02:10:51,635 --> 02:10:53,470
