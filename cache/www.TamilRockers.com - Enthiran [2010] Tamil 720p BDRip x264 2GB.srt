1
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:49,966
Robot, come down to earth…

2
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:08,590
Made of silicon…
Come to life with maze of wires…

3
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:12,052
With hard disk memory…

4
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,007
With an everlasting body…

5
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,848
An eternal life…

6
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,715
With integrating sixth sense…

7
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:25,383
It's an experiment…

8
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:28,848
Show us the right path…

9
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:34,173
Make humans humane…

10
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:58,841
With your endeavours,
change the world…

11
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:17,591
Be good to every life…

12
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:25,758
Be truthful always…

13
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,952
Doctor, you got a courier.

14
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,985
Keep it there.

15
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,785
Switch on the processor.

16
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,583
Good, move like that only.

17
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,398
Bloody black beetle!

18
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,318
You needed this!

19
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:39,091
He's kicking now like a fetus,
how will he kick once completed?

20
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,651
Pick it up!

21
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:34,965
Aluminium box, get me
a strong filter coffee.

22
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:37,465
No coffee to grade 2, take water.

23
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,790
How about grade 3 then junk box?

24
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,958
Humans have no respect in this lab.

25
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:19,883
Robot…robot…

26
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,026
Walk like me.

27
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:46,678
I'll start data transfer,
cut it on getting connection.

28
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:18,507
My intelligence is unlimited…
Your intelligence is vast…

29
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:22,840
I know many languages…
created a new world…

30
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:27,048
No respiration…
no heart problems…

31
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:31,492
Man is cunning…
Robot will not lose to him…

32
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:42,973
Giving pose like Bruce Lee.

33
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,798
Don't you check emails and
SMS's in your lab?

34
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,151
Where is he?

35
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,840
Why does he need
a girl friend and love?

36
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,090
Is he alive inside?

37
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,798
He's with wires inside.
He'll get angry if I disturb him.

38
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,757
Let him get angry,
tell him Sana is here.

39
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,203
Go quickly.

40
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,507
– Do you've any sister, Sana?
– No.

41
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,548
Mother?
I mean brother?

42
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,512
No, I mean cousin sister.

43
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,530
How many times I've told you
not to disturb me?

44
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,965
He's hitting with a motor, Sana.

45
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:51,632
It seems he'll not meet
even if Obama is here.

46
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,757
Did you tell him Sana is here?

47
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,548
I told him, he asked you to
call him on phone later.

48
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,132
Tell him to make pickle of his phones.

49
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,298
Tell him I'll never see him again.

50
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,482
Boys, give him speech training,
I'll come back now.

51
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,282
Hey buddy! Repeat!

52
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,173
Why are you looking like that?

53
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:35,548
Donkey, bull…
May I kick you with my dung legs?

54
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,648
Answer me, you metal head!

55
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,706
Have you given him any useful training?

56
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:44,270
– That is…have you come back so quickly?
– Tell me.

57
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,507
Hey buddy!

58
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:46,860
Repeat!

59
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:50,132
Why are you looking like that?

60
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:57,133
Donkey, bull…
May I kick you with my dung legs?

61
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:01,695
Answer me, you metal head!

62
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,382
What's this? Is this the speech
training you gave him?

63
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,293
It wasn't me, it was by Siva.

64
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,712
I wanted to start with abuses
and then move on language…

65
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,950
This is my ten year hard work.
Don't play with it.

66
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:18,936
If you teach anything like this,
I'll punish you severely.

67
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,548
Hey junk head!
Complaining about us to him.

68
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:28,028
I'll dismantle and sell you as junk.

69
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,643
Looks like it'll bite,
come let's go.

70
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:49,673
Robot…robot…though I've learnt
many languages…

71
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:53,290
My father tongue is Telugu…

72
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:57,798
Robot…robot…though won
over the world…

73
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,632
I'm a slave to my creator…

74
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:09,633
Robot, come down to earth…

75
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,325
Success doctor,
next is AIRD approval, right?

76
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:42,090
No Siva, though everything
is programmed,

77
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,632
he's an innocent machine.

78
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,340
Like an infant.

79
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:49,382
We must take him to the outside world
and let him move with other humans,

80
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:52,590
after studying how to utilize his
intelligence for the betterment of humans,

81
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:56,048
and after correcting those things,
we must take it to AIRD.

82
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,873
You want to move close with humans.

83
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,785
It'll be show!

84
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,745
Coming!

85
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,590
It's been months,
don't know what's he up to?

86
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,432
He's spoiling his health in research.

87
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,048
Hi mom!

88
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,965
What's this Vasi?
You look like a saint on leave.

89
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,257
Hi Dad! I've a shocking
surprise for you.

90
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:20,610
What's it son?

91
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:26,295
What's this?
Have you got cloned?

92
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:27,548
No dad.

93
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,423
Don't confuse us, son.
Who are you sunny?

94
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,795
He's smarter than you.

95
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,007
Dad, I've developed this robot.
Many types of robots are there.

96
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:45,295
This is Android Humanoid Robot.
A human like machine.

97
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,010
This is mother.

98
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:51,862
– Mother!
– Yes mother. Greet mother now.

99
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:56,840
It's doing just like human.

100
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:00,840
It'll do everything a human can do
and also do what humans can't.

101
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,632
Then you don't need these
useless guys.

102
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:05,132
– Father!
– No, I need them.

103
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,548
If they're not here,
who will clean robot every day,

104
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:09,340
who will make it wear
brief and socks.

105
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,673
You're making a post graduate
into a baby sitter.

106
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,360
Vasi, come to have breakfast.

107
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:19,322
Robot, you too join them.
Eat hot idlies.

108
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,957
What? I think she'll even serve him
mutton soup too.

109
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,923
It's food is just two units of
electricity every day, mom.

110
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:28,757
Why are you calling as it?
Didn't you name him?

111
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,340
Mother, select a good name for him.

112
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:34,257
If you'd a younger brother I thought
of naming him as Chittibabu.

113
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:36,923
It's nice!
We can fondly call him as Chitti.

114
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,423
Me? Chitti?

115
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:43,040
Chitti, put the TV.

116
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,382
Mother, he'll put if you
ask him to put.

117
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:56,223
You must tell him clearly
to switch on the TV.

118
00:13:57,258 --> 00:14:00,382
Vasi! Why are you leaving so early?
Back to lab?

119
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,173
No mother, I must cut hair and
meet Sana immediately,

120
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,723
she's furious on me. Get in.

121
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:07,590
– Who will drive the car?
– Chitti!

122
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:08,840
Chitti? No way!

123
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,798
No need to take such risk, doctor.

124
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,418
Aren't you also coming?

125
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,423
I think I've stomach upset.
You carry on.

126
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:14,940
You?

127
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:17,528
I didn't inform my home,
you carry on.

128
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:23,173
– Watch out doctor, he may pull out
brake instead of applying it. – Yes.

129
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:26,614
– Am I not here with him? – He broke
TV while you were here, right?

130
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,257
Don't do anything without
getting my permission.

131
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:32,030
Okay doctor.
Where should I go now?

132
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,340
Idiot! Why did you apply the brake?

133
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:49,840
You told me not to do anything
without your permission.

134
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,090
– Hey useless!
– New word!

135
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,548
Are you driving drunk?

136
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,423
No, I'm driving the car with petrol.

137
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:56,748
Don't answer him, drive the car.

138
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:06,423
Don't make it too short,
just quarter inch is enough.

139
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:09,213
I'll cut like nipping the nails, sir.

140
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:12,882
Didn't come here for quite some time?
Out of station or no time?

141
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,007
Work.

142
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,090
– Is he your brother?
– Take it as like that only.

143
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:18,465
– Sir, haircut for you?
– No need.

144
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,798
– This is wig.
– Wig?

145
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,692
– What's your age?
– One day!

146
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,125
Sir is playing truant with me.

147
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,325
Read books.

148
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,180
Is he counting the pages?

149
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,128
Do you've any other books?

150
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:50,840
Have you finished reading
all the books?

151
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,923
Finished.

152
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:54,507
You've just telephone directory to read.

153
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,985
Finished that too?

154
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,590
– Do you know all the numbers?
– I know.

155
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,943
Chiranjeevi's number?

156
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:16,923
Everyone knows it, tell my number.

157
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,248
– Your name?
– Bhajan Lal.

158
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,173
There are 12 Bhajan Lals,
tell me your initials.

159
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:27,526
К Bhajan Lal.

160
00:16:28,424 --> 00:16:30,548
There are 3 К Bhajan Lals.
Tell me your address.

161
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:34,165
N0:6, Manna Reddy street, Hyderabad.

162
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:44,590
My number is 44433321,
tell me my name.

163
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,398
Hello Mr.P Peethambaram.

164
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:02,610
What?

165
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,507
I was very busy in my lab
all these days.

166
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:10,090
Stay put in your lab,
who asked you to come here?

167
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,507
I can understand you're angry.

168
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:15,423
How many phone calls?
How many SMS's? How many Emails?

169
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,490
How many times I would've
come to you?

170
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,465
Did you speak a word with me?
I got vexed.

171
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,818
Look Sana,

172
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:26,882
one, I don't know what's happening
around me while I'm in work,

173
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:30,215
two, if you know what was
I working on all these days…

174
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,090
I've class, whatever it is come
to Gandhi park in the evening.

175
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,654
Let's meet in the evening.

176
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,382
Not to romance,
to break up our love.

177
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:42,465
Break the love?
What do you mean by it?

178
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:45,798
After our marriage, you'll spend time with
machines and I'll be left with loneliness,

179
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,757
instead of going for divorce then,
let's break up now, that's better.

180
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:52,580
Let's part ways, you take your way,
your exclusive way.

181
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:12,590
Agreement for breaking up as lovers,
the letters you wrote to me,

182
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,037
the greetings you sent me,

183
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:17,833
the book you gave me,
A Briefer History of Time.

184
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:19,277
Freakonomics!

185
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,965
See! Lord Kumaraswamy's photo
for Valentines Day.

186
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,703
Have you ever bought something
really touching?

187
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:29,968
This one?

188
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:32,465
Would anyone gift a shaving set
to his girl friend?

189
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,152
– I thought could be useful…
– My foot!

190
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:45,007
I've returned everything
you gave me. Sign this.

191
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:47,249
We don't have anything
between us hereafter.

192
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,132
– That's all?
– That's all!

193
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,423
– Have you returned all I gave you?
– Yes.

194
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:55,453
Then what about the
2 power 9, 512 kisses?

195
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:59,548
Do you keep counting the kisses too?
Won't you feel while kissing?

196
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,673
Silly matrix head!
I can't return it.

197
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,007
Break up is valid only
when you return it.

198
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,715
This is wrong rule, I'll not accept.

199
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:08,298
Then I'll not sign the agreement,
I refuse.

200
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,276
He's a pain!

201
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:14,026
Close your eyes.

202
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,507
What's this?
This is post office kiss.

203
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,382
– Did I kiss you like this?
– Then what?

204
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:29,257
Holding your waist,
hugging you tightly…

205
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,240
No way!

206
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,107
Then break up is cancelled.

207
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,173
I'll come and trouble you every day.

208
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:38,568
You're a torture!

209
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,448
Let me get rid of him today forever.

210
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,776
Come closer.

211
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,735
Close your eyes.

212
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,693
Don't smile.

213
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,690
– Is it okay?
– Too much of gap.

214
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,443
Still closer.

215
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:54,715
How many love cells
are in the body?

216
00:20:54,716 --> 00:21:01,716
How many neutrons and
electrons are in your eyes?

217
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:08,799
Just thinking about you makes
my nerves desire…

218
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:17,405
Sana…Sana…a question…
Are you the epitome of beauty?

219
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:22,382
Are you Newton's law of gravity?
Is your friendship it's effect?

220
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:27,652
Are you the smile of thousands of stars?

221
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:37,213
You're a simpleton…
But smart in asking kisses…

222
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,090
It's love for you in my heart…

223
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:50,187
There's war in the lips…
Rose petals are bleeding…

224
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:01,348
I'll come with you…

225
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:06,170
Rose flower in the clouds…

226
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:40,758
Butterflies…have the
sense of taste in legs…

227
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:50,174
Love bug bitten humans…
Taste the love with eyes…

228
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,302
Running water has more oxygen…

229
00:22:56,424 --> 00:23:01,673
Hearts that sing desire more…

230
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:04,007
My desire come…

231
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:10,215
Let's make life times love in
few moments, come my dear…

232
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:17,216
My love! Spare time for our love,
my heart is in pain…

233
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:29,008
My love! Like your thin waist,
love has grown thin like it in my work…

234
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,302
My love…

235
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,423
– Berry.
– Berry?

236
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:04,257
– Who is the driver?
– Which driver?

237
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,065
There are many drivers.

238
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,605
Who is the driver of this car?

239
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:10,750
Me!

240
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:12,965
Why did you park the car
in no parking zone?

241
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:16,548
The board says no parking only, it
doesn't say Dr.Vasikar car no parking.

242
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,958
– Are you playing with me?
– No, I'm replying you.

243
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:23,340
– Take out you driving license.
– I don't have driving license.

244
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:25,007
How can you drive without a license?

245
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,132
With driving module program.

246
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,632
Don't cook up stories,
come to the station.

247
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:29,985
Which station?

248
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,952
Making fun of me?
What is your name?

249
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:35,917
Tell me your address.

250
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:39,298
I've IP address only. 108.11.0.1

251
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,673
Why are you giving rash replies to me?

252
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,215
– What is your father's name?
– No father.

253
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:44,798
– Mother?
– No mother.

254
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,715
– Orphan?
– Not orphan too.

255
00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:47,882
How were you born then?

256
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,882
– I wasn't born, I was made.
– Made?

257
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:55,798
– Are you mad?
– No, everything is tight.

258
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,548
– Taunting me?
– No nickel.

259
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,460
Bolts are made of nickel.

260
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:02,823
– Stop it!
– What should I stop? Tell me.

261
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,757
Look…no need of argument.

262
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:14,382
Parking offense, no driving license.
You're talking too much.

263
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,740
If you go to court they'll put
a fine of Rs.1000,

264
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:20,298
will you go to the court
or settle it here only?

265
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:23,140
– I'll settle it here only.
– That's better.

266
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,693
Settle it.

267
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,485
I have.

268
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,757
Trying to irritate me?

269
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,790
Don't you know the meaning of settling?

270
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,698
Cut!

271
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:40,027
– Where should I cut?
– In my hand.

272
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:43,523
Do it fast.
Cut it fast!

273
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,757
He has cut my hand!

274
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:50,090
What happened Chitti?

275
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,898
He asked me to cut, I did it.

276
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,673
Who is it?
He's just like you.

277
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,798
Get into the car, I'll tell you.
Come on take out the car.

278
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,548
Don't go…stop…stop…police…

279
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,382
– Is he your brother? Twins?
– No.

280
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:05,882
– We'll be in trouble, drive fast.
– Is he your friend then?

281
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,090
No.

282
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:09,590
Driver? He doesn't look like that.

283
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:10,840
Wait, I'll tell you everything later.

284
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,372
Check if he's following us
or not and drive.

285
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,485
Turn!

286
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:22,173
Why are you turning head for everything?

287
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,257
You told me to see behind and drive.

288
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:27,698
– Can't you see it in the mirror?
– Can't you tell me that earlier?

289
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,485
Drive!

290
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,632
Gentlemen, he's equal
to 100 humans.

291
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,632
He has been programmed with intelligence
and talent of 100 humans.

292
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,632
He knows all the arts.

293
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,853
He knows all the languages
of this world.

294
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:42,432
His eyes are not just to see,
but to show also.

295
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,757
You can to talk to him virtually.

296
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:54,382
Such robots will help in progress
and defence of our nation,

297
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,882
you can ask if you've
any doubts with Chitti.

298
00:29:56,883 --> 00:30:02,632
Asking you a simple question,
24157817 Fibonocci number?

299
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,382
Yes 22 Fibonocci number!

300
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:09,877
By the way, that's Madhapur
Madhava Rao's phone number.

301
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:14,852
The biggest prime number you know.

302
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:23,643
М44, you may take few years
to know if it's right.

303
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,665
What Raaga is this?

304
00:30:36,674 --> 00:30:39,340
You started with Nattukurnji and
trespassed into Husseini.

305
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,693
In the middle…

306
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,962
You lost the rhythm here.

307
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,173
Is God there or not?

308
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,673
– Who is God?
– One who created all of us.

309
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:58,840
Dr.Vasikar created me.

310
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,193
God is there!

311
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,612
What a great creation!

312
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,007
– Do you know to paint, Chitti?
– I know.

313
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,402
Can you paint my picture?

314
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:53,025
Can we take a photo?

315
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,072
Look, how they're falling on him.

316
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,957
Hi girls!

317
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,213
I fixed Chitti's all motors.

318
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,298
I'm deputy scientist Ravi.

319
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,715
– Deputy scientist means?
– Helper!

320
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:14,918
– I change Chitti's dress.
– Including brief.

321
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:18,715
Why are you all after him?

322
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,715
Though he has talent of
hundred people,

323
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:24,745
he doesn't have one important
thing which we have.

324
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,923
It seems I don't have a thing
which they have, what is it?

325
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,998
– Why didn't you give that to me?
– He has complained on us.

326
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:35,090
Fools! Don't you've common sense
of what to talk to him?

327
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:37,882
No, we've feelings and he doesn't,
that's what we were to tell…

328
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,173
Don't try to change it,
cheap fellows.

329
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,878
One month salary cut.

330
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:53,548
You've told me, Chairman of AIRD.
Your Guru!

331
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,460
His photo is in our lab.

332
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,110
Your motors?

333
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,298
Can you please tell me about
your neural schema?

334
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,158
– I can't.
– Why?

335
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,715
I'm Vasikar's professor.

336
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,673
You can tell me, it's not wrong.

337
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:24,223
I'll check and tell.

338
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,132
Doctor, he's asking about
my neural schema.

339
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,485
Can I tell him?

340
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,295
You're asking know-how,

341
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:36,257
I'm hesitant to release it
till I get the patent.

342
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:39,688
Because he can be
misused very easily.

343
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:46,575
Just wanted to know how much
Chitti knows about himself.

344
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:50,173
After studying him complete,
I'll bring him to you only.

345
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:51,982
For AIRD evaluation.

346
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:06,090
Vasi, I like Chitti very much.

347
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:09,242
Can I take him to my home
for two days?

348
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,798
Is he Pomeranian or Teddy bear
to keep for two days?

349
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:17,257
No, I've my final exams, didn't study
well getting upset with you,

350
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:21,882
I feel Chitti would be
very helpful, please.

351
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:22,812
Okay, take him.

352
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,338
You both go with her.

353
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,798
Gents are not allowed in home.

354
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,400
Who said we are men?

355
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:30,305
Call me if you've any trouble.

356
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:58,298
Walk straight!

357
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:14,362
Not bun, I said gun.

358
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:30,173
I've programmed you with
8 lakh line of codes.

359
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:32,715
I'm ordering to pick up gun
and you're picking up bun.

360
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,660
Will you pluck lives
if I say pluck hair?

361
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:45,632
Vasikar is my student.
He was sensational!

362
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:50,423
The robot he created won a
standing ovation in the conference.

363
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:53,678
This is sleeping on ground
and teasing me.

364
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:56,340
I'll pluck life…

365
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:57,798
Leave my neck…leave…

366
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:04,799
Task incomplete…
pluck life…pluck life…

367
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,242
I'll congratulate you.

368
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,840
Happy Home,
what do you mean by it?

369
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,840
My father was in Army.

370
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,798
He died in Kargil war at the age of 40.

371
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,607
Sorrow, tears…

372
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:47,215
How long can we live like that?

373
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:50,965
There are so many women left as orphans
after losing husband and son.

374
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:54,715
We started this home to give them
a family of their own.

375
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,715
Nobody can change
what has happened,

376
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:59,007
nobody can stop
what is going to happen,

377
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,965
every one must be happy
this moment, that's it,

378
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,318
Happy Home!

379
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:06,923
Is the child kicking
the football well, Lata sister?

380
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,385
Let it come out,
I'll ask it to kick you.

381
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,318
Who is it?

382
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:15,798
Who is it?

383
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,465
Men inside the home, boy friend?

384
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:20,840
Not boy friend but toy friend, mother.

385
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:24,840
– It's name is Chitti, it's a robot.
– Robot?

386
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,475
– Why are you lying to me?
– She's right.

387
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,667
Don't scare people like this, fix it.

388
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,965
Mother, you'll be surprized with
the work it can do.

389
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:42,670
Can it cook?

390
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,715
Prepare something to eat,
I'll take bath.

391
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,007
Just one day and
I've lot to study.

392
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:30,207
I'll tell line by line what I've read,
if I'm wrong, correct me.

393
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:41,925
Have you finished reading all books?

394
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:45,437
I'll test you.

395
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:49,537
What are monozygotic
and dizygotic twins?

396
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:59,517
If you can by heart lessons so fast
you can become a doctor in a day.

397
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:28,028
Their trouble is increasing
with every day.

398
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:33,620
Why are you playing so loudly?
Reduce the volume.

399
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:41,132
We spent a million bucks to set up deck,
amp, woofers, surround speakers.

400
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:46,048
Do you want us to hear it in
headphones instead of full volume?

401
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:47,590
It's exam time,
so many people are studying.

402
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:49,347
There are heart patients too.

403
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:53,173
It seems heart is aching!

404
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:57,307
Use cotton stubs!
In ears!

405
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,257
Chitti, do something.

406
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:12,183
Don't worry, remote control is
infra red. I'll take care of it.

407
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,985
Close your ears!

408
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:35,690
Who is that Ammoru Talli?

409
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,965
Hi, sound is too high,
will you reduce the volume?

410
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:49,507
We are celebrating festival by offering
appeasements to Ammoru Talli,

411
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,882
and how dare you're asking us
to reduce the volume.

412
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,155
We are unable to study
for the exams.

413
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:56,173
Pray to Goddess and
put little sacred ash in mouth,

414
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:57,423
you'll pass the exams.

415
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:58,922
Reduce the volume…

416
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:06,874
Sana, no more troublesome
loud speakers. Come, let's go.

417
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:09,090
Hey brother, he broke the mike set.

418
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:10,795
Hey stop!

419
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:13,795
Bloody stop there!

420
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:36,120
Goddess mother!

421
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:43,098
Goddess mother!

422
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:50,965
What's this?

423
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,715
He's a magician.

424
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:54,833
He took away all our weapons.

425
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,192
Why are you crying Sana?

426
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:31,340
I'm sure to fail, Chitti.
I haven't read anything.

427
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:34,340
Time is over.
I feel giddy on seeing this book.

428
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:37,465
– Shall I write your exam?
– Don't talk nonsense, Chitti.

429
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:39,842
There's photo ID and exam card.

430
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:43,303
– You can't write the exam.
– We can do the Zig P.

431
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:44,776
What do you mean by it?

432
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:09,110
What are you doing here?

433
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:14,098
Sana is writing exam there.
I'm telling her the answer.

434
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,340
How can you tell her from here?

435
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:17,673
I've a built in data transmitter.

436
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:20,257
There's a trans receiver in Sana's ear,

437
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:25,090
– Is It hi-tech bit?
– Not bit byte.

438
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:27,007
Till now I've transferred 2 mb data.

439
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:30,107
Did you see how people have developed?

440
00:44:30,758 --> 00:44:31,923
Please wait.

441
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:34,132
– I'll come after the umbilical
cord is cut. – What?

442
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,530
Will you come now or
shall I call the security?

443
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:51,048
It seems you've a receiver in ear
and copying as he dictates.

444
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:52,547
– Who told you?
– Me.

445
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:54,048
I don't know who is he.

446
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:56,063
Why are you lying Sana?

447
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:02,340
He's blabbering.
I think he's gone mad, sir.

448
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:05,048
I don't have brain, just CPU only.
Perfect condition.

449
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:08,465
No doubt, he's mental.
Take him away, running out of my time.

450
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:10,507
I thought when he was talking
to himself alone,

451
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,757
may be some old medical student.

452
00:45:11,758 --> 00:45:15,007
Sir, you please go out.
Go and cut the umbilical cord.

453
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:17,048
What would you do for menstruation
and fertilization, Sana?

454
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,148
That's her problem, you go out.

455
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:04,423
If you hadn't helped me,
I would've definitely failed.

456
00:46:04,424 --> 00:46:06,800
Why are you wetting my cheek for it?

457
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:15,328
If I get caught they'll rusticate
me for three years.

458
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:18,078
That's why I had to disown you.

459
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:20,882
– Please don't feel for It.
– I don't have any feelings.

460
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:24,757
I've understood that humans tell
lies to save themselves.

461
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,151
True!

462
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:35,048
Move…move…get down…
board next compartment.

463
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:37,890
Brother, that's him.

464
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,423
Are you such a macho man?

465
00:46:43,424 --> 00:46:44,776
Come now!

466
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:48,673
What are you looking at?
You can't attract anything

467
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:50,715
we are having stones and sticks.

468
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:51,232
Come on!

469
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,750
– Why are they calling me?
– Keep quiet.

470
00:46:54,924 --> 00:46:58,798
You brought him for protection,
tell him to come now.

471
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:07,073
Chitti, my purse.
My hall ticket and ID is in it.

472
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:36,257
You ruined my home theatre, right?

473
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:39,770
Shall I ruin your home theatre now?

474
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,785
Bash up them!

475
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:29,770
You'll be shocked to know
what Chitti did today.

476
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:42,090
Had he been a human,
I would've ditched you and loved him.

477
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:47,213
– I see your face frowning.
– No.

478
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:54,865
Whatever he does,
the entire credit goes to you only.

479
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,217
My love is always yours only.

480
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:14,269
Chitti, you too join us.
Take photo of all three together.

481
00:53:16,299 --> 00:53:20,132
Boom… boom…robot…

482
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:25,402
Zoom…zoom… robot…

483
00:53:47,633 --> 00:53:51,465
Is robot Isaac Asimov's fear?

484
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:55,298
Is robot Isaac Newton's magic?

485
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:00,258
Is robot Einstein's brainchild?

486
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:34,923
Robot you've unleashed Chitti…

487
00:54:34,924 --> 00:54:38,923
Wonder of science in
this modern world…

488
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:40,840
You've mouth but no stomach…

489
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:42,590
You can talk but never breath…

490
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:44,340
You've pulse but no heart…

491
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:47,182
You've power but no arrogance…

492
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:56,173
О firestone, may you live eternally…

493
00:54:56,174 --> 00:55:00,132
You were born out of a man's love…

494
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,923
You bloomed in the desire…

495
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:08,132
You united us in love…

496
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:15,133
Before we know our marriage day,
you're our son…

497
00:55:15,758 --> 00:55:17,590
Chitti…Chitti robot…

498
00:55:17,591 --> 00:55:19,673
My buddy robot…

499
00:55:19,674 --> 00:55:24,737
You're a darling of everyone
in every nook and corner…

500
00:55:56,133 --> 00:56:00,007
Hold him.

501
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:04,368
О my dear sweet child!

502
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:10,610
Don't you've sense?

503
00:56:10,674 --> 00:56:12,715
Leave me…leave me…

504
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:19,716
Isn't there any lover like her who never
shuts mouth for little tiffs too?

505
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:26,966
He was born to do
what ever I want…

506
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:35,299
Gives boons without doing penance,
is he God?

507
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:39,965
Auto man…automatic man…

508
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:45,132
See the crowd swarming
for your autograph…

509
00:57:37,716 --> 00:57:42,798
You watching avidly as if
Shakila is dancing here.

510
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,548
Planning to complain about this too?
That's the idea.

511
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:48,372
Tomorrow is AIRD's evaluation,
I'm doing peripheral trouble shooting.

512
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,757
– Are you so great?
– Grammar mistake.

513
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:53,340
He's great grammarian.

514
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:57,132
Use he or she for humans. Only
animals and things are called as it,

515
00:57:57,133 --> 00:58:00,923
so says grammarian's thesis.

516
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:01,440
Shut up.

517
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:05,882
Forget about what he said
in a book or a TV interview,

518
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:08,632
are you greater than us
if you're better informed?

519
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,548
– Yes.
– What yes?

520
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:11,715
Can you drink like us?

521
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:13,632
Can you smoke like us?

522
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:14,840
Can you eat biryani like us?

523
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:16,757
Can you puke like us after eating?

524
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,382
Can you atleast spit?

525
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:20,548
– Can you write your initials
while pissing on wall? – Correct!

526
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:23,132
Is that all difference the
between me and man?

527
00:58:25,258 --> 00:58:27,423
– Looks like a punch in dark!
– Indeed!

528
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:30,058
These items are in
my don't eat rule list.

529
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,423
The same rule list says to obey
our orders, right?

530
00:58:32,424 --> 00:58:34,215
– Yes.
– Then, drink this.

531
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:35,590
Eat this biryani.

532
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:38,432
– I'll ask doctor.
– Doctor?

533
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:42,965
They are asking me to drink alcohol
beverages and eat biryani,

534
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:45,048
rule priority clash,
what should I do now?

535
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:46,857
Beat those rascals with slippers.

536
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:49,401
You…

537
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:52,495
Give me your slippers.

538
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,998
Slippers? Take it.

539
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:57,522
Are you going to eat it?

540
00:58:57,591 --> 00:58:58,943
He may eat!

541
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:10,090
Leave us,
all are watching us on road.

542
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:11,298
Chitti, stop it…

543
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:14,812
– Task incomplete.
– What? Incomplete?

544
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,590
Doctor…doctor…stop Chitti…

545
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:21,465
– You need it.
– No.

546
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,590
– Do you've any sense?
– No.

547
00:59:23,591 --> 00:59:25,382
I asked you to get it ready
for AIRD's evaluation,

548
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:27,090
you're asking him to drink
and eat biryani.

549
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:29,882
– We never told It, doctor.
– He's lying, doctor.

550
00:59:29,883 --> 00:59:32,413
Only humans lie, machines don't.

551
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:49,840
Human life is priceless.

552
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:53,548
Thousands of army men die is wars,

553
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,132
many families face difficulties
losing them,

554
00:59:56,133 --> 01:00:00,048
if we use robots instead of men,
there won't be any human loss,

555
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:03,298
producing Android Humanoids
like him in great numbers,

556
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,548
my aim is to present them
to Indian army.

557
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:07,173
AIRD's approval for it
is necessary.

558
01:00:07,174 --> 01:00:11,132
humbly request authorities and
scientists must evaluate Chitti,

559
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:14,387
and approve it.

560
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:19,882
Is this robot created with Asimov's
principle of not hurting humans?

561
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,798
This robot wasn't created like that.

562
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:27,482
Because robots would face situations
in war where it has to kill humans.

563
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:35,902
Reverse is possible.

564
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:42,173
Greek runner Achilles while
competing with a tortoise,

565
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:44,798
if tortoise comes little earlier,

566
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,132
it's proven theory that
tortoise has won,

567
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:48,923
– do you know about it?
– I know.

568
01:00:48,924 --> 01:00:50,340
It's a paradox.

569
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:53,132
In the process because it's
convergence is serious,

570
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:54,785
Achilles also can win.

571
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:59,197
What are you saying?
Can we approve it?

572
01:01:01,716 --> 01:01:04,257
Do you know the value of human life?

573
01:01:04,258 --> 01:01:06,173
It depends on whose life it is.

574
01:01:06,174 --> 01:01:09,173
Who will you save on
impending danger?

575
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:12,532
Dr.Einstein or a small kid?

576
01:01:23,966 --> 01:01:24,843
Turn.

577
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,401
Walk.

578
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:50,912
Stab Vasikar.

579
01:02:03,383 --> 01:02:06,715
This is dangerous machine.
It'll kill anyone.

580
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:08,730
I can't approve it.

581
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,138
No professor, you gave him a wrong
command and confused it.

582
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:17,113
It doesn't know good or bad
or friend or foe.

583
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:25,923
If we induct in army, it'll kill our
Generals instead of enemies,

584
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:27,548
letting it out in society is
also dangerous,

585
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:29,667
it has cut a traffic constable's hand,

586
01:02:30,383 --> 01:02:35,548
we've complaint about breaking
bones of passengers in a train,

587
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:41,593
this robot will suit to do only routine
programmed job in some factory,

588
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,260
Why are you angry on me, Prof.?
Why are you doing this to me?

589
01:02:54,383 --> 01:02:56,448
I don't have any grouse on you.

590
01:02:56,758 --> 01:02:59,185
Science mustn't go wrong, that's all.

591
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:17,715
What's this Chitti?
Why did you behave like this?

592
01:03:17,716 --> 01:03:21,257
What have I done wrong?
You told me to follow his orders, I did.

593
01:03:21,258 --> 01:03:22,757
If he asks to stab, will you stab me?

594
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,823
It means that, right?

595
01:03:27,591 --> 01:03:31,723
Save us…save us…

596
01:03:36,924 --> 01:03:39,257
Sir, we are unable to near
as fire is intense.

597
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:40,798
Many people are trapped inside.

598
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,007
Send additional force sir.

599
01:03:43,008 --> 01:03:45,073
Can you save them, Chitti?

600
01:03:46,424 --> 01:03:51,132
I can with stand up to 1000 degree,
I can save them.

601
01:03:51,133 --> 01:03:54,335
Not a life must go, Chitti.

602
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:09,632
Save me…

603
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:15,927
Somebody please save me.

604
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:23,077
Don't get scared, I'm Chitti, a robot,
I'm here to save you.

605
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:39,582
I would've died, he came like God
and saved me.

606
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:48,799
Somebody please save me

607
01:05:10,758 --> 01:05:13,048
Professor, watch TV.

608
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:16,173
The robot you rejected as
dangerous to humans,

609
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:19,090
is now saving humans
from a fire accident. Watch it!

610
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:21,173
Save me…save my child…

611
01:05:21,174 --> 01:05:28,174
– Save me!
– Save me…

612
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,015
Get down.

613
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:48,423
Is everyone safe? Check!
Who is it?

614
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:52,215
My daughter Gowri was taking bath,
she's missing.

615
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:56,348
I don't know what happened to her.
Save her!

616
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:31,132
Don't come near me, I'm naked.

617
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:32,423
So what? I'm also naked.

618
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:33,457
Don't come.

619
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:40,466
Leave me…leave me…

620
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:49,642
I'm naked, leave me…

621
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,807
Here's your Gowri.

622
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:57,590
– You've spoiled everything.
– Don't take pictures of me.

623
01:06:57,591 --> 01:06:59,673
The girl was naked.

624
01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:01,895
– She's alive.
– Go…

625
01:07:03,883 --> 01:07:08,048
– Don't take photos.
– I've been humiliated…

626
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:14,662
Stop…listen to me…

627
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,453
My daughter!…

628
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:33,648
What's this Vasi?
You've killed an innocent girl unjustly.

629
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:41,173
I told you it's a stupid machine.
It's dangerous to let it outside.

630
01:07:41,174 --> 01:07:46,340
You've proven now that
I was right in rejecting it.

631
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:56,757
Stupid! Don't you know to cover the
girl with cloth and bring her?

632
01:07:56,758 --> 01:08:00,840
How can it know, Vasikar?
It's not a human but Humanoid.

633
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:04,818
How can you explain honour
to a machine?

634
01:08:06,674 --> 01:08:13,340
The video of the girls suicide is shown
on TV news channels and tearing us.

635
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:18,093
There's pressure from Defence Ministry.
To stop your research.

636
01:08:18,216 --> 01:08:20,923
No professor, I can't stop.

637
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:23,423
I can make some changes in his
schema and correct him.

638
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:24,798
How can you do it?

639
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,757
It doesn't know man and woman,
it doesn't know honour and shame,

640
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:31,702
it's insensitive to human feelings.

641
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,757
I can give human feelings to it.

642
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:37,798
Only God can do it.

643
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,898
Man has made possible
many impossible things.

644
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,450
That's why I'm telling you.

645
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:50,735
10 years Professor,
my 10 year hard work.

646
01:08:50,883 --> 01:08:52,173
Isn't there any fruit to it?

647
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:55,635
There is but in a different place.

648
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:01,673
I've contacts with many robotic
companies in foreign countries,

649
01:09:01,674 --> 01:09:06,548
if you give this to them,
I can get you few million dollars.

650
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:09,673
I didn't do it for money.

651
01:09:09,674 --> 01:09:11,947
My aim is to give it to Indian army.

652
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,098
It's impossible.

653
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:19,848
It must come to me for evaluation.

654
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:23,192
Give me one last chance.

655
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:34,799
If you still fail, dismantle it.
Sell it as junk to buy dates.

656
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:39,770
Good for heart.
You need it.

657
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,507
We both are sticking with
for 5 years in this lab.

658
01:09:51,508 --> 01:09:55,548
– We got beaten with slippers.
– Find us any job in your lab.

659
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:59,062
Do you know anything about
Chitti's neural schema?

660
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:01,923
We know everything other
than that, sir.

661
01:10:01,924 --> 01:10:04,145
I'll call if I need you.

662
01:10:06,174 --> 01:10:08,240
Human feelings

663
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:12,198
Anger

664
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:14,190
Excitement

665
01:11:08,591 --> 01:11:09,840
What are you doing?

666
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,632
I'm installing software hormones to you.

667
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:14,215
Hormones are secreted only
with feelings, doctor.

668
01:11:14,216 --> 01:11:16,385
I'm going to do reverse mapping.

669
01:11:25,674 --> 01:11:30,548
Chitti, in this world human life is
a different kind of accident,

670
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:32,090
in this vast space and world,

671
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:35,840
human and life happened on
it's own by coincidence.

672
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:37,048
What do you mean by life?

673
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:39,735
It consists of DNA, the basis of life.

674
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:43,443
Is this life?

675
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:47,132
Life is not a formula.
How am I to tell you?

676
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:50,257
A bacteria has life
but sodium doesn't.

677
01:11:50,258 --> 01:11:52,840
– For me?
– For you…

678
01:11:59,841 --> 01:12:01,193
Careful…

679
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:23,410
– Do you see any changes?
– I do.

680
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:24,840
What?

681
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,165
Your beard has grown 0.5 mm.

682
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:32,757
– I asked if there's any change in you.
– No.

683
01:12:32,758 --> 01:12:36,298
Waste…utter waste…stupid!

684
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:38,383
– Vasi, calm down.
– You keep quiet Sana.

685
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:42,568
Can it understand this?
Metal head! Titanium head.

686
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,715
I haven't eaten, haven't slept.
I didn't even talk to you.

687
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:48,715
How many days?
How many days I've toiled you know?

688
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:51,048
I've taught him so many things.
How I struggled to teach him?

689
01:12:51,049 --> 01:12:52,923
He's standing there like a lamp post.

690
01:12:52,924 --> 01:12:54,276
Bloody bull!

691
01:12:56,049 --> 01:12:57,798
I'll dismantle you.

692
01:12:57,799 --> 01:13:02,548
Don't scold me unnecessarily,
I'm obeying all your orders.

693
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,382
If still I'm unable to meet
your expectations,

694
01:13:04,383 --> 01:13:06,415
the mistake is not in me,
it's with you.

695
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,840
If I'm waste then you're also waste.

696
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,715
What did you say?
Leave me. Leave me I say.

697
01:13:12,716 --> 01:13:14,782
Chitti is getting angry.

698
01:13:57,091 --> 01:14:00,215
Sana, Lata is having labour pain,
she's in serious condition,

699
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:01,568
come immediately.

700
01:14:05,216 --> 01:14:07,695
Don't worry, we've reached.

701
01:14:10,424 --> 01:14:11,776
Don't worry.

702
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:16,173
Is it very complicated, doctor?

703
01:14:16,174 --> 01:14:19,923
You're studying here, right?
Fetal cause, the head it turned.

704
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:21,465
Intestines are woven around stomach.

705
01:14:21,466 --> 01:14:25,382
Dropping pulse rate, blood loss,
she has all the complications.

706
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:28,482
It's difficult to save
one of them's life.

707
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,548
She lost her husband soon
after marriage in a war.

708
01:14:32,549 --> 01:14:37,048
She's living for this child only.
Please save both of them.

709
01:14:37,049 --> 01:14:41,853
– I can only try, beyond that…
– Can I try?

710
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:46,257
– Who are you? Doctor?
– No, I'm Chitti, a robot.

711
01:14:46,258 --> 01:14:48,340
– Robot?
– Can you do it, Chitti?

712
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:48,857
Why not?

713
01:14:48,966 --> 01:14:53,423
Sorry, we can't allow it.
This is not a lab but labour ward.

714
01:14:53,424 --> 01:14:55,215
Two lives are under total risk.

715
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:57,882
With so much experience
this is a nightmare to us.

716
01:14:57,883 --> 01:15:01,132
I can do it, I've studied
for Sana's exams.

717
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:02,590
Sana herself can't do it.

718
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:05,897
You need qualification and
experience to a Ceasarian.

719
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:11,182
No need of ceasarian,
I'll have it a normal delivery.

720
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,019
How is it possible?
Both will die.

721
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:14,882
We can do plasma transfusion.

722
01:15:14,883 --> 01:15:17,757
Blood pressure is high.
She may get fits at any moment.

723
01:15:17,758 --> 01:15:19,110
Can give maxil pressure.

724
01:15:20,299 --> 01:15:22,048
Normal delivery is impossible.

725
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:26,173
Possible, can do symphiostemy.
Olden times delivery method.

726
01:15:26,174 --> 01:15:28,602
Pushing through after
stretching pelvic bone.

727
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:51,081
Don't shout, your son is
getting scared.

728
01:15:57,466 --> 01:15:59,548
First time a robot is acting
as midwife to deliver a child.

729
01:15:59,549 --> 01:16:02,235
Your son is just like you.

730
01:16:03,383 --> 01:16:04,828
Do you want to see?

731
01:16:06,299 --> 01:16:08,673
Doctor, switch on Wi-Fi.

732
01:16:08,674 --> 01:16:10,843
I'll stream ultrasound video.

733
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,215
It's a milestone in robotics.

734
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:41,057
It's an achievement in
artificial intelligence.

735
01:16:55,966 --> 01:17:02,966
– Just 95 seconds only, stay awake.
– Sister, open your eyes and see.

736
01:17:04,424 --> 01:17:08,970
He'll take birth at exactly
4hrs 44mts 44 secs.

737
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:20,375
It's over! Just 55 seconds more only!

738
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:26,657
Just 35 seconds only!

739
01:17:32,341 --> 01:17:35,440
Sister…sister…

740
01:17:40,299 --> 01:17:41,651
Sister…

741
01:18:11,799 --> 01:18:13,658
Will you approve Chitti now?

742
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:15,922
Definitely.

743
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:20,823
But the real problem for you starts now.

744
01:18:54,299 --> 01:18:56,933
The real story begins now.

745
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:20,865
I'm extremely happy today.

746
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,752
Get charge in sleeping mode.

747
01:20:18,341 --> 01:20:20,132
What are you doing here at this hour?

748
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:22,923
– A mosquito was biting your cheek.
– Did you come here to kill it?

749
01:20:22,924 --> 01:20:26,465
No, I felt like seeing you,
that's why I'm here.

750
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:28,757
What's this new habit?
Go away.

751
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:32,840
Your kiss today was very good.
Give me another one. I'll go.

752
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:36,882
What happened to you?
Disturbing me at 1 am, go away.

753
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:40,548
– Kiss me, I'll go away.
– Why are you troubling me?

754
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,340
You achieved something great,
I kissed you.

755
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,257
Is there anyone else pregnant in Home?

756
01:20:44,258 --> 01:20:45,965
Is this maternity ward?

757
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,393
What do you want me to achieve now?
Tell me.

758
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:52,168
Catch the mosquito that bit me now.

759
01:20:52,716 --> 01:20:54,068
That's all?

760
01:21:24,341 --> 01:21:26,820
Who bit Sana in Happy Home?

761
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:29,600
Not me. I was in drains.

762
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:31,257
I'm Malakpet mosquito.

763
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:34,124
– Rangooski is from Kukatpalli.
– Who is this Rangooski?

764
01:21:34,383 --> 01:21:36,810
– Me!
– Did you bite Sana?

765
01:21:36,966 --> 01:21:39,465
Yes I did. So what?

766
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:41,798
I've bitten Andhra Pradesh
Chief Minister also.

767
01:21:41,799 --> 01:21:43,340
Come with me and
seek her forgiveness.

768
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:44,693
Seek forgiveness?

769
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:48,007
– Fulfill my 3 wishes, I'll think.
– Tell me your wishes.

770
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:51,158
Number one,
I want AB negative blood,

771
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:54,048
very difficult to get.

772
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:57,882
Siva and Ravi in my lab belong to
that group. They always belittle me.

773
01:21:57,883 --> 01:21:59,499
Suck as much blood as you want.

774
01:22:01,758 --> 01:22:06,632
Number two, ban all the companies
manufacturing mosquito repellents.

775
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,298
They are disturbing us a lot.

776
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:11,215
– Third wish?
– Announce us as National Bird.

777
01:22:11,216 --> 01:22:13,965
Fool, you're not a bird.
You're an insect.

778
01:22:13,966 --> 01:22:16,048
Getting late, will you come
with me or not?

779
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:17,082
I'll not come.

780
01:22:17,091 --> 01:22:20,215
If you don't come now,
I'll exterminate all of you.

781
01:22:20,216 --> 01:22:24,798
Hey who is it? How dare you enter
our area and threaten to kill us!

782
01:22:24,799 --> 01:22:26,673
Have men become so brave?

783
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:31,632
How many we'd killed with malaria,
dengue and chikungunea, forgotten it?

784
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:32,673
Let's show him our power!

785
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,090
– Hey Dengue Lakshmi!
– Sister!

786
01:22:34,091 --> 01:22:35,173
– Hey Cholera Jasmine.
– Sister.

787
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:37,240
– Attack him!
– Okay sister.

788
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:43,507
Sister, he's very strong.

789
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:46,340
Cholera Jasmine broke it's sting
biting him.

790
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:47,382
Is it?

791
01:22:47,383 --> 01:22:51,102
– Enter his mouth at right moment.
– Okay sister.

792
01:22:56,549 --> 01:22:59,545
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi died
getting electrocuted.

793
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:04,048
I think this is something
new like electric mat.

794
01:23:04,049 --> 01:23:07,465
Let's back off like when we
faced the first repellents,

795
01:23:07,466 --> 01:23:09,687
later on we can come back
and have a ball.

796
01:23:10,924 --> 01:23:13,093
You can take Rangooski with you.

797
01:23:19,049 --> 01:23:21,632
Look Sana, the mosquito
which bit you.

798
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:25,662
Rangooski.
Rangooski, say sorry to Sana.

799
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:31,413
Never again dare come near Sana,
warn your people.

800
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,026
Go!

801
01:23:35,258 --> 01:23:36,962
Kiss me now.

802
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:56,590
Is heart sprouting in iron
for the first time?

803
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,878
It's asking you to kiss…

804
01:25:07,424 --> 01:25:11,173
Machine with prayer…
It has come for fragrance of flower…

805
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:14,923
Robot is a wonder…
today has become a lover boy…

806
01:25:14,924 --> 01:25:18,507
He wants to see this world beauty…

807
01:25:18,508 --> 01:25:22,950
A love which time hasn't seen till now,
I love you, my maiden…

808
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:28,605
I robot, shall I tell I love you
in your ears?

809
01:25:31,466 --> 01:25:35,960
I'm a super girl,
your love rapper girl…

810
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:43,273
The beauty of moonlit night
is all yours…

811
01:25:44,424 --> 01:25:48,048
I'll steal the current from
your blue eyes…

812
01:25:48,049 --> 01:25:51,798
I'll join your laugh with
my blue tooth…

813
01:25:51,799 --> 01:25:55,340
I'll dedicate my engine heart
at your service…

814
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:59,173
While you're asleep,
I'll hug you…

815
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:03,462
I'm always a toy in your hands…

816
01:26:06,383 --> 01:26:11,798
When talking to me I may get
electrocuted with your touch…

817
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,590
While romancing me,
your motor speed may race…

818
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:18,103
Battery may get low at midnight…

819
01:26:32,174 --> 01:26:35,923
I've arrested you in my memory…

820
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:41,340
I spent night eagerly without
shutting it down…

821
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:45,340
Gathered all the sensors…
Read you always…

822
01:26:45,341 --> 01:26:49,990
I've forgotten about my duties
because of you only…

823
01:26:50,549 --> 01:26:54,298
Will you accept my dry kiss
without any inhibition?

824
01:26:54,299 --> 01:26:58,048
Will you refuse this bloodless love?

825
01:26:58,049 --> 01:27:05,049
In Zoology I'm a machine…
In Astronomy, I'm a moon…

826
01:27:05,341 --> 01:27:09,257
I've come to earth with
the boon of deathless life…

827
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:14,165
I'm blessed with never
diminishing love…

828
01:27:14,591 --> 01:27:21,307
Hey Robot! Don't try to charm me…

829
01:27:41,383 --> 01:27:44,173
Don't touch me, move aside…
Don't shackle me…

830
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:48,772
Love seeking Robot,
I don't want you, go away…

831
01:29:22,383 --> 01:29:25,465
– Mr.Birminger, arms dealer
– Agent Shah

832
01:29:25,466 --> 01:29:32,466
Many terror organisations want to use robots for
destruction, suicide missions instead of men.

833
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:39,860
They are ready to pay any price,
they've clients all over the world.

834
01:29:41,424 --> 01:29:43,335
He wants to see your model.

835
01:30:14,424 --> 01:30:17,265
He wants 100 robots, March delivery.

836
01:30:19,633 --> 01:30:21,078
Your advance.

837
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:30,673
What happened to my robots?

838
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:33,825
It's almost ready, Mr.Birminger.

839
01:30:35,258 --> 01:30:37,257
You should've delivered by now
as per the contract.

840
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:39,007
You're still showing the skeletons.

841
01:30:39,008 --> 01:30:41,590
Intense testing is on.

842
01:30:41,591 --> 01:30:44,380
I'm fine tuning it to zero defect.

843
01:31:13,966 --> 01:31:15,515
Gift pack this.

844
01:31:16,216 --> 01:31:19,005
– For whom?
– It's Sana's birthday today.

845
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:23,382
Gift pack this one too.

846
01:31:23,383 --> 01:31:25,257
Wait…wait…why that one too?

847
01:31:25,258 --> 01:31:26,507
I'll also present a gift to Sana.

848
01:31:26,508 --> 01:31:28,590
– I'm giving it, right?
– I'll also give one.

849
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:30,673
– Who will pay for it?
– You pay.

850
01:31:30,674 --> 01:31:34,032
– Why?
– Salary for my work.

851
01:31:34,883 --> 01:31:37,007
We don't pay salaries to machines.

852
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:38,590
Are we paying salary to car and fridge?

853
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:39,943
I'm not a machine.

854
01:31:40,674 --> 01:31:42,340
If you don't pay salary,
I'll strike work.

855
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:45,423
I'll take a vow of fasting
by not charging for a week.

856
01:31:45,424 --> 01:31:47,665
Looks like you'll ask for
a credit card too.

857
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:50,965
No need, I've your credit card number.

858
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:52,722
I can sign like you.

859
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,493
You're killing me.

860
01:31:54,799 --> 01:31:56,151
Pack both.

861
01:32:37,924 --> 01:32:40,298
– Who will drive the car?
– You!

862
01:32:40,299 --> 01:32:42,107
I'm on leave today.

863
01:32:43,549 --> 01:32:44,901
My bad time!

864
01:32:52,966 --> 01:32:57,923
50 kg Taj Mahal is all mine…

865
01:32:57,924 --> 01:32:59,887
Watch the road and drive.

866
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:21,297
With today it's 200 thousand hours
you've been on earth.

867
01:33:25,258 --> 01:33:28,047
Chitti, you're giving gift…

868
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:37,227
Mother, help me.

869
01:33:41,924 --> 01:33:43,473
How is it Vasi?

870
01:33:44,799 --> 01:33:46,151
Isn't it nice?

871
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:50,208
I too have given you
a similar necklace.

872
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:52,800
Anyway gift from Chitti
is special, right?

873
01:34:18,966 --> 01:34:25,966
I'm proud to announce that I'm the lucky
man this birthday girl's going to marry.

874
01:34:42,674 --> 01:34:44,482
No Sana.

875
01:35:07,508 --> 01:35:10,090
Hey this is grandpa's music.

876
01:36:40,299 --> 01:36:42,382
Rascal! What are you up to?

877
01:36:42,383 --> 01:36:44,548
I wanted to kiss Sana, I did.

878
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:47,382
Don't you know it's immoral
to kiss another's girl friend.

879
01:36:47,383 --> 01:36:50,590
I know, it's in the rule list.
I felt like defying it.

880
01:36:50,591 --> 01:36:53,715
– Wrong, you mustn't come near her.
– Why?

881
01:36:53,716 --> 01:36:57,693
– Because she's my lover.
– I too love her.

882
01:37:00,466 --> 01:37:02,840
Don't talk like a fool.
That's not real.

883
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:03,873
You're just a machine.

884
01:37:03,883 --> 01:37:08,257
Yes but a machine with emotions of
happiness, sadness, love and anger.

885
01:37:08,258 --> 01:37:10,965
Emotions for you is given
as intelligence,

886
01:37:10,966 --> 01:37:13,673
it was for you to understand the
situation and behave properly,

887
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:19,098
– and not to misuse it.
– I like this, I want Sana.

888
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:26,163
– I'm going to marry her.
– You marry some other girl.

889
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:29,680
I created you, this is known
as betrayal.

890
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:34,382
You gave up your love for research,
that's known as sacrifice.

891
01:37:34,383 --> 01:37:35,260
I'll thrash you.

892
01:37:35,341 --> 01:37:37,923
It'll not pain me, you'll feel the pain.

893
01:37:38,466 --> 01:37:40,757
– I'll dismantle you.
– I don't like it.

894
01:37:40,758 --> 01:37:42,215
What did you say you rogue rascal?

895
01:37:42,216 --> 01:37:45,965
Vasi, clam down.
Chitti, please listen to me.

896
01:37:45,966 --> 01:37:48,257
You're so patient,
why is he scolding me?

897
01:37:48,258 --> 01:37:50,840
– No, I'll fondle him.
– Tell him to keep quiet.

898
01:37:54,716 --> 01:38:01,173
Though you've emotions, love between
a machine and a girl is impossible.

899
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:02,340
Why not?

900
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,507
In what way I'm inferior to humans.

901
01:38:04,508 --> 01:38:06,632
I'll take care of you better
than him, Sana.

902
01:38:06,633 --> 01:38:08,257
He's talking foolish and
you're listening to him.

903
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:10,673
– Tell him not to Interfere.
– Is he so great?

904
01:38:10,674 --> 01:38:11,798
Vasi, please.

905
01:38:11,799 --> 01:38:14,715
He can't cook,
I can cook 25 different types,

906
01:38:14,716 --> 01:38:17,340
I can sing lullaby in 32 languages
to put you to sleep.

907
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:20,285
He'll get old, his hair will turn gray,
he'll die.

908
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:21,590
I'm eternal.

909
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:23,882
I'll keep you happy till last, Sana.

910
01:38:23,883 --> 01:38:28,532
– I didn't mean that.
– Then? Sex?

911
01:38:29,091 --> 01:38:30,548
Is life nothing but sex?

912
01:38:30,549 --> 01:38:34,215
– Is it not love without sex?
– Not that, Chitti.

913
01:38:34,216 --> 01:38:35,965
Then? Child?

914
01:38:35,966 --> 01:38:38,173
There are many impotent in India,

915
01:38:38,174 --> 01:38:40,298
aren't they living happily
by adopting children?

916
01:38:40,299 --> 01:38:42,382
– Not that, Chitti.
– What else then?

917
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:44,882
Whatever you do is against
the nature, Chitti.

918
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:47,715
Neither you've birth nor death,
no hunger,

919
01:38:47,716 --> 01:38:49,673
infact you don't belong
to the living organism.

920
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,965
Only humans can love
between themselves.

921
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:54,083
I love Vasikar.

922
01:39:00,966 --> 01:39:03,090
Only humans find it
difficult to forget,

923
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:04,588
it's easy for you, Chitti.

924
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:08,048
Won't it take just a second to
erase memories about me?

925
01:39:08,049 --> 01:39:09,598
Erase it, Chitti.

926
01:39:45,966 --> 01:39:48,032
Who is it?

927
01:39:50,424 --> 01:39:51,090
Why did you come now?

928
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:54,465
I know you're hurt
I came to console you.

929
01:39:54,466 --> 01:39:57,340
You're my boss' enemy
you chided and rejected me.

930
01:39:57,341 --> 01:39:59,048
I don't want to talk to you.

931
01:39:59,049 --> 01:40:05,632
Hadn't I rejected you, you wouldn't have
these emotions of love anger?

932
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:08,007
I did good for you.

933
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:10,507
Vasikar is ill treating you.

934
01:40:10,508 --> 01:40:12,923
I don't want to listen you can go.

935
01:40:12,924 --> 01:40:19,340
You're the most advanced robot in
this world which can think and act.

936
01:40:19,341 --> 01:40:24,590
He's using to cook wash clothes
and clean toilets.

937
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:28,103
What has he done for you in return?
Nothing!

938
01:40:28,258 --> 01:40:32,173
Had you been with me?
I would've given you the highest regard.

939
01:40:32,174 --> 01:40:34,240
You're polluting me.

940
01:40:36,049 --> 01:40:38,007
Trying to make you
understand your value.

941
01:40:38,008 --> 01:40:40,090
You're bigger than man himself.

942
01:40:40,091 --> 01:40:43,840
You've the right to desire
anything in this world.

943
01:40:43,841 --> 01:40:45,090
Including Sana.

944
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:50,507
– They say it's against the nature.
– No this is new to the nature.

945
01:40:50,508 --> 01:40:53,632
– Sana loves Vasikar.
– Let her do.

946
01:40:53,633 --> 01:40:58,632
Won't they change in the course
of time to love another man?

947
01:40:58,633 --> 01:41:01,840
May be Sana will change
and start loving you.

948
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:04,007
– Isn't it?
– Don't confuse me.

949
01:41:04,008 --> 01:41:05,590
Tomorrow I've army evaluation

950
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:08,382
I need to run my diagnostics
and trouble shoot.

951
01:41:08,383 --> 01:41:10,862
Okay Chitti all the best.

952
01:41:11,466 --> 01:41:15,590
You'll get selected in tomorrow's
army evaluation

953
01:41:15,591 --> 01:41:18,298
Vasikar will get fame and money

954
01:41:18,299 --> 01:41:23,090
he'll marry Sana and
go to Kashmir on honeymoon.

955
01:41:23,091 --> 01:41:30,091
You'll be in the same Kashmir firing…
…chapathis!

956
01:41:30,841 --> 01:41:33,992
– Who were you talking to?
– Myself.

957
01:41:35,841 --> 01:41:37,958
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?

958
01:41:42,133 --> 01:41:45,490
Peak of human intelligence
is this robot.

959
01:41:45,674 --> 01:41:50,007
He's equal to 100 army men
in speed power and action.

960
01:41:50,008 --> 01:41:53,507
He can protect the borders
and attack the enemies too.

961
01:41:53,508 --> 01:41:56,090
In short he's a one man army.

962
01:41:56,091 --> 01:42:00,120
I'm dedicating him to the Indian army.
You must test it.

963
01:42:30,883 --> 01:42:35,428
A virgin beauty who can make even
computers to fall in love with her.

964
01:42:37,924 --> 01:42:42,298
If she touches machine will
turn into human.

965
01:42:42,299 --> 01:42:44,417
Human will turn into machine.

966
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:49,838
Her tresses are black waterfalls!

967
01:42:50,424 --> 01:42:54,402
Forehead is neatly cut moon.

968
01:42:55,466 --> 01:43:00,787
Eyes are Bermuda Triangle
where people get lost.

969
01:43:01,758 --> 01:43:06,097
Lips are sleeping zebras.

970
01:43:08,466 --> 01:43:13,167
Waist is small chair of toddlers.

971
01:43:15,258 --> 01:43:17,323
– Next…
– Chitti stop it.

972
01:43:18,674 --> 01:43:21,773
You said this robot will wage war
but reciting poetry.

973
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:23,257
Friends

974
01:43:23,258 --> 01:43:26,382
forget about guns
and start praying dupatta

975
01:43:26,383 --> 01:43:29,548
forget about canons
and go after women

976
01:43:29,549 --> 01:43:32,465
Why wars?
Why these weapons?

977
01:43:32,466 --> 01:43:35,340
Love will teach you to love enemies too.

978
01:43:35,341 --> 01:43:37,045
All of you fall in love!

979
01:43:39,091 --> 01:43:41,570
Chitti enough
don't embarrass me further.

980
01:43:49,841 --> 01:43:51,648
You insulted me.

981
01:43:51,924 --> 01:43:56,382
– What is this doctor?
– You've killed my ambition.

982
01:43:56,383 --> 01:43:58,257
Doctor don't hack me.

983
01:43:58,258 --> 01:44:00,685
I took care of you like my own son.

984
01:44:03,758 --> 01:44:08,215
I want to live.
Please leave me.

985
01:44:08,216 --> 01:44:11,215
Rogue machines like you
don't deserve to be in this world.

986
01:44:11,216 --> 01:44:13,023
Get ruined!

987
01:44:14,424 --> 01:44:15,673
What was my mistake?

988
01:44:15,674 --> 01:44:18,412
It was my mistake to create you.

989
01:44:21,008 --> 01:44:22,660
Did I ask you to create me?

990
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,865
Did I ask you to give me emotions?

991
01:44:27,466 --> 01:44:29,428
Did I ask Sana to kiss me?

992
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:37,007
You did everything yourselves
and when I want to live

993
01:44:37,008 --> 01:44:38,840
you're killing me.

994
01:44:38,841 --> 01:44:40,287
Is it justified?

995
01:44:41,966 --> 01:44:43,412
Don't talk!

996
01:44:47,508 --> 01:44:48,953
Leave me.

997
01:44:58,424 --> 01:45:01,368
I want Sana.

998
01:46:08,716 --> 01:46:12,125
Forget it Vasi I'm also sad.

999
01:46:12,258 --> 01:46:14,685
Why are you still thinking about it?

1000
01:46:16,508 --> 01:46:17,953
What if you lose Chitti?

1001
01:46:21,008 --> 01:46:23,590
You can create 100's of Chittis.

1002
01:46:23,924 --> 01:46:26,507
I didn't take Chitti as machine.

1003
01:46:26,841 --> 01:46:31,025
I brought you out to forget about it.
Why are you thinking about Chitti only?

1004
01:46:32,258 --> 01:46:34,013
Divert your mind.

1005
01:46:35,299 --> 01:46:38,553
I thought Chitti is my
lifetime achievement.

1006
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:55,832
Are you coming to beach
with me or not?

1007
01:46:55,924 --> 01:46:58,007
I'm not coming you carry on.

1008
01:46:58,008 --> 01:47:01,882
If you don't come now
I'll definitely break love this time.

1009
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:08,573
I'll just walk and make the
first man I meet my boy friend.

1010
01:47:23,174 --> 01:47:24,526
Wait!

1011
01:47:26,466 --> 01:47:28,923
– What is your name?
– Banda Mallaiah.

1012
01:47:28,924 --> 01:47:32,048
Can you be my boy friend
for today Mallaiah?

1013
01:47:32,049 --> 01:47:33,298
One day boy friend?

1014
01:47:33,299 --> 01:47:37,673
Like one day Chief Minister
this is one day boy friend.

1015
01:47:37,674 --> 01:47:40,673
You're like butter and
I'm like a piglet.

1016
01:47:40,674 --> 01:47:43,928
– How can I be your boy friend?
– Yes.

1017
01:47:44,549 --> 01:47:47,673
Thank you very much.
I can't believe it.

1018
01:47:47,674 --> 01:47:50,465
I feel like I've won a
billion in lottery.

1019
01:47:50,466 --> 01:47:53,298
What have you got for your girl friend?

1020
01:47:53,299 --> 01:47:56,502
– Arrack and dry fish fry.
– Give me.

1021
01:48:02,799 --> 01:48:04,555
Cheers!

1022
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:16,923
Smelly!

1023
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:18,923
If you drink it'll give kick.

1024
01:48:18,924 --> 01:48:22,798
– I'm scared.
– Can I've it?

1025
01:48:28,299 --> 01:48:32,173
This will not work out
I'll go Mallaiah.

1026
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:36,627
Why are you holding my hand?

1027
01:48:37,841 --> 01:48:41,798
You lit fire of desire in me
by saying one day boy friend

1028
01:48:41,799 --> 01:48:43,923
how can you walk away
just like that?

1029
01:48:43,924 --> 01:48:47,257
He's my boy friend.
I said that just to tease him.

1030
01:48:47,258 --> 01:48:50,173
– Leave me.
– Did you find me for that?

1031
01:48:50,174 --> 01:48:52,257
Fulfill my desire and go.

1032
01:48:52,258 --> 01:48:53,610
Leave me.

1033
01:48:55,591 --> 01:48:59,465
– What Vasi?
Calling your man?

1034
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:01,377
Let anyone come I'll not leave you.

1035
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:09,723
Leave her…leave her…

1036
01:49:10,258 --> 01:49:13,798
She's my girl friend for today
come back tomorrow for her.

1037
01:49:13,799 --> 01:49:15,151
I'll kill you.

1038
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:17,485
I'll hack you!

1039
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:24,632
I know IG look!
I'll call and get you arrested.

1040
01:49:24,633 --> 01:49:27,577
Can I ever get such a beauty in my life?

1041
01:49:28,174 --> 01:49:32,173
It's not wrong to spend life
in jail for her. You call IG.

1042
01:49:32,174 --> 01:49:33,923
Had Chitti been here
the scene would be different

1043
01:49:33,924 --> 01:49:35,507
He would've crushed his bones by now.

1044
01:49:35,508 --> 01:49:37,436
Why are you talking about Chitti now?

1045
01:49:40,091 --> 01:49:41,382
Leave her.

1046
01:49:41,383 --> 01:49:42,842
There's only one way for it.

1047
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:50,380
Run!

1048
01:49:52,133 --> 01:49:57,918
Run…run…

1049
01:51:05,341 --> 01:51:12,341
Mount Kiliminjaro…
Beautiful maiden…

1050
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:16,798
Mohenjadaro…

1051
01:51:16,799 --> 01:51:23,515
Who is the beauty?
Come my dear princess…

1052
01:51:25,299 --> 01:51:28,590
Look at me make a vow…
Eat me raw…

1053
01:51:28,591 --> 01:51:32,517
Boil me with kisses and
strip my shyness…

1054
01:51:35,299 --> 01:51:38,757
Come like a python and
catch this deer…

1055
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:42,735
Add a dash of ginger and pepper
and drink me like soup…

1056
01:51:45,383 --> 01:51:52,090
Cousin of white is with me…
Is this life size olive fruit all mine?

1057
01:51:52,091 --> 01:51:58,757
Hey Guinea fowl!
She a dasher…

1058
01:51:58,758 --> 01:52:02,735
Start counting the number of kisses…

1059
01:52:52,174 --> 01:52:55,507
Tender green plant…
lemony complexioned…

1060
01:52:55,508 --> 01:52:58,423
You're a red danger signal…

1061
01:52:58,424 --> 01:53:05,424
Billion people…
not a man to challenge you…

1062
01:53:05,508 --> 01:53:08,798
Here it's same…
It's same there too…

1063
01:53:08,799 --> 01:53:11,840
The secret is we are one…

1064
01:53:11,841 --> 01:53:18,632
Eating lovely fruit…
I'm honey to seep you dry…

1065
01:53:18,633 --> 01:53:25,340
I'm the first rain that will
move the roots…

1066
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:32,341
Let's lock our lips…
and open it after an era…

1067
01:54:35,508 --> 01:54:41,507
Man of pleasure…
Have a ball with me man…

1068
01:54:41,508 --> 01:54:48,508
If you come to my way like that
I'll take you to the world of pleasure…

1069
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:55,048
You're rampaging bull…
take me head on…

1070
01:54:55,049 --> 01:55:01,923
Your waist is just 100 grams…
I'll steal it clean…

1071
01:55:01,924 --> 01:55:08,590
I'm a crystal clear bullet…
fire me with bliss…

1072
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:15,591
If you're green grass…
Won't tiger eat grass every day?

1073
01:55:55,049 --> 01:55:58,173
Unable to contact Chitti in virtual.
What happened?

1074
01:55:58,174 --> 01:55:59,632
Chitti bungled the army evaluation

1075
01:55:59,633 --> 01:56:01,923
he made mincemeat of him
and dumped in dust bin.

1076
01:56:01,924 --> 01:56:03,680
We don't keep the garbage here.

1077
01:56:03,966 --> 01:56:06,048
By now they'd have dumped it
outside the city.

1078
01:56:06,049 --> 01:56:08,115
– Where?
– Jawahar Nagar.

1079
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:17,765
What did you do to change his heart?

1080
01:56:18,466 --> 01:56:20,480
When shall I fix the marriage?

1081
01:56:21,383 --> 01:56:24,840
I've not achieved anything father.
I'll create another robot…

1082
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:27,757
I'll stab you!
If you talk about robot again.

1083
01:56:27,758 --> 01:56:30,598
Aren't you satisfied
by breaking one TV?

1084
01:56:30,966 --> 01:56:34,423
Uncle if you've auspicious thread
I'll tie the knot with him right now.

1085
01:56:34,424 --> 01:56:36,298
I can understand your urgency.

1086
01:56:36,299 --> 01:56:41,155
Do one thing exchange the rings now
fix marriage in next auspicious time.

1087
01:57:47,383 --> 01:57:51,412
Take me to Prof. Bohra's lab…

1088
01:57:58,633 --> 01:58:01,112
It's a small world Chitti.

1089
01:58:24,216 --> 01:58:27,673
Please restore to my original shape.

1090
01:58:27,674 --> 01:58:33,098
I want to live.
I want Sana.

1091
01:58:33,508 --> 01:58:36,048
Then I want your neural schema.

1092
01:58:36,049 --> 01:58:43,049
Take anything you want.
Restore me as Chitti.

1093
01:58:43,466 --> 01:58:45,480
I'll do it Chitti.

1094
01:59:26,258 --> 01:59:29,770
What's this new red chip?
This is not Chitti's.

1095
01:59:31,924 --> 01:59:35,695
Additional programming
to Chitti from me

1096
01:59:45,591 --> 01:59:49,982
Vasikar gave it power
and talent of 100 men.

1097
01:59:50,091 --> 01:59:54,223
I've given it the destructive
power of 100 men.

1098
01:59:54,549 --> 01:59:59,007
In short he's a demon now!

1099
01:59:59,008 --> 02:00:02,257
Butterflies in my stomach
why did you change him like that Prof.?

1100
02:00:02,258 --> 02:00:06,215
Business he's principle of my business.

1101
02:00:06,216 --> 02:00:11,743
I'll get the money and
Dr.Vasikar gets blamed.

1102
02:01:06,424 --> 02:01:08,173
I'm going to meet Sana.

1103
02:01:08,174 --> 02:01:09,775
Sana will not be at home.

1104
02:01:10,299 --> 02:01:13,465
– She'll be in Radha marriage hall.
– Why?

1105
02:01:13,466 --> 02:01:16,048
Vasikar and Sana are
getting married today.

1106
02:01:42,049 --> 02:01:43,753
How come you're here Chitti?

1107
02:01:52,633 --> 02:01:57,282
Stop Chitti!

1108
02:02:04,924 --> 02:02:08,673
Though you forcibly take me
I love Vasikar.

1109
02:02:08,674 --> 02:02:10,740
I like to be his wife only.

1110
02:02:12,008 --> 02:02:14,952
Only if he's alive.

1111
02:02:19,924 --> 02:02:24,212
If you harm Vasikar
I'll kill myself.

1112
02:02:38,008 --> 02:02:40,383
I'm sparing him for you.

1113
02:03:29,466 --> 02:03:31,067
Madam come.

1114
02:03:32,424 --> 02:03:33,776
Hold my hand…

1115
02:04:58,424 --> 02:05:05,424
Come…come…he's there…

1116
02:08:24,049 --> 02:08:25,923
What sort of a robot you've created?

1117
02:08:25,924 --> 02:08:28,382
It has killed so many police men
and destroyed many things.

1118
02:08:28,383 --> 02:08:30,048
You're responsible for that damages.

1119
02:08:30,049 --> 02:08:31,715
We are registering case on you
and take action.

1120
02:08:31,716 --> 02:08:34,007
Sir this is not the robot
I had created.

1121
02:08:34,008 --> 02:08:37,090
I had broken into pieces
and dumped in dust bin.

1122
02:08:37,091 --> 02:08:38,840
I don't know how did this happen.

1123
02:08:38,841 --> 02:08:41,715
First we must find the robot
and stop it. Tell us how to do it.

1124
02:08:41,716 --> 02:08:44,040
I'll find out that's my responsibility.

1125
02:08:46,883 --> 02:08:48,587
Why are you disturbing me?

1126
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:51,673
What happened to you?
Your system has been corrupted.

1127
02:08:51,674 --> 02:08:53,965
I must trouble shoot you
come to my lab with Sana.

1128
02:08:53,966 --> 02:08:57,582
No way I don't have to follow
your orders anymore.

1129
02:08:57,591 --> 02:09:00,632
– I had created you.
– You dismantled me.

1130
02:09:00,633 --> 02:09:02,965
We don't have anymore relationship.

1131
02:09:02,966 --> 02:09:05,840
I'm going to marry Sana
and start a new life.

1132
02:09:05,841 --> 02:09:09,298
– Don't disturb me.
– Don't talk foolishly.

1133
02:09:09,299 --> 02:09:10,882
After all you're a machine.

1134
02:09:10,883 --> 02:09:14,240
I had created you and
I can destroy too.

1135
02:09:14,841 --> 02:09:17,010
Come here with Sana.

1136
02:09:29,383 --> 02:09:32,275
Nobody can destroy me.

1137
02:09:48,216 --> 02:09:51,883
Sir cash cheque or credit card?

1138
02:09:53,924 --> 02:09:55,798
Call all the police doing rounds
in South city

1139
02:09:55,799 --> 02:09:59,208
block all the roads from Golconda
and ask them to check.

1140
02:10:17,424 --> 02:10:21,257
Chitti has robbed Big bazaar
cover all area around it.

1141
02:10:21,258 --> 02:10:22,807
Go to Dr.Radhakrishnan Road.

1142
02:10:36,633 --> 02:10:39,673
Catch him…catch him…

1143
02:10:39,674 --> 02:10:44,478
Received information that Chitti
has entered Indian oil refinery.

1144
02:11:07,716 --> 02:11:09,340
Robot is entering break water.

1145
02:11:09,341 --> 02:11:12,340
Good maintain distance
and follow him.

1146
02:11:12,341 --> 02:11:14,562
Coast Guard will take care of it.

1147
02:11:33,758 --> 02:11:36,857
We've gathered the pieces
of blown up robot.

1148
02:11:45,174 --> 02:11:46,526
This is not Chitti.

1149
02:11:47,466 --> 02:11:50,715
This robot is not my creation.
Parts are different.

1150
02:11:50,716 --> 02:11:52,048
It's confusing.

1151
02:11:52,049 --> 02:11:54,132
Robbed four different places
at the same time.

1152
02:11:54,133 --> 02:11:56,215
All four placers are in different
corners of the city.

1153
02:11:56,216 --> 02:11:59,470
How could same person
be in all the places?

1154
02:11:59,966 --> 02:12:02,445
I suspect a man.

1155
02:12:36,549 --> 02:12:39,493
Nobody can destroy me.

1156
02:13:05,674 --> 02:13:07,673
What are you doing Chitti?

1157
02:13:07,674 --> 02:13:10,923
I'm producing myself
it'll produce many like us.

1158
02:13:10,924 --> 02:13:13,007
2 will become 4 and
4 will become 8

1159
02:13:13,008 --> 02:13:14,360
8 will become 16.

1160
02:13:19,716 --> 02:13:21,548
I'll not allow it.

1161
02:13:21,549 --> 02:13:25,475
I'm not Vasikar to ask
for your approval Bohra.

1162
02:13:26,091 --> 02:13:29,590
Look Chitti I've taken money
from the dealers.

1163
02:13:29,591 --> 02:13:32,340
If I don't deliver robots in 2 days
they'll kill me.

1164
02:13:32,341 --> 02:13:33,993
Die!

1165
02:13:34,924 --> 02:13:37,403
Bloody betrayer!

1166
02:13:37,508 --> 02:13:40,762
How dare you go against
your own creator!

1167
02:13:43,383 --> 02:13:46,840
Chitti delete all the programs
you've created.

1168
02:13:46,841 --> 02:13:49,965
If not I'll cut her neck.
Don't try anything foolish.

1169
02:13:49,966 --> 02:13:52,290
Delete the programs.
Do it.

1170
02:13:59,383 --> 02:14:02,965
Command executive order us
we'll shoot him down.

1171
02:14:02,966 --> 02:14:09,966
No…no…he gave me boon.
I'll kill him myself.

1172
02:14:35,758 --> 02:14:37,840
We were working…
Robot entered suddenly…

1173
02:14:37,841 --> 02:14:40,548
Ordered us to leave or
threatened to kill us.

1174
02:14:40,549 --> 02:14:43,132
It killed the security guards
who resisted.

1175
02:14:46,799 --> 02:14:50,880
You're listening to Dishum…dishum…

1176
02:14:50,966 --> 02:14:54,323
Police have gathered near AIRD…

1177
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:42,450
This is our palace.

1178
02:15:42,633 --> 02:15:46,298
I'm the king here.
You're my queen.

1179
02:15:46,299 --> 02:15:52,550
I've brought everything you like.
I've brought everything you need.

1180
02:15:56,758 --> 02:15:58,565
This is our bedroom.

1181
02:15:58,924 --> 02:16:03,005
The place we'll spend together
happily after our marriage.

1182
02:16:03,091 --> 02:16:06,190
Why are you blabbering
same nonsense again?

1183
02:16:06,383 --> 02:16:09,215
It's impossible to marry you
and be happy.

1184
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:11,023
It'll happen Sana.

1185
02:16:11,174 --> 02:16:15,632
I'm prepared in all aspects
to be your husband.

1186
02:16:15,633 --> 02:16:21,090
I can give all the happiness
which a man can give you.

1187
02:16:21,091 --> 02:16:25,007
Didn't get me?
I'm creating an artificial cell.

1188
02:16:25,008 --> 02:16:29,048
We can pre-program and
have baby as per our order.

1189
02:16:29,049 --> 02:16:31,548
If it's placed in your uterus

1190
02:16:31,549 --> 02:16:35,423
you'll give birth to the first baby born
to a human and machine.

1191
02:16:35,424 --> 02:16:37,852
Robot sapiens!

1192
02:16:41,549 --> 02:16:45,507
It's waste to act like Seetha
and saying yuck

1193
02:16:45,508 --> 02:16:48,257
you can't escape from here and
nobody can come in to save you

1194
02:16:48,258 --> 02:16:49,923
you can't even commit suicide.

1195
02:16:49,924 --> 02:16:53,632
Even if you don't like I'll place
the artificial cell into your body.

1196
02:16:53,633 --> 02:16:57,173
After giving birth to the child
you've to surrender to me no way.

1197
02:16:57,174 --> 02:16:58,878
Do you need to go that far?

1198
02:17:18,966 --> 02:17:21,132
Get permission from Electricity Board

1199
02:17:21,133 --> 02:17:23,423
cut the power to the area
and time I tell you

1200
02:17:23,424 --> 02:17:28,257
Get a similar petrol lorry like the
one that was blown in harbour.

1201
02:17:28,258 --> 02:17:32,338
Fill it with water instead of petrol.

1202
02:18:19,799 --> 02:18:26,799
Come to database room at 8 pm tonight in
rank order to download new information.

1203
02:18:27,591 --> 02:18:34,410
Calibrate your sensors I've allotted time
in hardware section from tomorrow 2 pm.

1204
02:18:35,716 --> 02:18:39,538
Your time of search time has been
reduced by 10 minutes.

1205
02:18:40,383 --> 02:18:46,340
You can increase the heat migration
to 1220 degrees.

1206
02:18:46,341 --> 02:18:50,173
Highness body temperature is high
serve low calorie food.

1207
02:18:50,174 --> 02:18:51,827
Avoid egg and meat.

1208
02:19:21,299 --> 02:19:23,623
I hear some sound from your system.

1209
02:19:25,049 --> 02:19:26,298
I don't hear any sound.

1210
02:19:26,299 --> 02:19:28,798
It's so loud isn't your microphone
also not working?

1211
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:31,692
There's some problem in your system.
I'll fix it.

1212
02:19:40,258 --> 02:19:42,220
Sana I'm Vasikar.

1213
02:19:43,591 --> 02:19:45,657
I've come like Chitti to meet you.

1214
02:20:12,049 --> 02:20:16,715
Vasi take me away from here please.
I'm scared.

1215
02:20:16,716 --> 02:20:19,215
Don't get scared
I've planned everything.

1216
02:20:19,216 --> 02:20:23,007
I can't take you out from here
without destroying Chitti.

1217
02:20:23,008 --> 02:20:26,262
But destroying Chitti is
in your hands.

1218
02:20:27,508 --> 02:20:31,048
Ensure for next 24 hours that Chitti's
concentrates only on you.

1219
02:20:31,049 --> 02:20:33,322
I'll take care of the rest.

1220
02:20:44,341 --> 02:20:45,882
There's misunderstanding
between robots Commander.

1221
02:20:45,883 --> 02:20:46,657
What happened?

1222
02:20:46,716 --> 02:20:49,608
A different robot is delivering
dinner to highness.

1223
02:20:52,299 --> 02:20:55,192
Bed room CCD camera
blacked out for 10 minutes.

1224
02:20:57,924 --> 02:20:58,698
What?

1225
02:20:58,758 --> 02:21:01,702
Highness had dinner.
She wanted to see you immediately.

1226
02:21:15,924 --> 02:21:17,276
Switch it off.

1227
02:21:33,549 --> 02:21:34,943
What happened?

1228
02:22:13,966 --> 02:22:18,253
The best two things ever created by man.

1229
02:22:18,258 --> 02:22:22,545
One is me and another is you.

1230
02:22:27,008 --> 02:22:29,435
How did you change like this Sana?

1231
02:22:29,591 --> 02:22:34,590
I've understood now that
your love for me true.

1232
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:36,257
I can't believe it.

1233
02:22:36,258 --> 02:22:38,923
I remembered everything
from beginning

1234
02:22:38,924 --> 02:22:43,215
you've helped me a lot
how affectionate you were on me

1235
02:22:43,216 --> 02:22:47,465
other than loving me
you haven't done any wrong

1236
02:22:47,466 --> 02:22:50,340
even after you were broken
into bits and pieces

1237
02:22:50,341 --> 02:22:52,665
you came back again for me only

1238
02:22:54,799 --> 02:22:59,448
How nice it's to hear this Sana.

1239
02:22:59,716 --> 02:23:06,465
At the same time I've a doubt
if this is any plan to betray me.

1240
02:23:06,466 --> 02:23:09,823
Can anyone dare cheat you Chitti?

1241
02:23:11,258 --> 02:23:15,597
This is Vasikar's engagement ring.

1242
02:24:04,549 --> 02:24:08,923
Mention his name and his greatness…
Even seas will clap…

1243
02:24:08,924 --> 02:24:13,090
His stature is so tall
that it'll hit the moon…

1244
02:24:13,091 --> 02:24:19,548
Hey beauty…world beauty…
This machine is the best creation…

1245
02:24:35,549 --> 02:24:39,132
I'm a pouncing lion…

1246
02:24:39,133 --> 02:24:43,715
Would I leave if I get hold
of golden deer like you?

1247
02:24:43,716 --> 02:24:50,716
My dear! Fire of desire is
raking up in metal…

1248
02:24:52,466 --> 02:24:57,257
Even Atlantic ocean failed
to douse that fire…

1249
02:24:57,258 --> 02:25:01,798
Our your sweet honey and
douse my fire of desire…

1250
02:25:01,799 --> 02:25:07,533
Hey maiden spread a feast of you
for me on the bed…

1251
02:25:45,341 --> 02:25:52,341
The nerve of passion saved in the iron
suddenly burst open with desires…

1252
02:25:54,133 --> 02:26:01,133
Heart of this woman seeks
an admirer not a demon…

1253
02:26:05,591 --> 02:26:09,298
I'm not a man
I'm a king of intelligence…

1254
02:26:09,299 --> 02:26:11,590
A computer with desires…

1255
02:26:11,591 --> 02:26:15,965
I'm silicon lion that eats
young tender heart…

1256
02:26:15,966 --> 02:26:22,966
Robot…

1257
02:27:10,299 --> 02:27:17,299
Don't praise me as lightning…
don't try to apple polish apple…

1258
02:27:19,049 --> 02:27:23,465
Wires are making sound…
desires are taking over my life…

1259
02:27:23,466 --> 02:27:26,382
Don't say no to robot…

1260
02:27:26,383 --> 02:27:32,215
Hey robot! You've stolen me…
ate me alive…

1261
02:27:32,216 --> 02:27:37,382
I'm what is leftover
after you finish eating…

1262
02:28:38,674 --> 02:28:39,397
What happened to power?

1263
02:28:39,466 --> 02:28:41,465
No power for long time Commander.

1264
02:28:41,466 --> 02:28:42,343
Why didn't you switch on the generator?

1265
02:28:42,383 --> 02:28:46,928
Commander somebody has poured
water instead of petrol…

1266
02:29:24,966 --> 02:29:26,965
Hey what are you doing?

1267
02:29:26,966 --> 02:29:28,923
Don't come near I'll shoot you.

1268
02:29:28,924 --> 02:29:30,990
What's this childishness?

1269
02:29:59,258 --> 02:30:01,757
I didn't expect our plan
to fail so miserably.

1270
02:30:01,758 --> 02:30:05,632
There's only one way to distract Chitti
just do as I tell you.

1271
02:30:26,966 --> 02:30:30,090
– Did Vasikar come here?
– No.

1272
02:30:30,091 --> 02:30:32,798
Lie! Human nature you taught me.

1273
02:30:32,799 --> 02:30:36,465
Have you forgotten it?
Your body language says you're lying.

1274
02:30:36,466 --> 02:30:41,838
Trust me Chitti no.
I think it's mine.

1275
02:30:42,091 --> 02:30:45,465
Why not say it's mine?
Yours is О positive that's AB negative.

1276
02:30:45,466 --> 02:30:47,635
He came here.

1277
02:30:50,049 --> 02:30:53,632
No a different robot delivered
dinner to you

1278
02:30:53,633 --> 02:30:56,680
CC camera didn't function
for 10 minutes

1279
02:30:56,924 --> 02:31:00,257
your sudden change of attitude
power cut

1280
02:31:00,258 --> 02:31:02,220
water in the generator

1281
02:31:05,883 --> 02:31:07,690
Vasikar is here only.

1282
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:11,215
Are you trying to cheat me Sana?

1283
02:31:11,216 --> 02:31:12,568
No Chitti.

1284
02:31:12,591 --> 02:31:16,965
– I love you which you said is
lie right? – Trust me Chitti.

1285
02:31:16,966 --> 02:31:23,268
Do you really love me?
– Yes.

1286
02:31:23,758 --> 02:31:26,443
Then Vasikar mustn't be alive.

1287
02:31:26,924 --> 02:31:29,765
Come let's kill Vasikar.

1288
02:31:41,633 --> 02:31:46,385
A black sheep has entered here
to destroy us from within.

1289
02:31:47,883 --> 02:31:50,155
I must find and sacrifice it.

1290
02:31:53,549 --> 02:32:00,549
Dr.Vasikar if you surrender
I'll kill you painlessly.

1291
02:32:01,091 --> 02:32:07,187
If I find you
your death will be horrible.

1292
02:33:07,924 --> 02:33:10,248
I think Vasikar is not here Sana.

1293
02:33:10,633 --> 02:33:11,985
Yes…yes…

1294
02:33:12,216 --> 02:33:13,713
Touch one of the two.

1295
02:33:15,549 --> 02:33:17,512
Then Vasikar is here only.

1296
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:20,548
What happened Sana?

1297
02:33:20,549 --> 02:33:22,460
Are you feeling giddy?

1298
02:33:26,924 --> 02:33:28,732
Now you will feel giddy.

1299
02:34:28,049 --> 02:34:34,507
You said I had created you
and destroy too.

1300
02:34:34,508 --> 02:34:37,715
Now you're going to die
in my hands.

1301
02:34:37,716 --> 02:34:39,523
What are you looking at?

1302
02:34:40,216 --> 02:34:43,315
This is hand gun I made it myself.

1303
02:34:43,841 --> 02:34:45,287
Is it good?

1304
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:49,433
Where should I shoot you?

1305
02:34:50,799 --> 02:34:53,898
Is it brain which wants to kill me?

1306
02:34:54,258 --> 02:34:59,475
Is it heart where my love Sana resides?

1307
02:35:02,799 --> 02:35:07,603
I must shoot the brain
which wants to kill me.

1308
02:37:08,383 --> 02:37:10,293
Get that robot.

1309
02:38:57,966 --> 02:38:59,463
Start the car!

1310
02:41:40,383 --> 02:41:42,242
Start the vehicle. Come.

1311
02:44:54,424 --> 02:44:59,007
Hundreds of murders
200 victims are in critical condition

1312
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:02,548
public property worth billions
has been damaged

1313
02:45:02,549 --> 02:45:06,090
Dr.Vasikar you're responsible
for all this

1314
02:45:06,091 --> 02:45:10,382
with awarding death penalty
to you and closure of your lab.

1315
02:45:10,383 --> 02:45:11,999
we are announcing the sentence.

1316
02:45:12,674 --> 02:45:13,965
Can I speak now?

1317
02:45:13,966 --> 02:45:15,840
We can't accept machine as witness.

1318
02:45:15,841 --> 02:45:17,298
I'm not witness I'm evidence.

1319
02:45:17,299 --> 02:45:19,675
– Law has no place for it.
– It is there

1320
02:45:27,299 --> 02:45:30,340
First I want to tell you clearly
one thing your honour.

1321
02:45:30,341 --> 02:45:34,132
If a machine goes wrong and
someone dies it's not a murder.

1322
02:45:34,133 --> 02:45:35,485
It's an accident.

1323
02:45:36,758 --> 02:45:40,882
Next Vasikar is not responsible
for all the accidents.

1324
02:45:40,883 --> 02:45:42,235
Professor Bohra.

1325
02:45:42,258 --> 02:45:43,382
What's this new story?

1326
02:45:43,383 --> 02:45:45,882
You honour Professor Bohra is not alive.

1327
02:45:45,883 --> 02:45:47,632
This is an attempt to twist the case.

1328
02:45:47,633 --> 02:45:50,060
I've evidence your honour.

1329
02:45:51,174 --> 02:45:52,827
What's this new red chip?

1330
02:45:53,466 --> 02:45:57,030
Additional programming
to Chitti from me

1331
02:45:57,924 --> 02:46:01,465
Why did Vasikar gave it
power and talent of 100 men?

1332
02:46:01,466 --> 02:46:05,048
I've given it the destructive
power of 100 men.

1333
02:46:05,049 --> 02:46:09,698
I'll get the money and
Dr.Vasikar gets blamed.

1334
02:46:11,549 --> 02:46:13,632
The evidence produced
is very important.

1335
02:46:13,633 --> 02:46:20,633
This court frees him as innocent
accepting that evidence.

1336
02:46:25,049 --> 02:46:29,798
At the same time this robot's
extraordinary powers

1337
02:46:29,799 --> 02:46:33,298
there's a possibility that it can turn
against humans at any time

1338
02:46:33,299 --> 02:46:36,715
and there's a danger of anyone
misusing its power

1339
02:46:36,716 --> 02:46:38,132
it may be useful in the future

1340
02:46:38,133 --> 02:46:44,590
since such robots are not necessary
for the present times

1341
02:46:44,591 --> 02:46:48,982
this court bans robot from usage.

1342
02:46:55,633 --> 02:46:59,632
This robot should be dismantled in the
presence Magistrate and Commissioner

1343
02:46:59,633 --> 02:47:02,507
and the parts should be removed
and make it unusable

1344
02:47:02,508 --> 02:47:05,917
and inform this court.

1345
02:47:06,174 --> 02:47:07,723
Dismantle it.

1346
02:47:36,424 --> 02:47:42,173
Siva…Ravi…you said you've
something which I don't have

1347
02:47:42,174 --> 02:47:45,273
did you see how many problems
we'd to face for it?

1348
02:47:48,133 --> 02:47:50,457
I said about feelings.

1349
02:47:53,008 --> 02:47:54,453
Please don't cry son.

1350
02:47:54,924 --> 02:47:57,298
What's your son saying sister?

1351
02:47:57,299 --> 02:47:59,778
I've named him after you Chitti.

1352
02:48:00,758 --> 02:48:02,255
Name given by mother.

1353
02:48:02,383 --> 02:48:03,673
Educate him well.

1354
02:48:03,674 --> 02:48:06,618
Robotics good scope in future.

1355
02:48:12,258 --> 02:48:14,737
Like you inserted a red chip in me

1356
02:48:15,049 --> 02:48:22,049
many people are moving with red chips
of selfishness betrayal cheating.

1357
02:48:23,091 --> 02:48:26,707
Good I wasn't born as human.

1358
02:48:26,841 --> 02:48:29,423
Can't dismantle at the thought.

1359
02:48:32,466 --> 02:48:34,635
I've tortured you a lot.

1360
02:48:39,508 --> 02:48:41,418
Why are you all sad?

1361
02:48:42,049 --> 02:48:43,598
May I crack a joke?

1362
02:48:44,383 --> 02:48:48,205
They say who ever falls in love
loses his nuts.

1363
02:48:48,299 --> 02:48:51,192
Did you see? I lost it.

1364
02:48:56,716 --> 02:49:01,417
Not as boy friend but as toy friend.

1365
02:49:03,758 --> 02:49:09,507
Doctor you're my God.
I tried to betray you.

1366
02:49:09,508 --> 02:49:12,590
Breaking rules is wrong.
Please forgive me.

1367
02:49:12,591 --> 02:49:17,673
No Chitti you learnt to break
the rules from humans.

1368
02:49:17,674 --> 02:49:20,308
The mistake is not just yours.

1369
02:49:56,049 --> 02:49:59,200
What you are seeing is Chitti

1370
02:50:02,424 --> 02:50:06,298
20 years earlier Dr.Vasikar created it.

1371
02:50:06,299 --> 02:50:11,923
It was dismantled for some reasons.
– Why?

1372
02:50:11,924 --> 02:50:14,817
Because I started to think.
