1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,510
You can come on out.

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,230
It's an actual store.

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,230
Mm-hm.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,070
I guess I figured

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,070
"vacuum cleaner repair"

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,070
was a term of art.

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,550
If you would step right here

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,550
on this blue spot.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,590
Leave your luggage

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,590
where it is for the moment.

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,430
That good?

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,230
Sure.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,230
What about this?

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,990
I'll Photoshop that out.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,750
Oh, Nebraska.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,750
What's in Nebraska?

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,750
You. From now on.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,670
It's gonna take me some time

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,670
to get your new situation fixed.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,150
Until then, you're gonna be staying here.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,150
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,550
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,550
comfortable enough for short-term.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
How short-term?

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,110
Considering you got your face up

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,110
on buses and billboards all over town,

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,550
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,430
Maybe three.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,630
Only thing is,

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,710
and I don't like to do this,

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,350
but, uh,

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,350
you'll have a bunk mate.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,550
Oh, yeah? He's still here?

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,150
For the moment.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,910
He's a special case.

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,910
Gonna take some doing.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,310
How's he holding up?

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,750
You be the judge.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,190
We will find Hank.

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,350
Steve too.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,230
They're out there,

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,230
and we're gonna find them.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,430
You have my word.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Sir.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,950
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,750
I, uh, get to his door,

47
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,350
and I could hear music inside.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,870
Like squeaky voices.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,590
And I thought, you know, maybe, uh...

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,510
I knocked on his door.

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,070
The music stopped,

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,070
and then he was right there.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,990
When he saw the gun, he thought...

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,590
Hey, Kenny.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,350
Does this pussy cry

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,350
through the entire thing?

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,190
Just watch.

58
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,910
He kept saying that, you know,

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,910
"You don't have to do this."

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,630
His eyes were so big.

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,670
They high-fived because it worked.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,670
Such a bitch. He won't quit.

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,950
Then, you know, we turn around

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,280
and there is this kid on a dirt bike

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,190
looking at us.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
Drew Sharp.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,870
That kid that went missing

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,870
up in White Horse.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,520
It's him.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,350
And then out of nowhere,

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,590
Todd, that Opie,

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,590
dead-eyed piece of shit,

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,990
pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,510
This is Todd Alquist

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,510
we're talking about?

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,470
He killed Drew Sharp?

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,590
Boom. Like it was nothing.

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,550
Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,630
We should keep him for a while,

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,630
get a couple of cooks under our belt.

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,510
You seriously giving me

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,510
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,350
He ratted you out, personally.

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,350
We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,630
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth?

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,630
We won the lottery here.

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,630
We've got all the money

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,630
in the world. You're talking

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,630
to me about selling crank?

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,790
I mean, this is millions,

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,790
Uncle Jack.

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,190
No matter how much you got,

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,190
how do you turn your back on more?

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,240
You little...

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,550
son of a bitch.

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
It's that Lydia woman.

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
You're sweet on her,

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
you little bastard.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
Ha, ha, ha.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,910
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

101
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,910
Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?

102
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,590
Come on.

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,270
You can do better.

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,910
That one's so uptight,

105
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,910
probably got a wood chipper

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,910
for a coochie.

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,950
Stick it in down there,

108
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,950
you're pulling back a stump.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,430
Oh, what the hell?

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,060
Heart wants what

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,060
the heart wants, right?

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,070
Let's go back

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,070
and watch some more

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,070
of that crybaby rat, huh?

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,030
How thick is it?

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,350
This is mild steel?

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,870
Uh-huh.

118
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,630
No, this would be cash.

119
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,790
What?

120
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,790
Nothing.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,750
Hey, you know what?

122
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,470
Make yourself useful.

123
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,670
Give me a list of hitters,

124
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,670
mercenaries.

125
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,710
Yes, yes, I remember.

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,710
You've got "concerns."

127
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,150
Don't worry.

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,150
We'll take the time to vet them.

129
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,550
Make sure there are no

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,550
undercover cops on the team.

131
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,950
Five should do it, providing

132
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,950
they're the right men for the job.

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,270
I'm gonna hate myself for asking,

134
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,270
but who are we hitting?

135
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,470
Jack Welker and his men.

136
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,430
They murdered Hank.

137
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,430
They stole my life's work.

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't know any hit men.

139
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,710
You know a guy

140
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,710
who knows a guy.

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,030
Just get me the contacts.

142
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,030
Anybody in that world.

143
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,990
I'm paying top dollar.

144
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,990
We'll find them.

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,670
You mind if I give you

146
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,670
a nickel's worth of advice?

147
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,990
Just for old time's sake?

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,550
You're worried about

149
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,550
your wife and kids?

150
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,940
Don't leave.

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,030
The way things are now,

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,030
some people-- Not me, mind you,

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,030
but some people might say

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,030
you're leaving her high and dry.

155
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,460
Some people would be

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,460
ignorant on the facts.

157
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,790
Some people wouldn't know

158
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,790
that as far as the police

159
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,790
are concerned,

160
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,790
Skyler is a blameless victim.

161
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,190
No, no, no. Go ahead.

162
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,390
Get it off your chest.

163
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,310
Go on.

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,070
The phone call was

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,070
a smart move. Kudos to you.

166
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,070
Odds are it was recorded.

167
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,070
It'll play great for a jury.

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,110
It might even buy her

169
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,110
a mistrial.

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
In a year and a half. Until then,

171
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
if they don't have you,

172
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
they go after her.

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,590
There's no point. She knows nothing.

174
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,590
Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.

175
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,110
I hate to be a downer here,

176
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,230
but there are two

177
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,230
DEA agents missing,

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,230
presumed dead.

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,830
Think the feds will let that go

180
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,830
because you hit the ejector seat?

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,270
First thing they're gonna do,

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,270
they will RICO your wife

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,270
and kids out of the house.

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,150
That condo is gone.

185
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,150
Your bank accounts,

186
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,150
they're frozen.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,230
Her picture is probably on TV

188
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,230
right now, next to yours.

189
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,230
Who's gonna hire her?

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,870
Money is no problem.

191
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,870
Well, I don't mean to contradict you,

192
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
but getting it to her, impossible.

193
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,790
The feds are praying

194
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,790
that you'll make contact.

195
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,270
The Internet, the phone,

196
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,270
it's all tapped.

197
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,710
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,590
But every time he tried to get

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,590
his nest egg to his granddaughter,

200
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,870
it ended up

201
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,870
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

202
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,710
So you propose what?

203
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,870
Stay. Face the music.

204
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,190
I mean, how much time

205
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,190
have you got left? You walk in

206
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,190
with your head held high,

207
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,870
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan

208
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,870
Detention Center. How bad is that?

209
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,110
And you bring a barrel

210
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,110
full of drug money.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,550
Maybe that soothes

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,550
some troubled waters.

213
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,440
Maybe they let your family stay

214
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,440
in the house.

215
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,830
After all, the house predates

216
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,830
the criminal enterprise.

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,950
God, you think I want to run?!

218
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
This is the last thing

219
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
that I want.

220
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,830
This-- This changes nothing.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,630
What I do, I do for my family.

222
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,910
My money goes to my children.

223
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,150
Not just this barrel. All of it!

224
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,910
I'm going to kill Jack

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,910
and his entire crew,

226
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,590
and I'm gonna take back what is mine

227
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,590
and give it to my children.

228
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,400
And then, and only then...

229
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,830
am I through.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,030
Do you understand?

231
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,950
Everything good?

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,710
Define "good."

233
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,670
You're set. Time to go.

234
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,190
You'll be a little longer.

235
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,390
I'm still working on transportation.

236
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,960
Change of plans.

237
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,230
He's coming with me.

238
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,030
No. No, that's not--

239
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,030
We're going together. I can use him.

240
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,510
I'll give you two a minute.

241
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,350
Hey, I'm a civilian.

242
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,350
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

243
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,310
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun is over.

244
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,310
From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,910
A douche bag with a job

246
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,910
and three pairs of Dockers.

247
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,580
If I'm lucky, month from now,

248
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,580
best-case scenario,

249
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,830
I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.

250
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,830
You're still part of this,

251
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,470
whether you like it or not.

252
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,470
Sorry. I don't think so.

253
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,910
You remember what I told you?

254
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,830
It's not over until--

255
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,470
It's over.

256
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,110
Do you want us to cuff her now?

257
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,110
Would that make you feel better?

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,550
Your client admits to...

259
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,630
Her day of reckoning is now.

260
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,750
--by the time this goes to trial.

261
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,790
Is she even listening?

262
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,550
Mrs. White?

263
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,670
Are you following all this?

264
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,950
Do you understand

265
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,950
what's happening here?

266
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,230
Yes.

267
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,190
I understand.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,110
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,150
I understand that you will use

270
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,150
everything in your power

271
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,870
against me and my children unless--

272
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,230
Unless I give you Walt.

273
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,710
But the truth is,

274
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,710
I can't give you what you want.

275
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,550
I don't know where he is.

276
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,140
All right, go and discuss this

277
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,140
with your lawyer here.

278
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,030
Rack your brain.

279
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,270
And hope you can come up

280
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,270
with something we can use.

281
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,870
Four-seventeen?

282
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,790
Four-seventeen. No activity.

283
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
Ma'am, is there anybody else

284
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
in the house?

285
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
What about your son?

286
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,630
If I go look in his room,

287
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,630
am I gonna see him?

288
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,350
He's not gonna pop out

289
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,350
and surprise me?

290
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,910
If this guy takes his hand away,

291
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,910
are you gonna scream?

292
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,510
He's at his friend's house.

293
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,510
He's been there all week.

294
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,510
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.

295
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,470
Please-- Please.

296
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,470
Ma'am.

297
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,110
We got a lot of respect

298
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,110
for your husband.

299
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,430
There's just something

300
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,430
that we gotta straighten out.

301
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,950
Okay, we know that you've

302
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,950
been talking to the police,

303
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,030
and that's okay.

304
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,030
You gotta do that.

305
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,990
But you've seen some people.

306
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,150
Like that lady

307
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,150
who came into the car wash.

308
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,550
The one with the black hair.

309
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,110
You said anything about her?

310
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,980
No.

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,350
You sure about that?

312
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,990
I didn't.

313
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,310
The police don't need

314
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,310
to know anything about her.

315
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,790
Okay, ma'am,

316
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,790
I'm gonna need you to say it.

317
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,790
I will not

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,230
say anything about her. Ever.

319
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,680
I swear.

320
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,950
Okay.

321
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,780
When we leave,

322
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,780
you're not gonna go running

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,780
to those police officers out front?

324
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,830
No.

325
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,440
Okay.

326
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,080
Okay.

327
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,950
Because you really

328
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,950
don't want us coming back.

329
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,510
Uh-huh. Sure.

330
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,070
Don't. Stay where you are.

331
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,030
We'll talk like this.

332
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,360
Okay.

333
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,150
So that thing that we talked about,

334
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,150
I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house--

335
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,430
You don't have to say the name.

336
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,390
Sure. And it went really good.

337
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,630
I mean, the message was received

338
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,630
loud and clear.

339
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,270
The message? Yeah.

340
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,110
Look, I know you did your best.

341
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,110
I just think--

342
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,110
Hi. What can I get you?

343
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,590
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.

344
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,220
And I'll need more stevia.

345
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,220
Sure.

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,510
The person we're discussing

347
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,510
saw my face.

348
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
You're not Western Union.

349
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,190
We can't just settle

350
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,190
for you sending messages.

351
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,550
Really, if you'd been there,

352
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,550
I think you'd see it different.

353
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,590
We threw a real scare into her.

354
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,830
She seems like a nice lady

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,830
watching out for her kids.

356
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,300
So you're not going to have

357
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,300
a problem with her.

358
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,790
I can pretty much guarantee it.

359
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,790
I wish I had your certainty,

360
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,510
but I'm not like you and your uncle.

361
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,510
I'm just-- I'm not used to this kind of risk.

362
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,990
We're gonna have to take a break.

363
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,070
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed

364
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,070
and ready to go.

365
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,510
And I wish you all the luck

366
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,510
in the world with it.

367
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,230
It's 92 percent.

368
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,510
I'm sorry?

369
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,270
Ninety-two percent.

370
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,750
Truly?

371
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,750
Tested it twice.

372
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,390
And it's blue, just like before.

373
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,430
Ninety-two.

374
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,430
That's Heisenberg level.

375
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,910
He's not with you?

376
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,950
Well, next best thing.

377
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,950
Pinkman.

378
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,070
They're looking for Pinkman.

379
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,590
Well, they're not going

380
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,590
to find him. He's with us

381
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,590
and he's not going anywhere.

382
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,550
Ms. Quayle, this is what

383
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,550
your guys in Europe have

384
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,550
been begging for, right?

385
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,910
I just think we work together good.

386
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,390
We make a good team.

387
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,310
I think it's kind of

388
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,710
mutually good.

389
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,910
Ninety-two percent.

390
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,590
Unh.

391
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,550
Unh.

392
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,070
Mr. Lambert,

393
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,070
welcome to New Hampshire.

394
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,670
All right.

395
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,270
Let's have a look at this place.

396
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,070
You got about a month's worth

397
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,070
of food on hand.

398
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,240
Most of it is canned goods,

399
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,240
but there's steaks in the freezer.

400
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,990
You got a generator outside,

401
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,990
works on LP.

402
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Ought to be enough in the tank

403
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,760
to last the winter.

404
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,470
It's only 15 amps, but that

405
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,470
ought to do for the lights,

406
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,470
the TV and the freezer.

407
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,910
That's a wood-burner.

408
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,350
Ought to warm the place up

409
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,350
pretty good.

410
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
Plus you can cook on it.

411
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,790
On the TV front,

412
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,790
the reception's pretty much nil.

413
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
You got some mountains

414
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
in the way.

415
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,550
Weather is right, you might

416
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,550
be able to catch Montreal,

417
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,310
but mostly

418
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,310
you'll be limited to DVDs.

419
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,990
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

420
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,790
Two copies. Hm.

421
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm not much of a movie guy.

422
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,350
I'll make a supply run

423
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,350
next month.

424
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,870
You want something else

425
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,870
to watch, put it on the list.

426
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,310
Supply run. Heh.

427
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,310
Fifty thousand dollars

428
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,310
for a trip to Costco.

429
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
It's risk.

430
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,910
And risk is what

431
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,910
you're paying me for,

432
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,910
not toilet paper.

433
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,750
Risk and a 4400-mile

434
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,750
round trip.

435
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,230
Mr. Lambert,

436
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,510
my clients and I don't

437
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,510
usually have an ongoing

438
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,510
relationship.

439
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,950
Normally you and I

440
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,950
would have already

441
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,950
gone our separate ways,

442
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,680
but you're you.

443
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,510
Where's the phone?

444
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,510
No phone.

445
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,120
Up here, ice storms

446
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,120
equal service calls,

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,120
equal you in cuffs.

448
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,830
Internet?

449
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,830
Same deal.

450
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,470
Also satellite, cable TV,

451
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,470
drop phone, car.

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,070
You want news,

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,070
I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.

454
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,990
Whatever you need, just put it on the list.

455
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,990
Put it on the list. Yeah.

456
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Look, I have business to conduct.

457
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,150
Your business is your business.

458
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,190
My business is keeping you

459
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,190
out of custody.

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,350
You are the target

461
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,350
of a nation-wide manhunt.

462
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,550
Your face is all over TV.

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,310
You are the hottest client

464
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,310
I have ever had, by far.

465
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,510
It stands to reason

466
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,510
you've got to keep out of sight.

467
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,950
And what's keeping me

468
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,950
from walking out that gate?

469
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
Nothing.

470
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,710
There's a little one-horse town

471
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,710
eight miles down the hill.

472
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,110
There's not a thing

473
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,110
on God's green earth

474
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,790
that I can do to stop you

475
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,790
going down there.

476
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,440
All I'm saying is...

477
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,110
if you leave this place,

478
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,110
you will get caught.

479
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,390
And I gotta tell you,

480
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,230
if I find out that

481
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,230
you've left the reservation,

482
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,710
I won't be coming back.

483
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,590
That is for my own safety.

484
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,590
You understand?

485
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,590
Sure.

486
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,470
Know how to work

487
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,470
the stove?

488
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,470
The flue can be tricky.

489
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,470
Yeah, I got it.

490
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,430
You paid good money for this.

491
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,150
You got two acres up here,

492
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,150
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

493
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,270
Seems to me just the spot

494
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,270
for a man to rest up

495
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,270
and think on things.

496
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,830
If you look around,

497
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,830
it's kind of beautiful.

498
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,510
You've been very helpful.

499
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,510
Thank you.

500
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,470
See you in a month.

501
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,190
Tomorrow.

502
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,430
Tomorrow.

503
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,270
Oh. Huh.

504
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,550
Come--

505
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh, so you're just too good

506
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
to eat with the rest of us, huh?

507
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
- It's not for me.

508
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
- Damn, man, seriously.

509
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,070
That's not my chocolate chip,

510
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,070
is it?

511
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,390
You're gonna spoil him.

512
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,790
Hey, you awake?

513
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,790
Uh, yeah.

514
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,780
We had some Ben & Jerry's.

515
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,430
There's peanut butter cup

516
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,430
and AmeriCone Dream.

517
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,510
I didn't know what you liked,

518
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,510
so I got you some of each.

519
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,990
There you go.

520
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,030
So that batch that you just cooked

521
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,030
was 96 percent.

522
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,670
Kind of figured you deserved

523
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,670
a little something.

524
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,910
Thanks.

525
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
Well, better get some sleep.

526
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,310
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

527
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,950
Got a whole new batch.

528
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,710
Hey, Todd.

529
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,710
Yeah?

530
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,790
Would you mind

531
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,790
leaving the tarp off tonight?

532
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,070
Well, might get cold.

533
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,630
No, I don't mind. I just...

534
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,070
I just wanna see the stars.

535
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,310
Sure. Okay.

536
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,990
Thanks.

537
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,550
Well, good night, Jesse.

538
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,190
Night.

539
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,760
Okay. Okay. Okay.

540
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,590
Okay.

541
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,390
Come on, bitch.

542
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,080
Go ahead! Do it!

543
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,470
Just kill me now and get it over with,

544
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,470
because there's no way

545
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,150
I'm doing one more cook

546
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,150
for you psycho fucks!

547
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,630
Yes?

548
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,630
Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?

549
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
You're Andrea, right?

550
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,590
How can I help you?

551
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,630
You know Jesse Pinkman?

552
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,990
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his.

553
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,990
My name's Todd.

554
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,870
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

555
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,870
but it's nice to meet you.

556
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,310
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

557
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,830
Yeah, he's okay.

558
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,150
Actually, I brought him with me.

559
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,590
Jesse's here?

560
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,030
Yeah, he's right over there

561
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,030
in that truck.

562
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,070
Where?

563
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,630
No!

564
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,350
Just so you know,

565
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,350
this isn't personal.

566
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,140
No!

567
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,190
Whoa, hey, settle down.

568
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,710
Settle down.

569
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,550
Hey, remember.

570
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,710
There's still the kid.

571
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,110
I brought you a couple

572
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,110
of cases of Ensure.

573
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,110
Maybe put a little weight on you.

574
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,500
Jesus.

575
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,230
I can barely read this.

576
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,470
Ah. Almost forgot.

577
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,390
Without a prescription, I had to take

578
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,390
an educated guess and shotgun it.

579
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,060
One of these ought to come close.

580
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,060
Oh.

581
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,390
Did you check on them?

582
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,190
Is Skyler in a better place?

583
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,630
No, she's still at that place

584
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,630
off of Eubank.

585
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,150
Kids are both still with her

586
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,150
for the moment.

587
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,790
There's no court date yet.

588
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,510
The news was talking

589
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,510
about a grand jury,

590
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,510
but they didn't say when.

591
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,110
I saw her public defender

592
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,110
on TV.

593
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,550
Looks like a deer

594
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,550
in the headlights.

595
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,360
Think I got socks older

596
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,360
than him.

597
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,710
What are they doing for money?

598
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,910
She's doing taxi dispatch,

599
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,910
part-time.

600
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,630
Leaves the baby with a neighbor

601
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,630
when she goes in.

602
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,870
I saw her shopping one time.

603
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,470
She looks pretty good.

604
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,070
And she's using her

605
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,070
maiden name.

606
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,830
I wouldn't take that personally,

607
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,830
under the circumstances.

608
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,150
Those working for you?

609
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,990
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,950
I took a run

611
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,950
by your old house.

612
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,430
The auction's still pending.

613
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,470
They put a fence up around it.

614
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,750
They put up a fence?

615
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,070
Seems like the place got to be kind of

616
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,070
a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.

617
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,350
The neighbors complained,

618
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,350
so the bank put up a fence.

619
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,710
You ready?

620
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,710
Hm?

621
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,150
Yeah.

622
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,390
Sorry about last time.

623
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,400
It should go better now.

624
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,400
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.

625
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,470
It's all about finding the vein.

626
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,390
Give it to me. I'll do it.

627
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,630
Here, you do it.

628
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,150
Make a fist. Tight.

629
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,150
There we go.

630
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,230
All right, it's just...

631
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Stick.

632
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,030
That's it. Okay. Hey.

633
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,590
Pretty good.

634
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,590
There you go.

635
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,390
Think I had worse

636
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,390
my last physical.

637
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,060
I will see you on...

638
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,270
Let's see.

639
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,030
Afternoon of the 15th.

640
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,390
Stay a little longer?

641
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,270
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.

642
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,550
Two hours?

643
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,030
I'll give you another $10,000.

644
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Please.

645
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,030
Ten thousand.

646
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,990
One hour.

647
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,550
Cards?

648
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,630
All right, well...

649
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,750
The game will be seven-card.

650
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,390
I'll deal,

651
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,390
since you are encumbered.

652
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,950
One of these days,

653
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,950
when you come up here,

654
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,830
I'll be dead.

655
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,030
My money over there.

656
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,030
What happens to it then?

657
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,190
What if I ask you

658
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,190
to give it to my family?

659
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,510
Would you do it?

660
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,590
If I said yes...

661
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,350
would you believe me?

662
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,510
You wanna cut the cards?

663
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
No.

664
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,670
A king.

665
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,350
Two kings.

666
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,430
Flynn White to the principal's office,

667
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,430
please.

668
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,670
I'm sorry to pull you

669
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,670
out of class.

670
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,190
It's your aunt Marie.

671
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,030
It sounds very important.

672
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,830
You can take it in here, okay?

673
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,830
Okay.

674
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,630
Here he is.

675
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Thank you.

676
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,030
Hey, Aunt Marie.

677
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,830
What's--? What's going on?

678
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,030
Hold on a sec, honey.

679
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,550
Look at those numbers for Denver.

680
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,070
Things haven't gone their way.

681
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,960
Son, it's me.

682
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,960
Please, don't let on.

683
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,070
Carmen is nearby, right?

684
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,070
She cannot know.

685
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,670
Son, are you there?

686
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,110
Yes.

687
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,950
It's so good to hear your voice.

688
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,590
I, uh...

689
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,350
Son, the things that they're saying

690
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,590
about me.

691
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,070
I did wrong.

692
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,070
I made some terrible mistakes.

693
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,470
But the reasons were always...

694
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,310
Things happened

695
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,310
that I never intended.

696
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,270
I never intended--

697
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,790
Listen, son, we don't have much time.

698
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,470
Is Louis' family still

699
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,470
at 4848 Newcombe?

700
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,070
Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,

701
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,200
does his family still live

702
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,200
in that same place up on Newcombe?

703
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,150
Yes.

704
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,150
Okay, good.

705
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,590
Okay, he's a good kid.

706
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,590
He's like you. He'll understand.

707
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,550
I'm sending Louis a package.

708
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,750
Now, it's addressed to Louis,

709
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,750
but it's for you,

710
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,590
your mother and your sister.

711
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,070
There's money inside.

712
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,790
About $100,000. Okay?

713
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,670
I think.

714
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,030
It was all that I could fit into the box.

715
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,750
It has to be a secret.

716
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,390
If anyone says a word,

717
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,390
the police will take it.

718
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,830
I wanted to give you so much more.

719
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,470
But this is all I could do.

720
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,750
Do you understand?

721
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,790
Son?

722
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,670
Can you hear me?

723
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,670
Do you understand?

724
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,620
You want to send money?

725
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,630
Yes. Good.

726
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,750
Good, good.

727
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,420
So you'll talk to Louis, right?

728
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,990
You killed Uncle Hank.

729
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,270
You killed him!

730
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,270
Listen. Wait. Wait, son.

731
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,830
No. What you did to Mom-- You asshole.

732
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,830
Please--

733
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,320
You killed Uncle Hank.

734
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,030
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.

735
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,030
Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.

736
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,270
I don't want anything from you.

737
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,350
I don't give a shit.

738
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,590
You need this money.

739
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,590
You killed Uncle Hank.

740
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,950
You killed him!

741
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,950
Your mother needs this money.

742
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,430
It can't all be for nothing.

743
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,430
What you did--

744
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,030
Please. Please.

745
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,030
Just shut up. Shut up.

746
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,390
Will you just--? Just leave us alone.

747
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,550
You asshole!

748
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,390
Why are you still alive?

749
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,390
Why won't you just die already?

750
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,390
Please--

751
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,710
Just-- Just die.

752
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,390
Wagner hasn't had to be

753
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,390
really stellar tonight.

754
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,350
Made solid saves

755
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,350
back in the first period.

756
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,230
You know, Michael, that's probably--

757
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,230
Going back, look at Wagner's numbers,

758
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,470
you know, it seems like he's one

759
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,470
of the last goalies in the league.

760
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,320
They don't wanna

761
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,320
put pressure on this guy.

762
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,240
Kevin Granato looks to make a move,

763
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,240
had the puck taken.

764
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,270
Denver comes back out

765
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,270
the other way.

766
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,830
--by Graham Melanson off Rycroft.

767
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,830
Who else?

768
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,110
Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.

769
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,670
DEA, Albuquerque District Office.

770
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,550
How may I direct your call?

771
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,270
I'd like to speak to the agent

772
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,910
in charge of the Walter White

773
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,910
investigation.

774
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,830
Who may I say is calling?

775
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,550
Walter White.

776
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,990
Hello? Hello?

777
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,630
Sir? Sir, are you still there?

778
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,790
--this is notjust a goalie that's out there,

779
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,790
it's a whole team.

780
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,470
Two forty-nine remaining

781
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,470
in the third period.

782
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,830
You ready for that drink now?

783
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,590
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

784
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,310
You got it.

785
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,150
--and Melanson,

786
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,150
with a good look, makes the save.

787
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,430
That's why you need good, solid

788
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,430
breakout passes.

789
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,070
Matt Peterson-- Win the draw,

790
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,070
Englehart wins the draw,

791
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,070
back to Peterson,

792
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,060
goes behind the net, makes a terrible

793
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,060
breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.

794
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,390
He just winds up, puts it on net here.

795
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,390
Turnovers, turnovers.

796
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,870
When you get turnovers

797
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,870
in the offensive zone, chances happen.

798
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,790
Hopefully it won't happen again.

799
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,030
Turnovers generally--

800
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,350
- I wasn't sure you'd come.

801
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,350
- I'm not staying--

802
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,790
- Is this transfer good on the--?

803
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,790
- Darker than a normal rosé--

804
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,830
For us, it's always been

805
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,830
science first, and--

806
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,030
Wait, would you--? Would you--?

807
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,830
Would you go back,

808
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,830
please?

809
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,750
- ShamWows--

810
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,750
- More of a by-product.

811
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,990
There.

812
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,990
Exactly.

813
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,670
What, this?

814
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,670
Yes.

815
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,790
Butjust yesterday, your charity,

816
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560
the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz

817
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560
Foundation,

818
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,190
announced a $28 million grant

819
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,350
for drug-abuse treatment centers

820
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,350
throughout the Southwest.

821
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,470
Charlie, the Southwest is our home

822
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,560
and we couldn'tjust ignore

823
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,560
what's going on in our own backyard.

824
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,150
But I'm sure you're aware that there

825
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,150
are people who suggest other motives.

826
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,710
Andrew Ross Sorkin

827
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,710
of The New York Times

828
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,030
wrote a column suggesting

829
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,550
that the grant was

830
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,550
a kind of publicity maneuver

831
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,190
to shore up the stock price

832
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,190
of Gray Matter Technologies

833
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,110
because of your association

834
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,110
with Walter White.

835
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,990
That's not exactly the way--

836
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,150
To cleanse yourselves, so to speak,

837
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,670
of having a methamphetamine kingpin

838
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,670
as cofounder of your company.

839
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,030
Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.

840
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,350
I have to believe that

841
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,350
the investing public understands

842
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,790
we're talking about a person

843
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,790
who was there early on,

844
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,950
but who had nothing to do

845
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,950
with the creation of the company

846
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,580
and still less to do with growing it.

847
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,310
So, what was Walter White's

848
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,310
contribution?

849
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,030
You know, to be honest... Honey?

850
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,390
The company name.

851
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,390
The company name.

852
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,280
We came up with it

853
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,280
by combining our names.

854
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,630
"Schwartz" means "black."

855
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,230
Black plus white makes gray.

856
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,230
Hence Gray Matter Technologies.

857
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,180
Exactly. As far as I can recall,

858
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,180
his contribution begins and ends there.

859
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,270
There are continuing reports

860
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,270
of blue methamphetamine,

861
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,070
considered his signature product,

862
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,070
throughout the Southwest

863
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,590
and some evidence

864
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,590
of reaching as far as Europe.

865
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,270
So my question is,

866
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,270
is Walter White still out there?

867
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,470
No, he's not.

868
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,030
You sound very sure.

869
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,470
I am.

870
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,990
I can't speak to this Heisenberg

871
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,990
that people refer to,

872
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,510
but whatever he became,

873
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,590
the sweet, kind, brilliant man

874
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,030
that we once knew long ago,

875
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,030
he's gone.

876
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,660
But to be absolutely clear...

877
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,110
Police! Hands! Show us your hands.

878
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,110
Show us your hands.

879
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,760
What's going on?

880
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,150
Let's see your hands!
