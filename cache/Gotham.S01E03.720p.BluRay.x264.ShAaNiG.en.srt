1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,129
There's a war coming.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,521
A terrible war.
There will be chaos...

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,762
...rivers of blood in the streets,
I know it.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,649
I can see it coming.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,407
It's time. Somebody has to
take over, it might as well be me.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,370
My name's James Gordon. Detective.
I will find the man who did this.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,722
Pepper was framed
by Fish Mooney and the cops.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,531
James Gordon is not a good guy.
You deserve better.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,088
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,763
I spoke with Cobblepot before he died.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,008
Men who are about to die are very honest.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,202
I am gonna kill that old man.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,847
I just wish Penguin was still alive.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,124
I've been watching you.
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,926
Excuse me! Unh.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,451
Hey, yo!

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,250
Come on!

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,169
Come on, move your car!

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,565
- Thank you.
- Hey, somebody took--!

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,966
Stop him!

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,850
You need something?

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,930
Home.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,368
<i>Let's go live for some breaking news.</i>

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,086
<i>I'm coming to you
with the latest wrinkle in a story...</i>

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,680
<i>...that sent shockwaves
through the financial world of Gotham.</i>

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,041
I'm standing before the home
of Ronald Danzer...

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,407
...the man who bilked investors out
of a reported...

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,562
...half billion dollars
in a vast Ponzi scheme.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,007
Danzer is currently out on bail
awaiting trial.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,409
All of them. The judge, the jury, the DA.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,722
Pay them whatever it takes.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,805
I am not going to prison just because a few
dumb bus drivers and stupid old ladies...

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,764
...lost their damn pensions.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,201
Ugh. I gotta sneak out.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,170
Villagers are here with pitchforks.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,084
You're my lawyer.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,526
Fix this.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,569
Balloons.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,684
Balloons?

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,688
Air balloons.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,206
- Want a balloon?
- What? No. No, thank you. No.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,164
Ronald Danzer?

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,886
Who are you?

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,811
Help me!

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,163
That's Ronald Danzer. Roll the camera.
Roll the camera!

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,085
Help me!

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,127
In a bizarre turn of events,
a man appearing to be Ronald Danzer...

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,726
...is rising into the air above Gotham...

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,645
...attached to a weather balloon.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,763
The cart was loaded
with bricks for ballast.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,764
Ronald Danzer cheats half of Gotham
out of their savings...

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,163
...but before he can stand in trial,
a man clips him to a balloon?

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,651
No body?

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,610
- We're calling this a murder?
- Call it a public service.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,286
Danzer was a bum.
He got what he deserved.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,489
I'm gonna go get a Danish.
It's what I deserve.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,407
Damn it!

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,568
Somebody find me O'Brian.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,688
- Get me some ice.
- Yes, sir, lieutenant.

60
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,927
Who the hell are you?

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,731
Jim Gordon.

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,724
Jim Gordon.
Bullock's new partner, right?

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,326
Yeah.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,689
Lieutenant Bill Cranston.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,922
Bullock tells me you're a real boy scout.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,327
Don't think we should be
roughing up the skells?

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,686
They do have their rights.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,128
We'll have to remember that.
Maybe I'll get that tattooed on my ass.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,484
Let me show you something, Gordon.

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,560
This was a gift from the
Gotham Chamber of Commerce...

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,364
...for years of service.

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,681
I call him O'Brian.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,169
He also just happens to be
the best interrogator on the force.

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,808
Nice meeting you, Gordon.

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,523
Oh, Luke! Say hello to Sergeant O'Brian.

76
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,008
No. No.

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,885
I just met Lieutenant Cranston.

78
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,566
- The man, the myth, the legend.
- He's a thug.

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,606
So no fingerprints.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,081
Those carts are too easy to buy or steal
to trace.

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,449
- How you coming on the death threats?
- I thought we talked about this.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,080
Danzer was murdered.
It's our job to catch murderers.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,050
- Guy was a crook.
- Who had not been convicted of any crime.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,647
Tell that to the guys who killed themselves
because he lost their savings.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,485
This guy was living high
while the city kissed his ass...

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,047
...and gave him awards
for being a philanthropist.

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,647
- So we let his killer go free?
- Guy walks in here, holds out his hands...

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,847
...I’ll arrest him.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,048
Otherwise, I'm content justice was served.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,841
- Like with the Waynes? That what you mean?
- Mario Pepper killed the Waynes.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,924
We killed Pepper. That case is closed.

92
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,809
Detective Gordon?

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,449
Davis Lamond from Juvenile Services,
you asked to see Selina Kyle.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,681
Sign for custody.

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,969
When you finish,
bring her to our facility on Water Street.

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
She's scheduled to be transferred upstate
tomorrow.

97
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,890
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.
She has information about an investigation.

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,527
Would you mind stepping back...

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,484
...a bit, please?

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,770
Wait a minute.
Is that one of the kids that was snatched?

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,367
Another closed case.

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,131
What is it about the word "closed"
you don't understand?

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,568
This is something else.
Just read the letters, track the balloons.

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,846
I'll be back in an hour.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,366
Yeah, boss. Get right on it.

106
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,886
Where's my pen?

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,441
So why do you care
who really killed the Waynes?

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,968
Because I wanna see the person responsible
brought to justice.

109
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,208
Did you read that in a book
or something?

110
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,010
And...

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,681
...I made a promise to the boy.

112
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,325
So?

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,490
The killer came from there.

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,966
Took the man's wallet
and the woman's necklace...

115
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,849
...then shot them both.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,809
He left the boy alive.

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,849
I was up there.

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,965
Everybody knows that much.

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,603
Plus, the killer's face was covered.

120
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,401
Not at first. He pulled up his scarf
when he walked toward them.

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,450
- I saw him for a second.
- You saw him? Here? In the dark?

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,170
I can see in the dark.

123
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,651
You don't believe me?

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,680
There's the question
of whether you're lying...

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,763
...and whether you were even here.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,200
You're not giving me proof.

127
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,091
I told you, I stole some chump's wallet
before it happened.

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,607
That was two blocks from here.
Didn't he report it?

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,731
Yes, a man did report his wallet stolen
by a thief that matches your description.

130
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,929
Yes, the timing does work out
to just before the Waynes' murder.

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,289
- But that does not place you here.
- I dumped the wallet.

132
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,051
There.

133
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,082
A sewer. Great.

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,409
It's not that I don't trust you
not to run away, but, well...

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
...I don't.

136
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,205
You find the wallet, you let me go?
That's the deal?

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,407
No.

138
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,166
I find the wallet, that places you here.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,448
- I still have to find the guy.
- That's bull.

140
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,806
That's the deal.

141
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,325
Great.

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,487
Son of a bitch. She was telling the truth.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,526
Oh, detective.

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,005
You're gonna need these.

145
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,768
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

146
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,129
Lazlo, honey...

147
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,490
...take a rest.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,085
Poor thing.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,130
Well, well, well.

150
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,045
Detectives Montoya and Allen.

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,486
To what do I owe this honor?

152
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,769
Thought we'd pay our respects.

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,691
Maybe ask if you've seen
your friend Cobblepot around.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,241
Oswald. Hmm.

155
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,121
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him.

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,123
Isn't that funny?

157
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,363
Almost as funny as two detectives
from Major Crimes...

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,881
...looking for a nobody like Oswald.

159
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,008
Can we stop the dance?

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,003
He's dead. Isn't he?

161
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,607
Killed because he told us about Pepper
being framed for the Wayne murders.

162
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,171
He's dead.

163
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,801
But I didn't kill the little Snitch.

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,644
Word is...

165
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,370
...Jim Gordon pulled the trigger.

166
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,249
You have proof?

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,402
What do I look like? A cop?

168
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,205
I only heard that James Gordon
splattered poor Oswald's brains...

169
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,885
...all over Gotham River.

170
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,010
Why would Gordon
wanna murder Cobblepot?

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,730
Just to keep him quiet about the frame?

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,009
Wrong question, gorgeous.

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,127
Jim Gordon pulled the trigger,
but who gave the order?

174
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,842
Who can make a cop commit
cold-blooded murder?

175
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,485
Falcone.

176
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,607
Your deductive powers astonish me.

177
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,411
Honestly, I just got a chill.

178
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,164
There's a rumor going around...

179
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,405
...that Falcone gave your latest boy-toy
a nasty beating.

180
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,327
You wouldn't be looking for revenge,
would you?

181
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,246
I just want justice for little Oswald.

182
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,969
Hey, Cobblepot.

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,890
You're supposed to be dead.

184
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,723
I'm afraid
you have me confused. My name is Dimitri.

185
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,804
No, I heard you got whacked for ratting.

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,566
Fish is gonna pay some serious cash
for your skinny ass.

187
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,882
No. Please. Please, she'll kill me!

188
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,724
Why'd you even come back, huh?

189
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,281
I could not stay away.
Gotham is my home.

190
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,364
It's my destiny.
You don't see what's coming. I do.

191
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,329
Gotham needs me. I'm its future.

192
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,721
If you're its future,
then Gotham is in trouble.

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,649
Yes. Yes, it is.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,170
Can I have a tuna sandwich, please?

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,962
- Alfred, I don't wanna do this.
- What?

196
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,766
- Stop, I don't wanna do this.
- Come on, swat.

197
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,371
<i>En garde.</i>

198
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,807
Here we go, son.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,925
- What? What? Shall we go?
- I don't want to do this.

200
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,366
What?

201
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,409
There she blows.

202
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,282
Eye of the tiger through the wind
in your nostrils, Sir Bruce.

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,410
The blood in his veins.

204
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,807
Sink. Mind your head. Dive!

205
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,691
Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir, I--

206
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,649
That's gotta hurt. No, not really.

207
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,246
I said, stop!

208
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

209
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,687
Stop. Down swords. I surrender.

210
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,086
See? A nice...

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,569
...swordfight...

212
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,007
...gets our blood up, doesn't it?

213
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,529
Better than reading these dusty old files.

214
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,290
What is this, anyway?

215
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
Police file.

216
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,163
Your mom and dad.
How did you get these?

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,005
It wasn't hard.

218
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,084
Why would you wanna look at these?
They're horrible.

219
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,844
They're gonna give you nightmares.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,810
I have those anyway and...

221
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,121
...I'm looking for clues.

222
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,606
So you're a detective now?

223
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,001
- If I find a clue, I am.
- Have you found a clue?

224
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,928
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

225
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,330
Detective Gordon has promised you...

226
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,371
...that he will find the person that killed--
- You really believe he will?

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,763
He will try.

228
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,490
Of that I'm certain.

229
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,610
Yeah, Detective James Gordon.

230
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,560
One of your counselors brought me a
girl this morning and I signed for custody.

231
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,563
That's what I'm saying,
I can't bring her back, she got away.

232
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,090
Yeah? Well, I'm not happy about it, either.

233
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,083
On edge, Gordon?

234
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,411
I'm fine. How can I help you?

235
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,131
We were just, uh, wondering...

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,683
...when you shot Cobblepot in the head
and dumped his body in the river...

237
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,171
...did Falcone pay?

238
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,563
Or was that more of a
"favor to the don" type thing?

239
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,282
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

240
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,841
Oh, so you mean
you didn't kill Cobblepot?

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,843
Or you didn't do it for Falcone?

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,129
We thought we'd give you
a chance to tell us the truth. Cop to cop.

243
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,011
You're not listening. I didn't kill him.

244
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,050
Okay, so where were you
on the night of September the 17th?

245
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,248
Are you really asking me this?

246
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,323
Since when did Major Crimes
become IA?

247
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,323
When cops started doing hits
for the mob.

248
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,165
Yeah? Then come back to me
when you have actual proof.

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,368
Until then, don't waste my time.

250
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,330
Hey, Gordon, piece of advice.
Take a shower.

251
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,960
Because you stink like a sewer.

252
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,484
- Any job at all, even dishwasher.
- We're staffed up.

253
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,082
I only ask a chance to prove myself.

254
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,925
- You ever work in a restaurant?
- Not exactly.

255
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,971
Here, you're on your feet all day.
You don't even have the right shoes.

256
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,049
There you are. We got the owner
of a balloon factory downstairs.

257
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,325
- Says he's got something for us.
- Montoya and Allen came by.

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,081
- They accused me of killing Cobblepot.
- Damn.

259
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,163
- Somebody must've talked.
- Doesn't matter.

260
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,096
The fact they're here means they got
nothing and they're gonna get nothing.

261
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,124
End of the day,
no one cares about Cobblepot.

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,887
- Because he deserved it? Like Danzer?
- Don't make this into something bigger.

263
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,681
You did what you had to do,
and he did deserve it, he worked for Fish.

264
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,205
She doesn't employ altar boys.

265
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,601
What about Mario Pepper?
He deserve what he got?

266
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,807
Hell, yes.

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,964
He was a dirtbag for trying to shoot you.
Remember?

268
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,088
I thought we were done talking about this.

269
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,050
We're done talking about this...

270
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,727
...when the person who actually murdered
Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail.

271
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,882
Not the person we killed for it.

272
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,088
For the last time, Gordon...

273
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,169
...let it go.
- Or what?

274
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,445
Am I gonna be the next person taken out
to the pier to get a bullet in the head?

275
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,849
The interview's waiting.

276
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,725
Pardon me.

277
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,565
You work at that Italian restaurant,
don't you?

278
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah.

279
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,567
And what size are your shoes?

280
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,810
Uh, nines.

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,122
What a coincidence!

282
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,566
When I saw that balloon go up on TV,
I knew it was mine.

283
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,803
I said to myself, "Jimmy boy,
you better call the cops right away.

284
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,644
Or they'll try and pin this on you."

285
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,131
So it was you who called us?

286
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,329
I thought my partner had gone
to the trouble of tracking you down.

287
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,404
How exactly was your balloon
used to kill Ronald Danzer?

288
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,843
It was stolen
by my bum of an ex-employee a month ago.

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,445
Carl Smikers.

290
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,329
That's what I get for hiring a kid.

291
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,000
- Did he ever mention Danzer?
- Hell, no.

292
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,487
I'm surprised
if he even knew who Danzer was.

293
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,487
We ain't talking about one of those
intellectually superior types here.

294
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,688
- You got an address?
- Yeah, you find him...

295
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,241
...see you can get back the others.
- The other what?

296
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,771
The other balloons.

297
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,922
A grand a pop those things are.

298
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,684
He stole four.

299
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,451
Forty-seven dollars?

300
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,082
Frankie, I'm coming back next week,
try to show some initiative, all right?

301
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,402
Okay, Bill.

302
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,921
You're a disgrace to drug dealers.

303
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,288
- Hot dog?
- Get lost.

304
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,010
- Hot dog?
- I said, get lost!

305
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,730
Lieutenant Cranston?

306
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,091
All right.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,850
Let's see.

308
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,204
Let's see what we got here.

309
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,644
What the hell?

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,604
Who are you?

311
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,649
Oh, no.

312
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,520
Right.

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,682
So no breakfast then.

314
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,804
And no dinner last night.

315
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,604
What's the new program?

316
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,804
You wanna see how long we can go
without eating anything?

317
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,964
Well, if that's the case,
I should save myself the trouble...

318
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,407
...of making it.

319
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,126
Have you seen this?

320
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,525
Oh, yeah, nuts are going around
offing people with balloons.

321
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,770
Can think of easier ways to kill someone.

322
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,449
Master Bruce, forgive me for...

323
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,161
...uttering the tired old words
"in times like these."

324
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,729
But in times like these...

325
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,768
...you really need to keep
your strength up.

326
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,483
I'm just not hungry.

327
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,324
Morning.

328
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,567
Hi.

329
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,960
Thank you.

330
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,442
- I tried not to wake you.
- It's fine. I have a meeting.

331
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,204
You Okay?

332
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,684
You hardly slept last night.

333
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,361
- It's just work.
- This Balloonman thing?

334
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,928
That's what the paper's calling him.

335
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,365
And it says he killed a cop.

336
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,690
You're not in danger, are you?

337
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,804
You don't have to worry about me.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,368
Well, what is it then?
I can see somethings bothering you.

339
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,521
Yesterday...

340
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,808
...our first victim, Ronald Danzer...

341
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,850
...he was a con man. Nobody cared.

342
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,402
Now that a cop's been targeted...

343
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,080
...the investigation
will get all the support it needs.

344
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,366
It's not right.

345
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,961
Everyone has to matter
or nobody matters.

346
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,248
Otherwise people lose faith...

347
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,363
...and that's when you get vigilantes.

348
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,522
But that isn't your fault.

349
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,081
I mean, if anything,
you're giving people faith.

350
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,241
Am I? How?

351
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,484
Your first case,
you caught the Wayne killer.

352
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
Do you have any idea what that meant
for the city?

353
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,891
You're a hero.

354
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,166
I gotta go.

355
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,167
<i>Don't matter if you a cop, you dirty,
The Balloonman gonna get you.</i>

356
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,450
<i>It's time the people of Gotham realize
that they have to stand up for themselves.</i>

357
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,604
<i>Hey, Balloonman ought to get
to my landlord next.</i>

358
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,604
<i>He's a crook.
And his name is Harold--</i>

359
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,961
This is wonderful. This is like my dream
of how today was gonna go.

360
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,165
Besides the black eye to the department,
now we have a vigilante who kills bad cops.

361
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,847
- Cranston wasn't that bad.
- But whatever he was or wasn't guilty of...

362
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,327
...Cranston was a lieutenant
in the G.C.P.D.

363
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,642
You don't get to go around killing cops.

364
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,842
Where are you on this
in the Danzer murder?

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,968
We're looking for a man
named Carl Smikers.

366
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,124
He was an employee at the factory
where the balloons were stolen.

367
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,727
We have uniforms staking out his apartment,
but he hasn't been back there.

368
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,928
- And you like him for this?
- Oh, he's guilty.

369
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,776
Leave me in a room with him,
he'll be guilty.

370
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,802
He's connected,
but I'm not sure he's the one.

371
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,121
He had weather balloons.

372
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,960
Cranston and Danzer were killed
with weather balloons. He's the guy.

373
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,726
Smikers never graduated high school.
He's never held a job for more than a year.

374
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,042
He's got busts for soliciting.
Possession.

375
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,689
- Tell her about the other balloons.
- What other balloons?

376
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,080
Smikers' boss mentioned...

377
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,961
...that four balloons are missing.
There are two of them still out there.

378
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,128
So two more targets?

379
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,964
We have any sense who they might be?

380
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,962
Danzer and Cranston were both known
figures, and known to be dirty.

381
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,726
Killer didn't need any special knowledge
to target them.

382
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,168
So it's likely the next target
is public and known to be corrupt.

383
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,563
Basically every elected official in Gotham
should stay indoors.

384
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,650
Find him.

385
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,768
- Now.
- We will.

386
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,124
We Will?

387
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,087
What happened to
the killer doing the city a favor?

388
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,322
You're gonna make me think
you actually care.

389
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,608
You wanna kill a crook-financier,
be my guest.

390
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,001
You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.

391
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,247
We need a plan.

392
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,722
Relax, one thing I do know
is how to find someone.

393
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,960
Beautiful, baby.

394
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,805
Hey.

395
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,647
Hey. Yo.

396
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,290
What did he tell you?

397
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,889
Nothing. I was just hungry. Mm. Mm.

398
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,201
You wash dishes,
mop the floor, take out the trash.

399
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,486
Otherwise...

400
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,244
...you're deaf, dumb and blind.

401
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,483
- I understand--
- No. You don't. But you will.

402
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,331
This ain't like other places,
and you'll either get it...

403
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,085
Or I'll be fired?

404
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,091
You could say that.

405
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,049
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

406
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,601
I know that this is a great opportunity--

407
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,842
Don Maroni.

408
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,806
Good to see you.

409
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,965
Great opportunity indeed.

410
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,370
Our suspect had a prior for soliciting
two years ago, right?

411
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,206
One of my girls said he looked familiar,
remembered he liked big, brawny types.

412
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,967
She pointed me to that pimp,
that guy who specialized in that.

413
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,691
- He remembered...
- After you roughed him up a little.

414
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,408
...that he used to do deliveries
for this, uh, dry cleaner, Mr. Chang...

415
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,927
...he remembered the guy
was a mahjong nut.

416
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,367
He was into these Chinese bookies
for five grand.

417
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,607
And they sent you here?

418
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,446
By way of bike messengers, a guy that
runs some pickpockets on the south side...

419
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,723
...and a pot sticker joint
the guy apparently loves.

420
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,488
Dragon Palace.

421
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,888
- We didn't order any--
- Carl Smikers?

422
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,966
Run!

423
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,884
G.C.P.D! You're under arrest!

424
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,205
Don't move!

425
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,527
Don't move.

426
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,082
Jim, a little help!

427
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,006
Put it down!

428
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,647
Put it down now!

429
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,289
You put the MCU on
to that cop killing Oswald.

430
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,969
Falcone finds out it came from you,
I-- I mean...

431
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,766
...I don't mind what he did to me.
It's, uh--

432
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,843
Lazlo, honey...

433
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,168
...you're worried about me, aren't you?

434
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,726
But you must remember...

435
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,089
...it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt...

436
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,083
...it was me.

437
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,131
Understand?

438
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,730
Good.

439
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,049
The boy has lost his spine.

440
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,490
Not everyone is built
for a beating like that.

441
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,160
What's that new piece
that the Roman has been seeing?

442
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,482
What's her name? Natalia? Nadia?

443
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,404
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

444
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,291
Tell Butch
she's going to have an accident.

445
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,890
Such a shame.

446
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,162
She was a pretty girl.

447
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,882
And get rid of Lazlo while you're at it.

448
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,565
He's bringing down the mood.

449
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,764
With pleasure.

450
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,241
- My God.
- Sorry.

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,880
- I knocked but I could hear someone--
- How did you get in?

452
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,362
- I still have a key, remember?
- And you just let yourself in?

453
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,249
Give it to me.

454
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,767
I could have you arrested.

455
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,130
Or I could arrest you.

456
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,521
Anyway, it's kind of early to get high,
isn't it?

457
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,842
It's been a stressful day.

458
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,124
- Is that all you're doing?
- I'm afraid so.

459
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,327
Disappointed?

460
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,084
Don't play with me, Barbara.

461
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,605
I was there, remember?

462
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,366
- Through all of it.
- You mean you're part of it?

463
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,085
Fine.

464
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,687
- Answer the question.
- Yes.

465
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,887
This is it.

466
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,849
Now that you've broken into my home...

467
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,651
...and accused me of being a drug addict,
you can leave.

468
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,370
Not until we talk about Gordon.

469
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,761
- He's killed a man.
- You told me. It's not true.

470
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,809
Not Mario Pepper. Another man.

471
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,770
And he killed him on the orders
of Carmine Falcone...

472
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,763
...biggest crime boss in Gotham.

473
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,649
You're lying.

474
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,322
But you know,
I guess I should be used to that.

475
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,244
True.

476
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,243
When we were together,
I did lie to you.

477
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,365
A lot.

478
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,727
But you always knew.

479
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,405
You looked in my eyes...

480
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,961
...and you knew when I was lying to you.

481
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,848
Am I lying now?

482
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,167
Is this just because I love him?

483
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Is that why you are so determined
to destroy him?

484
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,691
I've been sober for a year and I know
that doesn't erase the things that I did...

485
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,881
...but I still care about you.

486
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,011
I can't stand you being with this man.

487
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,288
You deserve better.

488
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,046
Leave.

489
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,810
Now.

490
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,523
Ask him where he was the night
that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

491
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,688
That's the name of the man he killed.

492
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,008
I'm telling the truth. I didn't kill those
guys. I mean, a cop? Why would I kill a cop?

493
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,130
Maybe because you're a thieving,
cop-murdering pile of crap.

494
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,163
But mind you, that's just a theory.

495
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,722
- You admit stealing the balloons?
- Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks.

496
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,491
And if I didn't pay them,
they were gonna cut off stuff.

497
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,366
If you didn't kill Danzer and Cranston,
who did?

498
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,330
- Who did you sell the balloons to?
- I never saw his face.

499
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,965
We had a drop off point
to exchange the balloons and money.

500
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,724
You know what we got here, Jim?

501
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,565
We got us a criminal mastermind.

502
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,087
Not only is the murder weapon
in the stratosphere...

503
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,567
...but so are the bodies.
It's the perfect crime.

504
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,044
The bodies will come back.

505
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
What are you talking about?

506
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,401
You guys not know
how weather balloons work?

507
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,325
Tell us, genius.
Or I'll beat it out of you.

508
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,323
Wait-- Okay, they rise up...

509
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,848
...and it gets colder and colder,
and the balloon gets brittle...

510
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,411
...and the helium expands.

511
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,641
Then what?

512
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,491
It pops.

513
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm really starting to dislike this case.

514
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,810
Where do you think
they find shovels that big, huh?

515
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,481
We only have to worry about
one more balloon.

516
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,883
- Who?
- Quinn. He's meditating in his garden.

517
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,764
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

518
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,763
We're gonna have the church
on our back.

519
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,246
Great. Forget the fact...

520
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,801
...that Quinn was known
as "the diddling priest."

521
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,002
Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.
What wasn't smashed to bits.

522
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,085
Why is your name on this, Jim?

523
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,851
I know who the Balloonman is.

524
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,680
You see,
Falcone is only the boss of Gotham...

525
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,968
...because people believe he's the boss.

526
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,851
That's what this Arkham thing
is gonna change.

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,004
People are gonna see
that the emperor's got no clothes.

528
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,644
I'm wasting my breath.
You're an idiot. Get out of here.

529
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,201
Who the hell are you?

530
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,124
I-- I'm sorry, sir. I am--

531
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,328
Hold on. Put that down.

532
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,050
You were listening, huh?

533
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,123
You're new. What's your name?

534
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,921
Paolo, sir.

535
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,242
Italian? You don't look Italian.

536
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,445
On my mother's side.

537
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,210
It's the side that I claim.

538
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,044
A boy who loves his mother.

539
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,887
Here. Take it.

540
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,491
I was a lot like you.

541
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,404
Started from nothing.

542
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,848
But I kept my head down, I worked hard,
now look at me.

543
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,447
Gotham is the city of opportunity.

544
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,648
Yes, sir. I believe that too.

545
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,689
You hear what I was saying back there?

546
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,003
Those names? Falcone. Arkham.

547
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,686
They mean anything to you?

548
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,123
Honestly, sir,
I didn't hear anything at all.

549
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,805
Attaboy.

550
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,402
<i>The Balloonman has struck once again.</i>

551
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,484
<i>Cardinal Quinn, accused of
multiple accounts of sexual abuse...</i>

552
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,411
<i>...is the latest victim of the vigilante.</i>

553
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,604
See this? This is not good.

554
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,081
You can't go around killing priests.

555
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,649
At least not in public.

556
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,843
Go take care of your mother, Paolo.

557
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,923
<i>His name is Davis Lamond, 48.</i>

558
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,481
He's worked at Juvenile Services
for 15 years.

559
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,246
No priors.
He didn't show up at work today.

560
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,131
And he hasn't been back to his apartment.

561
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,085
- We have uniforms in both.
- You're positive he's the killer?

562
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,801
We found a form on Cranston's body
that I've given Lamond yesterday morning.

563
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,962
Also, keys that opened
Lamond's apartment.

564
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,369
I'm guessing they had a scuffle.
Cranston went through his pockets...

565
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,887
...but Lamond managed
to attach him to the balloon.

566
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,008
What caused Lamond to snap?

567
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,810
Not sure.

568
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,806
Lamond's coworkers describe him
as thoughtful, dedicated, sweet.

569
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,007
A few said that.

570
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,925
Great, one of those
sweet cop-killing vigilantes.

571
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,926
- What about his last target?
- Same profile as all the rest.

572
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,686
Well-known. Seemingly respectable.

573
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,966
Actually corrupt.

574
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,482
This is Gotham.
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

575
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,768
Meanwhile,
I have the mayor, city council...

576
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,531
...half the city's judges
and clergy hiding indoors...

577
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,967
...screaming at the commissioner
to find the guy.

578
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,246
Guess who he screams at?

579
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,483
We've got his photo out there.
It's just a matter of time.

580
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,129
- Nothing.
- Really?

581
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,887
Your network of Chinese loan sharks
and hookers came up empty?

582
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,168
Gloat later. Just think about it.

583
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,609
He had to store the balloons, the helium
canisters, the carts he was using...

584
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,926
Maybe a storage facility, a warehouse?

585
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,128
Or an abandoned building.

586
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,322
That's it? How'd you come up with that?

587
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,005
It's the same thing I just said.

588
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,329
What made you figure this place?

589
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,690
The girl yesterday, Selina, she told
me she was in a new juvie building.

590
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,804
Lamond, the counselor, said the same thing.
So I'm thinking:

591
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,042
What happened to the old juvie building?

592
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,885
Turns out,
the city's getting ready to demo it.

593
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,327
Even if he was here,
he's probably long gone.

594
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,484
He's only got one balloon left.
He knows we're closing in...

595
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,041
Or that's him right there.

596
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,411
Bullock!

597
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,926
Drop the gun now!

598
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,681
- I can't do that, detective, I'm not done yet.
- One more time, drop it.

599
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,080
- You should be helping me.
- You're wasting your breath.

600
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,731
My partner thinks
you're as bad as the scum you kill.

601
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,322
Me, I can see how you're doing us a favor,
so don't shoot me, all right?

602
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,369
You believe as I do.

603
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,807
You're the one
who caught those child snatchers.

604
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,928
- You risked your life.
- So did I.

605
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,924
You wanna protect the innocent?

606
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,048
Yes, we have laws for that.

607
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,361
And what good are laws...

608
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,007
...when they require men like your
Lieutenant Cranston to implement them?

609
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,849
And Ronald Danzer? You think he would
have seen the inside of a jail?

610
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,161
Or that priest?

611
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,328
Why didn't the law punish him?

612
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,610
I have given my life...

613
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,162
...to the lost children of Gotham
because I wanted to make a difference.

614
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,085
You know what kind of difference I made?
None.

615
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,529
Because the people running this city feed
off the weak, and the law protects them.

616
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,561
When your mayor rounded up all those children
to send off to that prison upstate...

617
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,364
...I decided no more.

618
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,091
I would teach them
there are consequences.

619
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,126
So why don't you ask yourself, detective.

620
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,203
Who are you fighting for?

621
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,967
A mayor in the mob's pocket,
cops on the take...

622
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,600
...or for the weak and the innocent?

623
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,931
Who are you finally?

624
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,051
Forget it.

625
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,684
No, no! Aah!

626
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,808
- What are you doing?
- How do you like that?

627
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,365
- Grab him!
- How does it feel...

628
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,409
...you're hoisted by your own petard?

629
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,166
No, Jim!

630
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,488
Jim, what are you doing?

631
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,801
Jim, let go!

632
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,691
- Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!
- Jim!

633
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,726
- Let go!
- Shoot it!

634
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,325
Just let go!

635
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,965
Shoot it now!

636
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,690
Carmine.

637
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,882
What a lovely surprise.

638
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,644
We're not quite open.

639
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,887
But for you...

640
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,123
Hello, Fish.
Just stopped by on my way to dinner.

641
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,886
I wanted to make sure
there were no hard feelings.

642
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,365
Never.

643
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,161
That's my girl.

644
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,924
Speaking of your girl, that'd better be
the reason why you're ditching me tonight.

645
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,686
What's her name again? Nadia?

646
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,451
Natalia.

647
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,523
And no. She had an accident.

648
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,285
I hope nothing serious.

649
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,806
A mugging.

650
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,803
Mugging?

651
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,322
Ever since the Waynes were killed,
the city has gone crazy.

652
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,086
I hope the punk who did it
paid with his life.

653
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,686
He will, when we find him.

654
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,803
Along with anyone who helped him.

655
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,251
Are you hearing any rumblings
from Maroni's camp?

656
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,121
You don't actually believe that Maroni
had something to do with it, do you?

657
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,806
Like you say...

658
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,291
...people are acting crazy...

659
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,084
...and crazy is bad for business.

660
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,368
Especially with everything
on the horizon.

661
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,006
You're talking about Arkham.

662
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,162
I thought you had that locked up.

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,048
Keep your eyes open.

664
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,964
Hold on.

665
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,244
Give me a second.

666
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,400
There will be more like me, detective.

667
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,565
You know that, don't you?

668
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,848
Not if we do our job.

669
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,528
And We Will. I Will.

670
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,609
You had your chance.

671
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,649
All of you.

672
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,610
Who was your last target?

673
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,050
The crusade of the vigilante known
as The Balloonman ended...

674
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,969
...when he was apprehended by police.

675
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,767
<i>He was the man who stood up to the
corruption eating at the heart of Gotham...</i>

676
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,207
<i>...willing to break the law
in order to save it.</i>

677
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,046
I'd imagine the criminals of Gotham
are sleeping well tonight.

678
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,686
He killed people.

679
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,804
That made him a criminal too.

680
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,883
That's very true.

681
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,445
Can I get you anything else?

682
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,130
No, thank you, Alfred.

683
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,568
Right, well, you know...

684
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,371
Do try and eat a bit, won't you?

685
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,489
Be a shame to have you floating away.

686
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,247
<i>G.C.P.D. claims a win,
but this journalist is left to wonder...</i>

687
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,411
<i>...now that The Balloonman is gone,
who will defend the people of Gotham?</i>

688
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,443
<i>This is Channel 7 at 7 reporting</i> live...

689
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,922
<i>...from the former Gotham
Juvenile Facility Center in downtown...</i>

690
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,929
<i>...with your minute-to-minute update.</i>

691
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,282
<i>Back to the newsroom, John.</i>

692
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,209
You're okay.

693
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,767
Are you okay?

694
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,361
Yeah. I fell, that's all. I'm fine.

695
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,643
What's wrong?

696
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,722
I want you to know
that you can tell me anything.

697
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,725
The city is sick.

698
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,284
Sick in a way I hadn't realized.

699
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,602
When they were taking him away,
this Balloonman killer...

700
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,842
...I asked who his last target was.

701
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,249
You know what he said?

702
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,769
"Doesn't matter."

703
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,811
He meant the mayor, judges,
anyone in a position of power...

704
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,007
...they're all guilty.

705
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,848
But that's not true.

706
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,210
That's how he feels.
That's how they all feel. Everyone.

707
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,280
That's why the city embraced him.

708
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,001
Because we let them down.

709
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,051
But if people take the law
into their own hands...

710
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,123
...then there is no law.

711
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,849
And we're lost.

712
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,211
There are cops who do it.

713
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,844
Same thing he did.

714
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,481
But you never would.

715
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,802
Do you think I could?

716
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,085
No.

717
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,329
I know you...

718
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,443
...Jim Gordon.

719
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,450
And I love you.

720
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,401
And now I'm gonna get you a drink.

721
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,645
I'll get it.

722
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,970
Jim?

723
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,242
Hello, James...

724
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,210
...old friend.
