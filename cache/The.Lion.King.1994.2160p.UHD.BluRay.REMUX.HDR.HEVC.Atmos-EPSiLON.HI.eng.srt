King Mufasa's on his way,

You've made me lose my lunch.

You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,462

- Mm-hmm?

00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,384
Drop him.

00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,721
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

83
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,165
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

84
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,253
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

85
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:24,300
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,094
I shall practice my curtsy!

87
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,764
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

88
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:31,140
Oh, no, Mufasa.

89
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,101

turn your back on me.

(ROARS)

91
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,104

Temper, temper.

93
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,943
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

94
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,945
Pity. Why not?

95
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,323
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

96
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,785
But when it comes to brute strength,

97
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

98
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,378
There's one in every family, sire.

99
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,004
Two in mine, actually,

100
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,216
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

101
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,301
What am I going to do with him?

102
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,136
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

103
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,304
Zazu!

104
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,807
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

105
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,976
you could take him out and beat him.

MUFASA: Look, Simba.

122
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,461
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

123
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,254
Wow.

124
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:12,259
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

125
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,305
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

126
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,809
and will rise with you as the new king.

127
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,603
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

128
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,606
Everything the light touches.

129
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,817
What about that shadowy place?

130
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,027
That's beyond our borders.

131
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,487
You must never go there, Simba.

132
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,656
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

133
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,118
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

134
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,495
- There's more?
- (LAUGHS) Simba...

135
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,670
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

136
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,673
As king, you need to
understand that balance

137
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,508
and respect all the creatures,

138
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,469
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

139
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,346
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

140
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,015
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

141
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,060
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

142
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,855
and the antelope eat the grass.

143
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:11,193
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

144
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,529
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

145
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,448
Checking in with the morning report.

146
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,574
Fire away.

147
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,367
Well! The buzz from the bees

148
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,327
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

149
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,495
Really?

150
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,914
What are you doing, son?

151
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,541
Pouncing.

152
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,960
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

153
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,005
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

154
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,882
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

155
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,109
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

156
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,801
Stay low to the ground.

157
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,219
Cheetahs never prosper...

158
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,406
(WHISPERING) Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

159
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,699
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

160
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,933
Very good. Pouncing.

161
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,437
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

162
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,231
This is so humiliating.

163
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,900
Try not to make a sound.

164
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,235
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

165
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,572
Mufasa? Simba?

166
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,992
(MUFASA LAUGHS)

167
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,660
That's very good.

168
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,579
- Zazu!
- Yes!

169
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,290
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

170
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,668
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

171
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,253
Zazu, take Simba home.

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,463
Aw, dad, can't I come?

173
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,672
No, son.

174
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,926
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

175
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,096
Oh, young master,
one day, you will be king.

176
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,059
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

177
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,186
from dawn until dusk.

178
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,612
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

179
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,782
I despise guessing games.

180
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,951
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

181
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,245
Oh, goody!

182
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,121
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

183
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,208
and I'm gonna rule it all!

184
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,795
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

185
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,172
Bad back, you know.

186
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,341
Hey, Uncle Scar.

187
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,802
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

188
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,137
A monkey's uncle.

189
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,016
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,311
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

191
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,437
Everything.

192
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,108
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

193
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,653
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

194
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,738
And he's absolutely right.

195
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,156
It's far too dangerous.

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,659
Only the bravest lions go there.

197
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,412
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

198
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,872
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

199
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,040
Why not?

200
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favorite nephew.

201
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,506
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

202
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,092
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

203
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,388
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

204
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,099
An elephant what? Whoa!

205
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,311
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

206
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,230
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

207
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,317
you being so clever and all.

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,110
Just do me one favor.

209
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:02,781
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

210
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,283
No problem.

211
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,993
There's a good lad.

212
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,829
You run along now and have fun.

213
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,414
And remember,

214
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:13,000
it's our little secret.

215
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

216
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,345
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

217
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,972
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

218
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,099
SARABI: And it's time for yours.

219
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,227
Mom!

220
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,189
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

221
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,068
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

222
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,444
So, where are we going?

223
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,071
It better not be anyplace dumb.

224
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,989
No, it's really cool.

225
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,575
So, where is this really cool place?

226
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,077
Oh.

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,829
- Uh, around the water hole.
- The water hole?

228
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,706
What's so great about the water hole?

229
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,958
I'll show you when we get there.

230
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh.

231
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,128
Uh, mom, can I go with Simba?

232
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,464
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

233
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:01,590
Well...

234
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,092
BOTH: Please?

235
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,301
It's all right with me.

236
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,469
- Yeah!
- All right!

237
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,471
As long as Zazu goes with you.

238
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,139
No, not Zazu.

239
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,766
ZAZU: Step lively.

240
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,812
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

241
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,772
So, where are we really going?

242
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,232
An elephant graveyard.

243
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,358
Wow!

244
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,943
Shh! Zazu.

245
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,737
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

246
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,657
Oh, just look at you two.

247
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,868
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

248
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,162
Your parents will be thrilled,

249
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,623
what with your being betrothed and all.

250
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,749
Be-what?

251
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,543
Betrothed. Intended.

252
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,545
Affianced.

253
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,671
Meaning...

254
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,757
One day, you two are
going to be married.

255
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,883
- Yuck!
- Eww!

256
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,177
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

257
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,471
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

258
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,473
Sorry to bust your bubble,

259
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,184
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

260
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,729
It's a tradition going back generations.

261
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,356
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

262
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,276
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

263
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,778
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

264
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,447
Well, he's the future king.

265
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,907
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

266
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:10,451
Not yet, I don't.

267
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,994
And with an attitude like that,

268
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,873
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

269
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,541
Not the way I see it.

270
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,711
(SINGING) <i>I'm gonna be a mighty king</i>

271
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>So enemies beware</i>

272
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,549
<i>Well, I've never seen
a king of beasts</i>

273
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>With quite so little hair</i>

274
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,512
<i>I'm gonna be the main event</i>

275
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,639
<i>Like no king was before</i>

276
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,350
<i>I'm brushin' up on lookin' down</i>

277
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,561
<i>I'm workin' on my roar</i>

278
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,273
<i>Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing</i>

279
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,236
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

280
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,490
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

281
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,909
<i>- No one sayin', "Do this"
- Now, when I said that...</i>

282
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,411
<i>- No one saying, "Be there"
- What I meant was...</i>

283
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,830
<i>- No one sayin', "Stop that"
- You don't realize...</i>

284
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,750
<i>- No one sayin', "See here"
- Now, see here!</i>

285
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,170
<i>Free to run around all day</i>

286
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,838
Well, that's definitely out.

287
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,926
<i>Free to do it all my way</i>

288
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,264
<i>I think it's time that you and I</i>

289
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,391
<i>Arranged a heart-to-heart</i>

290
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,268
<i>Kings don't need advice</i>

291
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,896
<i>From little hornbills for a start</i>

292
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>if this is where
the monarchy is headed</i>

293
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,734
<i>Count me out</i>

294
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>Out of service, out of Africa</i>

295
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,906
<i>I wouldn't hang about</i>

296
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,327
<i>This child is getting
wildly out of wing</i>

297
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,873
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

298
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,179
<i>Everybody, look left</i>

299
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
<i>Everybody, look right</i>

300
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>Everywhere you look, I'm</i>

301
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>Standing in the spotlight</i>

302
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,146
Not yet!

303
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,984
<i>Let every creature
go for broke and sing</i>

304
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,946
<i>Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing</i>

305
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling</i>

306
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:21,665
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

307
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:26,587
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

308
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,508
<i>Oh, I just can't wait</i>

309
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,845
<i>To be king</i>

310
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,812
ZAZU: (MUFFLED)
I beg your pardon, madam, but

311
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,898
get off!

312
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,566
Simba?

313
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,860
Nala!

314
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:52,237
(LAUGHING)

315
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,655
All right! It worked!

316
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,241
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

317
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,368
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

318
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,621
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

319
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,664
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

320
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,962
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

321
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,757
(LAUGHING)

322
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,844
Pinned ya again.

323
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,567
This is it. We made it.

324
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,365
Whoa!

325
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,786
NALA: It's really creepy.

326
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,954
Yeah.

327
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,288
Isn't it great?

328
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,500
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

329
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,711
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

330
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,672
There's only one way to know.

331
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,548
Come on, let's go check it out.

332
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,302
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

Oh, man!

It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,

337
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:09,272
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

338
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,774
Danger? Ha!

339
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,901
I walk on the wild side.

340
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,237
I laugh in the face of danger.

Just what I was thinking.

348
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,884
A trio of trespassers!

349
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,220
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

350
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,139
A simple navigational error.

351
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,182
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

352
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:48,228
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

353
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,647
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

357

Huh! You can't do anything to me.

358

Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

you put Nala in danger.

647
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:13,697
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

648
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,200
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

649
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,536
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

650
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,081
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

651
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,333
Maybe he'll be on our side.

652
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,461
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

653
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,839
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

654
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,218
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

655
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,386
So we're keeping him?

656
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,721
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

657
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,431
- Uh...
- My point exactly.

658
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:42,810
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

659
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,612
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

660
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,947
You nearly died.

661
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,657
- I saved you.

662
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,909
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

663
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,828
Thanks for your help.

664
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:03,288
Hey, where you going?

665
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,582
Nowhere.

666
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,000
Gee, he looks blue.

667
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:11,380
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

668
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,091
Kid, what's eating you?

669
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,261
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

670
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,140
The food chain!

671
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:24,143
Ahem.

672
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,728
So, where you from?

673
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,814
Who cares? I can't go back.

674
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:32,317
Ah, you're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

675
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,778
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

676
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,865
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

677
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,159
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

678
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,870
Not unless you can change the past.

679
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,248
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

680
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,834
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

681
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,502
No, no, no.

682
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,920
- I mean...
- Amateur.

683
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,173
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

684
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,384
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

685
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,472
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

686
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,598
- Right.
- Wrong!

687
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,309
When the world turns its back on you,

688
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,103
you turn your back on the world.

689
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,063
Well, that's not what I was taught.

690
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,357
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

691

But I don't understand something.

978

You've been alive all this time.

979
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,082
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

980
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:15,046
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

981
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,006
And I did, and it's great.

982
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,175
We've really needed you at home.

983
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:23,429
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

984
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,557
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

985
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,520
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

986
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,563
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

987
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,357
There's no food, no water.

988
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:37,068
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

989
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,444
- I can't go back.
- Why?

990
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,738
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

Simba...

995
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,459
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

996
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:58,089
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

997
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,050
I left to find help, and I found you.

Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

1000
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,478
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

1001
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:16,148
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

1002
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:19,068
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,112
Good. At least one of us does.

1004
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,491
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

1005
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,618
You don't even know
what I've been through.

1006
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,995
I would if you'd just tell me.

1007
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,955
- Forget it!
- Fine!

1008

She's wrong. I can't go back.

What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

You can't change the past.

- I didn't want to believe you.

1119
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,794
What made you come back?

1120
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,797
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1121
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,132
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1122
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,968
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1123
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,097
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1124
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,141
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1125
01:11:11,266 --> 01:11:15,687
Danger? Ha!
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!

1126
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,523
I see nothing funny about this.

1127
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,651
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1128
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,861
At your service, my liege.

1129
01:11:22,986 --> 01:11:26,657
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?

1130
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,369
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1131
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,830
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1132
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:37,376
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1133
01:11:56,186 --> 01:12:00,023
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1134
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,568
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1135
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,029
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1136
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,907
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1137
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,660
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1138
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,829

Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1154
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:07,132
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1156

It's over. There is nothing left.

1157
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:17,935
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1158
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:21,480
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1159
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,774
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1160
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:26,109
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1161

No. It's me.

Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1169

It doesn't matter. I'm home.

Simba?

1171
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:04,815
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

1172
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:06,316
alive.

1173
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:11,488
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1174
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,532
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1175
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,993
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1176
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,329
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1177
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,832
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1178
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,876
However, there is one little problem.

1179
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,795
You see them?

1180
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:30,799
They think I'm king.

1181
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:34,636
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1182
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:36,638
The choice is yours, Scar.

1183
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,182
Either step down or fight.

1184
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,685
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1185
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:46,023
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1186
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:49,359
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1187
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,986
I've put it behind me.

1188
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,863
But what about your faithful subjects?

1189
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,906
Have they put it behind them?

1190
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,075
Simba, what is he talking about?

1191
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,413
Ah, so you haven't told them
your little secret.

1192
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,875
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1193
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,171
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1194
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:13,383
I am.

1195
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,265
It's not true.

1196
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,060
Tell me it's not true.

1197
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,731
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1198
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,859
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1199
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:34,613
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1200
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:36,281
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1201
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:40,535
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1202
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,913
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1203
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,041
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1204
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:49,419
and now everyone knows why!

1205

Simba!

1206
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,971
Now, this looks familiar.

1207
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,765
Hmm.

1208
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,769
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.

1209
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,480
Oh, yes. I remember.

1210
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,776
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1211
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:18,323
And here's my little secret.

1212
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,952
(WHISPERING) I killed Mufasa.

1213
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:26,623
No! Murderer!

1214
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,918
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1215
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,672
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

I did it.

1219
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,013
So they can hear you.

1220
