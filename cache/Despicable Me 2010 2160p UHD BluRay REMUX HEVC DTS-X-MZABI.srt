Justin!

3
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:52,242
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

4
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:03,545
Justin, you get back here right now!

5
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:04,963
No, stop!

6
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,466
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

7
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:13,263
Wait, wait.

8
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,432
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

9
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,019
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!

10
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:23,273
No, no, no! Oh! There he goes.

11
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:35,994
Justin!

12
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,463
I've got him! I've got him!

13
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,852
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

14
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,688
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

15
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,649
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.

16

<i>Law enforcement still has no leads,</i>

19
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,578
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

20
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:20,205
is responsible for this heinous crime?

21
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:22,332
And where will he strike next?

How you doing?

32
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,102
Hello, Fred.

33
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:10,274
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

34
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,608
and I don't appreciate it.

35
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:16,113
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

36
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,948
Unless they're dead.

37
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:21,702
I'm joking!

38
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,706
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

Hello, everybody!

00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,044
Yeah, all right!

79
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,463
Simmer down. Simmer down!

80
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,423
Thank you, okay.

81
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,426
Now, I realize that you guys probably heard

82
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,262
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

83
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,681
Apparently, it's a big deal.

84
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:15,185
People are calling it the crime
of the century and stuff like that.

85
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:19,439
But am I upset? No, I am not!

86
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,359
A little,

87
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:26,363
but we have had a pretty
good year ourselves,

88
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:29,282
and you guys are all right in my book.

89
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,701
No, no raises!

90
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:34,955
You're not going to get any raises.

91
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,457
What did we do?

92
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:43,547
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

93
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,257
Nice!

94
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,842
Huh?

95
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:48,969
That's how I roll.

96
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:53,056
Yeah, you all like watching
football on that, huh?

97
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,267
But that's not all.

98
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,645
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

99
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,732
the small one from Las Vegas.

100
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,905
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.

101
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,783
Okay, I wasn't going to tell
you about this yet,

102
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:16,538
but I have been working
on something very big!

103
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:21,835
Something that will blow this
pyramid thing out of the water!

104
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:26,798
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr. Nefario...

105
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:28,216
Thank you!

106
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,010
Oh, there he is.

107
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,553
He's styling.

108
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,515
Now, we have located a shrink ray

109
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:40,228
in a secret lab, and once
we take this shrink ray,

110
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,732
we will have the capability

111
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:47,777
to pull off the true crime of the century.

112
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,989
We are going to steal...

113
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:57,913
Wait, wait!
I haven't told you what it is yet.

114
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,334
Hey.

115
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,544
Dave, listen up, please.

116
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:12,594
Next, we are going to steal,

117
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:15,013
pause for effect,

118
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,724
the moon!

119
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:23,021
And once the moon is mine,

120
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,817
the world will give me whatever
I want to get it back!

121
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:33,240
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!

122
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:39,746
That's what I'm talking about.

123
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,166
Yes?

124
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,003
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

125
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:50,257
and I really don't see
how we can afford this.

126
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,134
It can't be done.
I'm not a miracle worker.

127
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,220
Hey, chillax.

128
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:58,932
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!

129
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,324
Edith, stop it!

130
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,493
What? I'm just walking.

131
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,425
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

132
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:37,804
Hello, girls!

133
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,724
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

134
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,643
Mmm. Let me think.

135
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,228
No!

136
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,526
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

137
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,611
A mud pie.

138
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:58,283
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

139
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,660
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

140
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:04,331
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

141
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,499
Sort of.

142
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,837
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

143
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:14,924
Okay.

144
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,179
Well, you say that like
it's a great sale day.

145
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,431
Look at my face!

146
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:24,768
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

147
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,687
Eighteen coco-nutties.

148
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:32,776
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

149
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,652
Yeah.

150
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:39,115
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

151
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:40,700
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

152
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:44,496
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

153
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,791
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

154
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,042
Hi, guys.

155
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:57,217
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

156
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,845
I just wanted to congratulate
you on stealing the pyramid.

157
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:03,306
<i>That was you, wasn't it?</i>

158
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,185
Or was it a villain who's
actually successful?

159
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:11,064
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

160
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,900
that's very, very big, very important.

161
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,070
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

162
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:21,825
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

163
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,228
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.

164
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,731
Yes, please have a seat.

165
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,120
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

166
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,374
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

167
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,211
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

168
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:59,214
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

169
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,966
NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.

170
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,768
Hey.

171
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:23,404
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

172
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:29,494
It's a mathematical term,

173
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:34,123
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

174
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:40,088
Vector! That's me,

175
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:45,426
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

176
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,178
Oh, yeah!

177
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:50,932
Check out my new weapon.

178
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,268
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

179
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:57,105
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

180
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,357
Do you want a demonstration?

181
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:04,571
Oh! Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

182
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,156
Mr. Gru, Mr. Perkins will see you now.

183
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,325
So, all I need

184
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,453
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

185
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:15,498
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

186
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:18,251
Well, very nice presentation.

187
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,628
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

188
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,464
Absolutely! Will do.

189
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,841
Soon as I have it.

190
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,844
You don't have it?

191
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:31,639
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

192
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,183
Apparently.

193
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,646
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?

194
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:44,319
With far too few of your sinister
plots actually turning a profit.

195
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:48,990
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.

196
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:52,035
If we don't start getting our money back...

197
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,538
Get the picture?

198
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:00,543
Look, Gru, the point is, there are
a lot of new villains out there,

199
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:03,671
younger than you, hungrier than you,

200
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:05,798
younger than you.

201
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,176
Like that young fellow
out there named Vector.

202
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,886
He just stole a pyramid!

203
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,517
I've got it. I've got it.

204
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:20,480
Um... So, as far as getting
money for the rocket...

205
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:23,566
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

206
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,282
Suckers!

207
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,997
Suckers!

208
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,213
Ah-ha! We got it!

209
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:17,388
What?

210
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,308
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

211
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,019
No, no, no!

212
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:27,732
You!

213
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:34,489
<i>Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!</i>

214
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,365
<i>So long, Gru!</i>

215
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,702
Quick! We can't let him get away!

216
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,879
Up ahead! Up ahead!

217
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:52,340
Fire! Fire, now!

218
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,391
Oops, you missed me!

219
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,560
Come to papa!

220
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,075
Take that.

221
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:23,412
How adorable.

222
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,581
Got you in our sights!

223
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:28,417
Like taking candy from a...

224
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:29,752
What?

225
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:32,755
Ha! Hey, Gru!

226
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,967
Try this on for size!

227
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:40,137
That's weird. What is going...

228
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,103
This is claustrophobic!

229
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:49,939
No, no, no!

230
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:58,197
Too small! This is too small for me!

231
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,289
I hate that guy!

232
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,133
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

233
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:21,304
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

234
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,639
and lay eggs in our brains.

235
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,642
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.

236
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:29,979
And please bless that someone
will adopt us soon,

237
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:32,982
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice

238
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,984
and have a pet unicorn.

239
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:36,652
Amen.

240
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,487
- Amen.
- Amen.

241
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:46,662
<i>Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them</i>

242
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:50,458
<i>Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them</i>

243
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,170
<i>Uni, unicorns, I could pet one</i>

244
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,589
<i>If they were really real</i>

245
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:57,840
<i>And they are</i>

246
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:00,468
<i>So, I bought one so I could pet it</i>

247
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,763
<i>Now it loves me
Now I love it</i>

248
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,848
<i>La, la, la, la, la</i>

249
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:22,925
Don't you... What the...

250
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:54,623
Oh, good luck, little girls!

251
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,964
Whoa! Cool.

252
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,136
Hi! We're orphans from
Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

253
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,138
- <i>I don't care. Beat it!</i>
- Come on!

254
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:12,475
<i>We're selling cookies so, you know,
we can have a better future.</i>

255
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,226
<i>Ooh! Wait, wait!
Do you have coco-nutties?</i>

256
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,436
Yeah.

257
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,668
Light bulb.

258
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:44,090
- Dr. Nefario!
- <i>Huh?</i>

259
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:47,426
I'm going to need a dozen tiny
robots disguised as cookies!

260
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,512
- <i>What?</i>
- Cookie robots!

261
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:52,014
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Oh, forget it.

262
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:01,440
Well, it appears you have
cleared our background check,

263
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:03,692
Dr. Gru.

264
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,115
Oh! And I see you have made a list

265
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:12,993
of some of your personal achievements.

266
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,871
Thank you for that. I love reading.

267
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:26,132
And I see you have been
given the Medal of Honor

268
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,342
and a knighthood.

269
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,138
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

270
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,305
Kevin?

271
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,393
You had your own cooking show

272
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,397
and you can hold your
breath for 30 seconds?

273
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,065
It's not that impressive.

274
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,233
Uh...

275
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:46,735
Idiot!

276
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:51,490
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

277
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,744
What in the name of... What?

278
00:26:56,996 --> 00:27:00,166
Well, here's the dealio.

279
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:05,212
Things have been so lonely since my wife,

280
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:09,592
Debbie, passed on.

281
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,761
It's like my heart is a tooth,

282
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,267
and it's got a cavity that can
only be filled with children.

283
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:19,894
I'm sorry.

284
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,443
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

285
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:30,362
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

286
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:35,784
You have a face <i>como un burro</i>.

287
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:39,205
Oh!

288
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,790
Well, thank you!

289
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:46,962
Anyway, can we proceed
with this adoption?

290
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,631
So, so excited!

291
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:53,969
Please tell Margo, Edith and
Agnes to come to the lobby.

292
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:58,724
I bet the mom is beautiful!

293
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,893
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

294
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:03,812
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.

295
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,107
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

296
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:11,487
Aw! My caterpillar never
turned into a butterfly.

297
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,072
That's a Cheeto.

298
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,323
Oh!

299
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:19,828
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

300
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:23,666
Who's Debbie?

301
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,501
Your wife.

302
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,127
Oh! Hi, girls!

303
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,974
Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Gru.

304
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,352
He's going to adopt you.

305
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,021
And he's a dentist!

306
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:49,692
Yeah!

307
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:53,362
Um...

308
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:57,825
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

309
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,202
And that's Agnes.

310
00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:02,204
I got your leg, I got your leg!

311
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:05,374
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

312
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:07,793
- Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
- Higher!

313
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,212
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

314
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:13,632
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

315
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,718
Some nonstick spray?

316
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,555
Crowbar?

317
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:23,350
Okay, girls, let's go.

318
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:46,415
Ah-ha!

319
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:48,584
Oh, yeah!

320
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,005
Pretty impressive!

321
00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:56,258
What are you looking at?

322
00:29:56,342 --> 00:29:57,593
Boo-ya!

323
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,764
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

324
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:03,432
Take that!

325
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,934
You done been shrunk!

326
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:08,437
Yello?

327
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,273
I got the shrink ray, all right.

328
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,943
No, I'm not playing with it.

329
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,446
Gru?

330
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:20,199
Don't make me laugh! No.

331
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:23,202
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

332
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:26,372
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,

333
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:27,956
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

334
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,293
Okay, bye.

335
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:37,383
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

336
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,636
Curse you, tiny toilet!

337
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,393
Okay, here we are.

338
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:48,977
Home sweet home.

339
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,400
So, this is, like, your house?

340
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,485
Wait a sec...

341
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,321
You're the guy who pretended
he was a recorded message!

342
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:01,407
No, that was someone else.

343
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:16,255
Can I hold your hand?

344
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,090
Uh, no.

345
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,188
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like <i>Annie</i>.

346
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:43,449
No, hey!

347
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:50,706
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.

348
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,375
Girls, this is Kyle, my

349
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,543
dog.

350
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:58,505
Ooh! Fluffy doggy!

351
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,053
What kind of dog is that?

352
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:07,723
He is a... I don't know.

353
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,852
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

354
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:14,021
'Cause it's not.

355
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,399
No! No! Stay away from there!

356
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,067
It's fragile.

357
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:25,073
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.

358
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,993
Hey! It's dark in here.

359
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:33,207
It poked a hole in my juice box.

360
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,421
As you can see,

361
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:43,008
I have provided everything
a child might need.

362
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:45,928
All right.

363
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,431
Uh... Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

364
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:51,725
Somebody broke that.

365
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:55,854
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

366
00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:57,773
Rule number one.

367
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,442
You will not touch anything.

368
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,361
Uh-huh. What about the floor?

369
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,780
Yes, you may touch the floor.

370
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:06,281
What about the air?

371
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:08,450
Yes, you may touch the air!

372
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,576
What about this?

373
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,706
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

374
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,544
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.

375
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:20,546
Rule number three.

376
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:25,092
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle

377
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:27,803
or sneeze or burp or fart!

378
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,808
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?

379
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,726
Does this count as annoying?

380
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,815
Very!

381
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,736
I will see you in six hours.

382
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:50,742
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

383
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:55,747
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

384
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,333
Mmm?

385
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:27,321
Uh, question. What are these?

386
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:32,701
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

387
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:34,786
Look at this. Watch me!

388
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:41,376
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.

389
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,546
Why are you so old?

390
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,717
Okay. I'm on it.

391
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:50,886
Hello?

392
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:07,819
TV!

393
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:28,882
What is that?

394
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,510
- Look at that!
- Wow! That is cool!

395
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,595
Come on!

396
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:36,431
I don't think he's a dentist.

397
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,114
We've been working on this for a while.

398
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,950
It's a anti-gravity serum.

399
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:04,042
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

400
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:07,212
- Do the effects wear off?
- Uh, so far,

401
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,297
no. No, they don't.

402
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:13,927
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

403
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:18,640
No, no.

404
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:22,561
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

405
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:25,897
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

406
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,567
under what circumstances
would we use this?

407
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,152
But, anyway.

408
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,655
What I really wanted to show you was this.

409
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,496
Now those are cookie robots!

410
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:45,917
<i>La, la, la, la
I love unicorns</i>

411
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:49,671
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

412
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,424
We got bored. What is this place?

413
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:54,259
Can I drink this?

414
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,803
Do you want to explode?

415
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,431
Gru!

416
00:36:59,514 --> 00:37:01,516
Get back in the kitchen!

417
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,685
- Will you play with us?
- No.

418
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:06,354
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

419
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:08,023
Doing what?

420
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:09,357
Um...

421
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,026
Okay, okay, you got me.

422
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,862
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

423
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:16,929
In real life, I am a spy.

424
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:20,599
And it is top secret, and you
may not tell anybody,

425
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:22,768
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

426
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,023
- Hey!
- Oops.

427
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,067
My unicorn!

428
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,027
You have to fix it.

429
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:37,449
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

430
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:44,873
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?

431
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:48,127
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

432
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,797
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

433
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:57,302
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

434
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,721
Tim! Mark! Phil!

435
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,642
This is very important.

436
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:07,146
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

437
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:08,313
Eh?

438
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:15,154
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

439
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,407
Go, and hurry!

440
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,658
What are those?

441
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,953
They are my cousins.

442
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:25,330
Jerry! Stuart!

443
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:29,418
Watch them, and keep them
away from me, please.

444
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:49,021
- Wow!
- Wow!

445
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,377
Ooh!

446
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:26,391
Oh!

447
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:27,643
Hmm...

448
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,254
It was your cousin's idea.

449
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:56,755
What?

450
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,674
Okay, bedtime.

451
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:00,092
Aw!

452
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:01,677
- Aw!
- Aw!

453
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,428
Not you two!

454
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,685
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

455
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:13,438
Just so you know,

456
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,274
you're never gonna be my dad.

457
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:18,110
Hmm. I think I can live with that.

458
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:21,613
Are these beds made out of bombs?

459
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:26,368
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

460
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,288
But try not to toss and turn.

461
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:30,539
Cool.

462
00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:34,626
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.

463
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,796
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

464
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:41,466
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

465
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:45,971
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

466
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:49,933
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

467
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:54,146
And there's probably
something in your closet.

468
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,899
He's just kidding, Agnes.

469
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:22,062
It's beautiful.

470
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,926
Girls, let's go.

471
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,846
Time to deliver the cookies!

472
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,516
Mmm. Okay. But first,
we're going to dance class.

473
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,519
Actually, we're going to have
to skip the dance class today.

474
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,354
Actually, we can't

475
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,107
skip the dance class today.

476
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:09,192
We have a big recital coming up.

477
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,529
- We're doing an excerpt from <i>Swan Lake</i>.
- Yeah, <i>Swan Lake</i>!

478
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,364
That's fantastic. Wonderful.

479
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:18,577
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!

480
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,788
No.

481
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,707
No?

482
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,960
We're not going to deliver
cookies until we do dance class.

483
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,211
Really?

484
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,965
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.

485
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,471
So if you want to go, you are going
to have to walk yourselves.

486
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,811
What are you doing?

487
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:46,647
Walking to dance class.

488
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,732
Ya? Okay, fine.

489
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:52,653
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

490
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,987
Okay.

491
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,949
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

492
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:00,410
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

493
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,496
And you had better be in this car!

494
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,166
Here we go! One! Two!

495
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,836
...three, four and five.

496
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:12,839
And lift, and stretch.

497
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:15,509
And one, and two...

498
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,761
- Here you go.
- What is it?

499
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:21,348
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

500
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,100
Of course, of course.

501
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,269
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.

502
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,021
Pinkie promise?

503
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,693
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

504
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:50,544
All right. Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

505
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,379
But he's a V.

506
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,464
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

507
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,466
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

508
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,471
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

509
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,768
I was just thinking

510
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,605
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr. Vector's first.

511
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,315
That is all.

512
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,113
Almost over. It's almost over.

513
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:24,453
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

514
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,956
Do you have my cookies for me?

515
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,632
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes,

516
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:42,429
two caramel clumpies and
fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

517
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:46,099
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody
else order that many cookies.

518
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,267
Not likely.

519
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,519
Name one person who ordered
more cookies than me.

520
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,146
That'll be $52.

521
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,023
Right.

522
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,325
Seven, eight, nine...

523
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,787
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

524
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,081
Seven, eight, nine...

525
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,958
Why are you wearing pajamas?

526
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,338
These aren't pajamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

527
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,357
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

528
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,483
What sort of stuff?

529
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,985
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

530
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,487
Like sleeping?

531
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,448
They are not pajamas!

532
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:58,505
Here you go, 52 big ones.

533
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:18,066
Bye!

534
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,371
Come on!

535
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,270
What the...

536
00:47:40,106 --> 00:47:41,775
Quiet down, fish!

537
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:49,908
Down, boy!

538
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,889
Ah-ha!

539
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,309
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!

540
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,320
But what about the other
people who ordered cookies?

541
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,115
Life is full of disappointments

542
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,909
for some people.

543
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,207
Don't do that!

544
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,293
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?

545
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,795
No.

546
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:46,381
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

547
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:47,507
Don't care.

548
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,717
- Please?
- Please?

549
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,427
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

550
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,554
- Pretty please?
- Please?

551
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,646
- Come on!
- Come on!

552
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,524
Light bulb.

553
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,072
Come on!

554
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,117
Goodbye, have fun.

555
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,082
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

556
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,584
What?

557
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,475
Oh, my gosh!

558
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:22,977
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

559
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,024
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

560
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,567
You've gotta let us play for it!

561
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,361
No, no, no.

562
00:50:31,444 --> 00:50:32,737
Come on!

563
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,825
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

564
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,953
Well, it is not for sale.

565
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:44,999
But all you gotta do to win it is knock
down that little spaceship there.

566
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,001
It's easy!

567
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,678
Yay!

568
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,858
Again!

569
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,027
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

570
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,279
Just one more.

571
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,698
I accidentally closed my eyes.

572
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:34,048
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

573
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,926
Aw!

574
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:41,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

575
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,226
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.

576
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,062
Hey, buddy, let me explain
something to you.

577
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:52,692
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

578
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:55,612
Do you know what that means, professor?

579
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,240
It means you don't get the unicorn!

580
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,284
Oh! Uh-oh!

581
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:03,244
Somebody's got a frowny face.

582
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,747
Boo! Better luck next time!

583
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:10,668
Okay, my turn.

584
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:34,609
Knocked over!

585
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,866
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

586
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,619
That was awesome!

587
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:46,329
You blew up the whole thing!

588
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:48,790
Let's go. Let's try another game!

589
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,258
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?

590
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:01,261
Okay, girls, go play.

591
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,104
I got the shrink ray!

592
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:15,942
Cotton candy!

593
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,905
We have 12 days until the moon
is in optimum position.

594
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,116
We can't afford any distractions!

595
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,119
Get me Perkins.

596
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,501
Ah-ha!

597
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:36,296
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Perkins,

598
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,341
but I figured that you
would want to see this!

599
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,260
What?

600
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:57,275
<i>Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.</i>

601
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,361
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.

602
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,741
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.

603
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,536
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.

604
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:10,246
What?

605
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,457
<i>Sorry. Sorry!</i>

606
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,668
<i>Could you excuse me for just one second?</i>

607
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,170
I told you not to touch my things.

608
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,256
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

609
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,050
Hey, can we order pizza?

610
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,052
Pizza? You just had lunch.

611
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,303
Not now, for dinner.

612
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,929
Dinner?

613
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,849
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

614
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,726
Oh! Can we get stuffed crust?

615
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:34,228
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

616
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,897
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

617
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,275
You're funny!

618
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,111
Just don't come out of that room again!

619
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:43,696
All right.

620
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,034
<i>Sorry about that.
Where were we?</i>

621
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:49,702
You were sitting on the toilet.

622
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:54,332
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humor.

623
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:57,210
I know how much you like to laugh

624
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,508
inside. Now, I was saying...

625
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,055
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

626
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,516
<i>Believe me, I am completely focused.</i>

627
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,601
- <i>Hello! Whoa!</i>
- What?

628
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:14,852
That guy is huge!

629
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,354
- Are we on TV?
- <i>What are those? Children?</i>

630
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:19,232
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

631
00:55:24,445 --> 00:55:25,696
No, no, no!

632
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,823
Freeze ray!

633
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,533
<i>Mr. Gru?</i>

634
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,580
Okay.

635
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,333
As I was saying...

636
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,254
<i>No need to continue.
I've seen quite enough.</i>

637
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,714
- But my plan...
- <i>Is a great plan.</i>

638
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,968
<i>I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.</i>

639
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,178
<i>You.</i>

640
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,018
Look, Mom, I drew a picture
of me landing on the moon!

641
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:03,151
Look, Mom, I made a prototype
of the rocket out of macaroni!

642
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:10,158
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

643
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,171
I don't understand.

644
00:56:23,504 --> 00:56:25,798
<i>Let's face reality, Gru.</i>

645
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:30,636
<i>You've been at this for far too
long with far too little success.</i>

646
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:35,057
<i>We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...</i>

647
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,518
<i>Well, a younger villain.</i>

648
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,103
But I...

649
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,272
<i>It's over. Goodbye, Gru.</i>

650
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:07,006
Now, I know there have been
some rumors going around

651
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,384
that the bank is no longer funding us.

652
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,055
Well, I am here to put those rumors to rest.

653
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,142
They are true.

654
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,977
Uh-oh!

655
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,271
In terms of money,

656
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,608
we have no money.

657
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:28,277
So how will we get to the moon?

658
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,280
The answer is clear.

659
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,949
We won't.

660
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:38,287
We are doomed.

661
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,168
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

662
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,171
I know.

663
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:52,468
I have fired up my resume as I
suggest that all of you do, as well.

664
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:55,054
What is it?

665
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,268
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

666
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:31,299
Yes!

667
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,302
Yes, we will build our own rocket

668
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:38,472
using this and whatever else we can find!

669
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:42,560
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!

670
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,937
Who needs the bank?

671
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,772
Let's go. Let's go!

672
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,033
Mom! What are you doing here?

673
00:59:39,116 --> 00:59:41,952
And here he is in the bathtub.

674
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:44,330
Oh! Look at his little buns.

675
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,167
Mom.

676
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,627
Not cool.

677
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:55,174
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

678
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:57,510
He looks like a girl!

679
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:01,305
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

680
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,705
You're funny!

681
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:42,179
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

682
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,825
<i>Mr. Perkins, your son is here.</i>

683
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:04,744
Send him in.

684
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:07,580
Hey, Dad.

685
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,874
You wanted to see me?

686
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,918
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor anymore.

687
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,464
Victor was my nerd name.
Now I am Vector!

688
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,923
Sit down!

689
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,927
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

690
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,305
Duh! Back at my place.

691
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,266
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? Oh, that's cool.

692
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:31,604
I guess Gru must just have
one that looks exactly like it!

693
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,443
Oh! What the...
Those girls sold me cookies!

694
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,489
Do you have any idea how lucrative
this moon heist could be?

695
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,365
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

696
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,284
and you just blow it!

697
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,455
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

698
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,750
You just wait until Gru
sees my latest weapon.

699
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,836
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

700
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,966
There's a squid on my face!

701
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,803
Don't worry.

702
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,139
The moon is as good as ours.

703
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:11,477
Come on now, it's bedtime.

704
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,188
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

705
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:16,732
You did not!

706
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,903
Put on your PGs. Hold still.
Okay, seriously! Seriously!

707
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:25,491
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

708
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:28,327
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

709
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,663
Will you read us a bedtime story?

710
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,876
No.

711
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:37,211
Pretty please!

712
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:41,131
The physical appearance
of the "please" makes no difference.

713
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,300
It is still no, so go to sleep.

714
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,511
But we can't. We're all hyper!

715
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:50,099
And without a bedtime story, we'll just
keep getting up and bugging you.

716
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:51,267
All night long.

717
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,687
Fine.

718
01:02:55,729 --> 01:02:58,732
All right, all right. <i>Sleepy Kittens.</i>

719
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:00,526
<i>Sleepy Kittens?</i>

720
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,361
- What are these?
- Puppets.

721
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,114
You use them when you tell the story.

722
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,748
Okay, let's get this over with.

723
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:19,503
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

724
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:24,008
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed.'"

725
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:27,970
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

726
01:03:28,053 --> 01:03:29,346
Keep reading!

727
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,683
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

728
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:35,352
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

729
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,771
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'

730
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,399
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,

731
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:44,153
"'Fine, but at least you
should brush your fur.'"

732
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,405
Now you brush the fur.

733
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,867
This is literature?

734
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,245
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

735
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,749
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed

736
01:03:56,832 --> 01:04:00,252
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed!'

737
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,422
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,

738
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:06,425
"'Fine, but at least you
should drink your milk.'"

739
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:08,844
Now make them drink the milk.

740
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,061
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

741
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:23,484
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone,
rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.

742
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:35,663
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

743
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:41,502
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

744
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:45,297
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,

745
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:50,135
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart.'"

746
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:56,475
The end. Okay, good night.

747
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,728
- Wait!
- What?

748
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,689
What about good night kisses?

749
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,403
No, no. There will be no
kissing or hugging or kissing.

750
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:12,908
He is not gonna kiss us
good night, Agnes.

751
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,577
I like him. He's nice.

752
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,996
But scary.

753
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,540
Like Santa!

754
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:42,271
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

755
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,191
Uh... About that,

756
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:50,946
I was thinking that maybe we could
move the date of the heist.

757
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:56,618
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

758
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,912
No, no, no!

759
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,041
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

760
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:07,046
I just think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

761
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:12,718
I was thinking, maybe a heist
is a Tuesday thing, right?

762
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:17,056
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

763
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,224
It's everything we've dreamed of.

764
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,226
Your chance to make history,

765
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,521
become the man who stole the moon!

766
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,317
But these girls are becoming
a major distraction!

767
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,735
They need to go.

768
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,573
If you don't do something
about it, then I will.

769
01:06:36,241 --> 01:06:37,910
I understand.

770
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:41,914
Good.

771
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,251
Butt.

772
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,631
Butt.

773
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,394
Butt.

774
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:09,983
All right. Now, when we
put our cups together,

775
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,736
we will make the "clink"
sound with our mouths.

776
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,987
Ready? Edith?

777
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,114
- Clink.
- Clink.

778
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,241
There we go. And now we drink.

779
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,992
And Agnes?

780
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,160
- Clink.
- Clink.

781
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:21,620
Very good!

782
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,331
Excuse me, girls.

783
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:26,208
Come on!

784
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,837
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Keep clinking.

785
01:07:30,295 --> 01:07:31,463
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

786
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:33,715
Oh!

787
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,676
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

788
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:39,680
I'm here for the girls. I received a call
that you wanted to return them.

789
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:46,520
And also, I did purchase
a Spanish dictionary.

790
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,150
I didn't like what you said.

791
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,651
But...

792
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:57,781
Oh!

793
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,493
I will get the girls ready.

794
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,839
Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru!

795
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,967
Tell her you wanna keep us.

796
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,052
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

797
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,680
Goodbye, Mr. Gru.
Thanks for everything.

798
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,865
I did it for your own good.

799
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,327
Come on, let's go get that moon.

800
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,205
Right.

801
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,949
What is this for?

802
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:06,868
The recital?

803
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,205
I am the greatest criminal
mind of the century.

804
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,418
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!

805
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:40,152
<i>Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.</i>

806
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:45,282
<i>And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.</i>

807
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:50,787
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

808
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:51,955
six...

809
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,232
Oh, yeah!

810
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,737
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

811
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,238
Boo-ya!

812
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,085
My flight suit.

813
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:43,048
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

814
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,154
Whoa!

815
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,757
Ah-ha!

816
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,593
I've got it!

817
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:13,889
I've got the moon!

818
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,808
I've got the moon!

819
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,366
I can make it!

820
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:43,001
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

821
01:13:46,129 --> 01:13:47,672
Come on, come on!

822
01:13:55,972 --> 01:13:57,516
He's still not here.

823
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,018
Why would he come? He gave us up.

824
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:01,645
But he pinkie promised!

825
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,481
Girls, girls, places!

826
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:07,359
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

827
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,861
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

828
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:16,076
All right. But just a few more minutes.

829
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:18,245
He's not coming, guys.

830
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:23,708
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

831
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:29,589
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

832
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,585
Okay, okay. There's the library.

833
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,379
That's Third Street. The dance studio...

834
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:10,922
There! There! There it is!

835
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:50,795
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

836
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:52,756
Over?

837
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,170
Vector, open up!

838
01:16:33,963 --> 01:16:36,466
<i>First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.</i>

839
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:52,524
<i>- Mr. Gru!
- Zip it, Happy Meal.</i>

840
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,109
Now, the girls.

841
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:58,530
<i>Actually, I think I'll hold on
to them a little while longer.</i>

842
01:16:58,655 --> 01:16:59,698
No!

843
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,450
<i>Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!</i>

844
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,619
Listen close, you little punk.

845
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:08,039
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

846
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:11,209
I'm really scared!

847
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:16,506
He is gonna kick your butt.

848
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,673
What? He punched my shark!

849
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:26,534
Ha! There he is!

850
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,708
Hang on, Gru.

851
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,340
Oh, no!

852
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:44,719
Ow?

853
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:52,477
Vector has the girls. Go!

854
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,149
What happened to the ship? It's big again!

855
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,985
- Not as big as the moon is going to be!
- What?

856
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:06,157
The larger the mass of an object, the quicker
the effects of the shrink ray wear off!

857
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,160
I call it the Nefario Principle.

858
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,162
I just came up with it now, actually.

859
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:13,456
Oh, no!

860
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,839
Did you see that?

861
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,675
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

862
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:24,968
- Over here!
- Hey!

863
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,678
What are you girls doing back there?

864
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:27,804
The moon!

865
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:42,819
Ouch!

866
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:44,988
Watch out!

867
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,618
Get as close in as you can.

868
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:52,745
You got it.

869
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:11,306
- Mr. Gru, up here!
- Mr. Gru!

870
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,433
Okay, girls! Girls!

871
01:20:13,516 --> 01:20:16,227
- You're going to have to jump.
- Jump?

872
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,229
Are you insane?

873
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,731
Don't worry, I will catch you.

874
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:22,066
You gave us back!

875
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:26,321
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

876
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,823
But you have to jump now.

877
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,492
It'll be okay.

878
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:37,498
Okay, girls.

879
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,085
Jump now!

880
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,384
Margo, I will catch you.

881
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:52,096
And I will never let you go again.

882
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:03,733
- Not so fast!
- No!

883
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:05,401
Let me go!

884
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,114
Margo!

885
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:11,658
Whoa!

886
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,122
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!

887
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,569
I got you.

888
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:07,839
No!

889
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:26,107
Oh, poop.

890
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,193
This time, good triumphs,

891
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,572
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

892
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:37,410
But once again, law enforcement
is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder,

893
01:22:37,493 --> 01:22:39,287
who is this mysterious hero?

894
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,372
And what will he do next?

895
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,666
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

896
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,462
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

897
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:51,799
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

898
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:56,429
Tonight we are going to read a new book.

899
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,723
This one is called

900
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:02,477
<i>One Big Unicorn</i> by... Who wrote this?

901
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,981
Oh! Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!

902
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,484
Here, watch this.

903
01:23:10,651 --> 01:23:12,070
That's the horn!

904
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,576
This is gonna be the best book ever!

905
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:23,456
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

906
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:24,624
Here we go.

907
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:27,710
"One big unicorn, strong and free

908
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:30,505
"thought he was happy as he could be.

909
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:35,301
"Then three little kittens came around

910
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:39,388
"and turned his whole life upside down."

911
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:41,224
Hey, that one looks like me!

912
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:43,434
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

913
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:47,271
Any relation to persons living
or dead is completely coincidental.

914
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:53,194
"They made him laugh.

915
01:23:53,277 --> 01:23:56,364
"They made him cry.

916
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,201
"He never should have said goodbye.

917
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:05,623
"And now he knows he could never part

918
01:24:05,706 --> 01:24:08,292
"from those three little kittens

919
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,712
"that changed his heart.

920
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,881
"The end."

921
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:16,300
Okay, all right. Good night.

922
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,242
I love you.

923
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,494
I love you, too.

924
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,672
No, no!

925
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,009
All right.

926
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,515
Didn't I get you already?

927
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,010
They're very good!

928
01:25:41,093 --> 01:25:44,055
I'm so proud of you, Son.

929
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,058
You've turned out to be a great parent!

930
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,727
Just like me.

931
01:25:50,269 --> 01:25:52,563
Maybe even better.

932
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:21,592
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

933
01:26:23,302 --> 01:26:24,762
No, no, no!

934
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,030
Hey, Carl! Hey.

935
01:28:06,113 --> 01:28:07,114
Hmm?

936
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:11,369
No, no, no.

937
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,661
Me, me, me.

938
01:28:13,996 --> 01:28:15,039
John?

939
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,123
No, no. Me, me, me.

940
01:28:40,314 --> 01:28:42,066
Oh, poop.

941
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,280
Oh, no!

942
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,574
Stop! Stop!

943
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:04,231
Huh?

944
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:34,178
Hello, I am Gru.

945
01:30:34,261 --> 01:30:37,264
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
