1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,550
You...

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,844
let us in.

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,266
And now...

4
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,610
you are going to have to let us stay.

5
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,115
It doesn't make sense.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,244
I closed the gate.

7
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,166
What if he never left?

8
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,506
What if we locked him out here with us?

9
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,845
He'd want to attach himself
to someone again.

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,183
A new host.

11
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,523
It's building something.

12
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,112
No matter what happens...

13
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,240
we have to stop him.

14
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,785
Together.

15
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,706
And now, it's time.

16
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,044
We're going to end you.

17
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,547
We're going to end your friends.

18
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,091
Then...

19
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,136
we are going to end everyone.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,269
Our kids are in danger.

21
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,854
We need to end this.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,399
I can fight.

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,735
Better than any of us.

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,486
But I need you safe.

25
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,780
What the hell?

26
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,497
I need you to trust me.

27
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,007
Holy mother of God.

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,363
Do you copy?

29
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,492
I repeat, this is a code red!

30
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:46,199
