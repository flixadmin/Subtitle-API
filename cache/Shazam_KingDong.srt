1
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,898
Thad...

2
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,922
I said no toys at Grandfather's.

3
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:07,828
But it's Christmas.

4
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,077
- Stop it!
- Hey.

5
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,220
Hey, Dad!

6
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:13,625
Hey!

7
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,900
Thad, you can't go crying
to other people all the time.

8
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:20,758
A man needs to know
when to stand up for himself.

9
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:25,695
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,
will Thad ever be a man?

10
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:33,099
Ouch. "Outlook not so good."

11
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,813
You broke it.

12
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,820
Dad?

13
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:50,747
Sid?

14
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,672
Someone help me!

15
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,406
Help!

16
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,029
Hello?

17
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:51,427
Thaddeus.

18
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,794
Thaddeus Sivana.

19
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:29,441
Who are you? How do you know my name?

20
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,635
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

21
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:38,442
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

22
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:46,315
But years have passed, and I grow weak.

23
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:51,362
That is why I seek a champion
to inherit my magic.

24
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,209
You want me to do magic?

25
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,302
With this,

26
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,662
all of my powers will become yours.

27
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,216
But first...

28
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:13,248
...you must demonstrate that you're
pure of heart and strong in spirit.

29
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:18,693
He lies.

30
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:22,768
Don't be his champion.

31
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,532
We can give you power.

32
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,873
Take the eye.

33
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:34,560
Take it.

34
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:42,997
Your father thinks you're weak.
Show him your power.

35
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,326
Take the eye.

36
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:54,381
No!

37
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:59,238
What? What happened?

38
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,068
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

39
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:07,605
But you, you will never be worthy.

40
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,106
Wait.

41
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:18,174
- I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

42
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,450
Let me back in!

43
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,177
Calm down, Thad!

44
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,360
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

45
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,579
- Calm down.
- Stop!

46
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,341
Hey, I'm gonna kill you, you little freak!

47
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,388
Stop... Oh!

48
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,868
I was just there.

49
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,927
This man, this wizard,
he took me to a castle...

50
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:49,935
Stop.

51
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,851
- ...and...
- Stop!

52
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,279
Stop it!

53
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:55,961
You miserable, whiny, little shit!

54
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:57,822
You could have killed us!

55
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,474
Do you understand that?

56
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,121
Dad?

57
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:48,576
Dad!

58
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:02,177
Dad?

59
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:05,513
You're okay.

60
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,232
You're gonna be okay.

61
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:16,017
You did this.

62
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:17,568
You did this!

63
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,070
No.

64
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,219
Dad.

65
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:47,490
Your magic grows weak.

66
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:51,894
Soon, you won't be able to contain us.

67
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:58,234
Seeking Spell,
find me one soul who is worthy.

68
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,656
No matter how long it takes.

69
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,053
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

70
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:52,746
Sure glad to see you.

71
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,903
I called as soon as I saw.

72
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,184
They're in there.

73
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,500
You stay here.

74
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,711
Police!

75
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,484
I saw 'em hide back in there.

76
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,984
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

77
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,474
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

78
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,531
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

79
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,153
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

80
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:27,072
Stop, stop, stop!

81
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,718
Open this up right now, kid.

82
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,734
That's a federal offense, kid.
You can't do that!

83
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,586
Do not go in that car.

84
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:35,931
Come on, open the door. Please.

85
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:37,289
Please, come on.

86
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,789
Open this, right now!

87
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,482
Very good, very funny.

88
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,742
Very funny. That's great. That's hilarious.

89
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,742
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at
the Laurelwood shopping center, please.

90
00:09:56,368 --> 00:10:00,189
Dispatch, cancel that request.
Some kid stole our walkie-talkies.

91
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:03,031
Walkie-talkies? How old are you?

92
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:10,716
No, no, no.

93
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,914
That's my lunch, kid!

94
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:20,072
Miss Batson... I've been looking for you.

95
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,684
No. Gosh.

96
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,423
It's me. It's Billy.

97
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,711
Okay.

98
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:42,498
I want the tiger.

99
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:46,398
I know, honey, I know.
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

100
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,117
We got one!

101
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,285
But I wanted a tiger.

102
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,023
Oh, but this is the real prize, baby. See?

103
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,230
You can use that your whole life.

104
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:03,382
You'll always find your way.

105
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,482
I can't let the ball get away.

106
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,023
Mom?

107
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,164
Mom!

108
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,869
Mom!

109
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,703
Hey. Who are you with, bud?

110
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,102
Yeah, he says it's Billy Batson.

111
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:02,836
Hey, don't worry, kid.

112
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,204
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, okay?

113
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,102
They always do.

114
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,785
Mom, I'm home.

115
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:52,496
Yes?

116
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:57,396
Yeah, uh, is this Rachel Batson?

117
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,945
Who's asking?

118
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,755
Um... Yeah, see, the thing is...

119
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:04,847
I think you're my mom.

120
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,794
You sure about that?

121
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,403
Sorry to bother you.

122
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,343
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

123
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,207
You save me any fries?

124
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:29,172
Foster home in Pittsburgh
reported you missing two weeks ago.

125
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,615
You're sending me back?

126
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,777
No. They don't want you.

127
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,517
Harsh.

128
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:40,107
You laugh, but you've run from foster
homes in six counties, Mr. Batson.

129
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,263
From good people...

130
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:47,873
...who want you, all in pursuit of someone
who arguably does not.

131
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,146
It's time someone looked you in the eye
and told it to you straight.

132
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:57,955
I don't need parents to play
make-believe with. I got a mom.

133
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:58,966
Yes.

134
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,888
You're some detective.

135
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:06,599
Seventy-three Batsons between the ages of
28 to 40, and you've crossed out every one.

136
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,084
She's still out there. I know it.

137
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,158
There's a couple outside, Mr. Batson.

138
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:22,998
They run a group home.

139
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:26,138
I can take care of myself.

140
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,372
When you're 18.

141
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,601
Until then,
I won't have you living on the streets,

142
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,870
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

143
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,449
Give these people a chance.

144
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,216
'Cause that's what they're giving you.

145
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,356
You're out of options.

146
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:52,664
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

147
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:56,126
Just know that me and Rosa, we get it.
We were foster kids back in the day.

148
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:57,711
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

149
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:01,840
Girl, I'm young at heart.
I got my finger on the pulse.

150
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,780
Yeah, that's a reference
to his blood pressure because he's old.

151
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,345
Billy, do you have any food allergies?

152
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,117
Gonna wish you did. Darla's cooking.

153
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,019
What?

154
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:15,753
We know how overwhelming it can all be.
New house, new faces.

155
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,522
All up in your face.

156
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:20,081
Just take it at your own speed.

157
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,425
Hello?

158
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:36,817
We're home.

159
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,988
That's what happens when you suck!

160
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,056
So much for the welcome party.

161
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:45,409
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

162
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:46,943
Is that him?

163
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:48,644
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

164
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:50,196
Whoa! Slow down, slow down.

165
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:51,306
Welcome home!

166
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,291
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

167
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,325
Big hugger.

168
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,727
I noticed.

169
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,963
Die, die, die!

170
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,941
He doesn't mean that. It's a game.

171
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,517
Hey. No sodas after dark, remember?

172
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:07,840
Whoa. When did it get dark?

173
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,667
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

174
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,103
Oh, no!

175
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,363
Sorry, Pedro must've been working out.

176
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,495
His goal is to get swole.

177
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,276
Just one hit! Just one hit!

178
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,444
Oh...

179
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:21,695
Here.

180
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:26,658
Yes, exactly why your math department
is so uniquely suited for me.

181
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,226
Shut up! No!

182
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,527
I can't even with Eugene right now.

183
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,180
I'm sorry. Mary, hi. College interview.

184
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,918
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

185
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:39,479
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

186
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,048
What am I most excited about?

187
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:45,235
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

188
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,655
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

189
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,011
As a foster child, I'm a big believer
in finding family and friends

190
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,456
in the most unlikely of places.

191
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:59,541
I'm gonna miss that girl so much.

192
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,589
It's Caltech.
It's a very prestigious school.

193
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,436
And also all the way in California.

194
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,797
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

195
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,357
It's a tough subject for me.

196
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,592
Do you like vegan food?

197
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:10,744
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

198
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,556
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

199
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,291
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

200
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,062
Is that...

201
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,919
It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

202
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:22,814
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

203
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,425
Time to dance on your grave!

204
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,507
Watch the bum step.

205
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,488
Pedro...

206
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,394
Say hi to Billy.

207
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:34,753
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

208
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:39,597
Freddy.

209
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:44,236
This is Billy Batson.
Make sure you make him feel at home.

210
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,504
- Okay?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,363
Maybe don't say anything too weird?

212
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,527
Oh, one weird thing is,

213
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,980
did you know that Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

214
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,534
And apparently, it works.

215
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,373
Yep. Um...

216
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,673
Oh, it's a long way down.

217
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,352
Trust me, I speak from experience.

218
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,680
Victor pushed me.

219
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,470
They seem nice, but don't buy it.

220
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,477
It gets real Game of Thrones around here.

221
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,359
What?

222
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,462
Dude, I'm just messin' around.

223
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:32,274
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

224
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:36,221
Kidding, again!
You look at me, and you're like,

225
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,726
"Why so dark? You're a disabled foster kid.
You've got it all."

226
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,923
Right?

227
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,438
Oh, yeah, that's the old Batarang.

228
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,544
I mean, it's a replica, but feel how sharp.

229
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,389
I could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

230
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:51,803
You more of a Supes guy?

231
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,134
Yeah, me, too.

232
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:56,391
Behold, the holy grail.

233
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,077
One nine-millimeter round 
shot at Superman himself.

234
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,145
It's legit.

235
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,415
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

236
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:05,041
What's in the bag?

237
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,151
Hey.

238
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,696
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

239
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,313
You don't gotta talk so much, you know.

240
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,740
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

241
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,645
Dinner!

242
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,680
All hands on deck.

243
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,717
Thank you for this family.

244
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:57,265
Thank you for this day.

245
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,914
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

246
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:08,630
Big school. 2,000 students, 
you might think, "Wow, so many strangers."

247
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,165
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

248
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,589
Then it's, "Wow, so many friends."

249
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,727
The principal, her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

250
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:17,782
Next.

251
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:22,852
This is our security scanner.
Like in an airport. It's totally safe.

252
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,680
I know what it is.

253
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,024
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

254
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,343
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

255
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:31,829
She's almost never uncomfortable.

256
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
Have a good first day, big brother.

257
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,034
Look, you don't have to hug me
all the time.

258
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,415
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

259
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,375
I'm sorry.

260
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:50,704
I didn't mean to make her...

262
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:56,501
I was overwhelmed, honestly.

263
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:03,768
He said I must be pure of heart.
He call himself a wizard.

264
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:08,384
He even dressed like a wizard
from Harry Potter or some...

265
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:12,649
But you're saying that 
other people have experienced this?

266
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:16,516
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember what he said to you?

267
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,891
He tested me.

268
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,954
There were these statues.

269
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,254
Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.

270
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:27,813
Horrible things.

271
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,649
And do these approximate what you saw?

272
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:35,300
Yes, that's exactly how I remember it.

273
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,632
I don't understand. How do you know-

274
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,010
Recurrent imagery has proven very common
in cases of mass hysteria.

275
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,241
Mass hysteria?

276
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,003
I know. The term's a bit theatrical.

277
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:51,316
But take UFO sightings, for example.
Lights in the sky, flying saucers.

278
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,294
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other-

279
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,695
The symbols.

280
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,040
Ask her about the symbols.

281
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,931
Sorry, Miss Kwan.
But as an example of recurrent imagery,

282
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:11,634
maybe you'll recall seeing these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

283
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,532
I don't remember any symbols, no.

284
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:18,943
I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...

285
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:22,579
I remember the numbers on my alarm clock.
They kept shifting.

286
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:23,821
Video?

287
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,220
Show me the video.

288
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,126
Uh, Miss Kwan, this is Dr. Sivana.

289
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:33,417
Um, one moment, I can send it.

290
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,759
Hello?

291
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,352
Oh, my God! Who's there?

292
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:42,399
Hello? What's going on?
What's happening?

293
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,290
I-I'm going to call the police!

294
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,251
Then this blinding light all around me

295
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:52,529
and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.

296
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:55,432
It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.

297
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,754
He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.

298
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,381
...and how you were brought there
to save the world.

299
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,399
Dr. Sivana!

300
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:10,937
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

301
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:13,965
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

302
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,292
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

303
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,852
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

304
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:35,649
Doctor, what is all this?

305
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:38,298
All these years...

306
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,362
...I was convinced 
I had the incorrect sequence.

307
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:49,976
Or perhaps the wrong symbols
to open the door.

308
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:55,727
But on that woman's alarm clock,
the seven symbols.

309
00:23:57,066 --> 00:24:03,048
The sequence repeated itself seven times.

310
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:06,301
That's the difference.

311
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,369
Is this some sort of joke?

312
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:10,388
It may seem that way to you

313
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:14,321
because we're not in actuality 
studying mass hysteria.

314
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:16,450
What all these people have seen,

315
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,024
every single one of them, 
is absolutely real.

316
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,152
An alarm clock malfunctions

317
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:27,180
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

318
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,449
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

319
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:31,618
You can't believe any of this is real.

320
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:45,930
Why, yes.

321
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,599
Yes, I do.

322
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:36,657
I've been waiting for this moment
for so long...

323
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,697
...and now here we are.

324
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,329
You don't remember me, do you?

325
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:51,118
I remember you.

326
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:54,033
You were a boy.

327
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:56,060
And now you dare intrude in my kingdom.

328
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:59,829
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

329
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,728
No, you don't.

330
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,859
What you said to me all those years ago
made me realize who I really was.

331
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,417
And you know something?

332
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:13,337
I am not pure of heart.

333
00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:18,322
The wizard is too weak to stop us.

334
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:22,061
No!

335
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:23,407
No!

336
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:35,220
You never found your champion.

337
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,329
But we found ours.

338
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:58,545
You are the true champion.

339
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,381
They're using you.

340
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:34,223
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

341
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,084
Through you, they'll spread their poison
to everything they touch!

342
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,186
Make mankind turn on each other!

343
00:27:48,023 --> 00:27:50,608
You seek a pure soul, old man,

344
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,802
but no one's worthy.

345
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,754
Flight or invisibility?

346
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,250
If you could have one superpower,

347
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:09,235
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

348
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,021
I mean, everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

349
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,923
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

350
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,366
No, no. 'Cause heroes fly.

351
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,519
And who doesn't want people to think
they're a hero, right?

352
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:21,027
But invisibility, no way.
I mean, that's pervy.

353
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,691
Spying around on people
who don't even know you're there.

354
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:25,605
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

355
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:34,834
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

356
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:37,044
They asked people the same question.
You know, what power do you want?

357
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:39,130
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

358
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,310
And most people, since they knew
that it was secret, said invisibility.

359
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:46,137
And I think that's 'cause most people don't
feel like heroes on the inside, deep down.

360
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:47,613
You're gonna run away.

361
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:50,637
I mean, you stole my Superman bullet.

362
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,962
Dude, I get it. I get it.

363
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:55,957
You've been screwed over way 
too many times. You don't trust anyone.

364
00:28:56,365 --> 00:29:00,230
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

365
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:03,790
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

366
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:11,160
Hey. How was it today?

367
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,546
That good, huh'?

368
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:17,480
Whoa!

369
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:20,218
Oh, my God!

370
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,866
Freddy. Are you okay?

371
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,308
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

372
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:27,722
What the hell? What is wrong with you two?

373
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,957
No way that's gonna buff out.

374
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,317
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

375
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:34,128
For the dent you made almost hitting me?
Yeah, sure. Um...

376
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:35,301
You guys take these?

377
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,754
Brett, stop!

378
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:43,679
Don't touch my brother!

379
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:45,571
What, do you need your fake family
to stand up for you?

380
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,381
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

381
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,077
Hey, Freeman. Freeman, here, stand up.

382
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,186
Stand up for yourself.

383
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,994
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

384
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,420
Oh, yeah. You don't have a mommy.

385
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:57,392
Hey.

386
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,989
Man, sorry about that.

387
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,676
That wasn't fair, but then again
you don't fight fair, so...

388
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:12,402
Back off, assbags.
I know how to use these things.

389
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,653
Hey! He's getting away!

390
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:20,707
Where you going?

391
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:22,590
Freddy, are you okay?

392
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,730
- Hey, let's go through the back.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:35,956
Nowhere to run!

394
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,176
Hey!

395
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,082
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

396
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:41,487
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

397
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:42,644
Whoa!

398
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,725
No, no, no.

399
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,666
- You're dead, kid.
- Yeah, you think you're funny.

400
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:50,747
We know where you go to school, buddy!

401
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:55,943
Woman on PM Next stop,
30th Street Station.

402
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,238
Change for the regional rail lines.

403
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:18,314
Hello?

404
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,697
What's going on?

405
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,290
Help!

406
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:51,791
Okay.

407
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:08,975
Holy moly.

408
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:26,663
Hello?

409
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:42,710
What the hell?

410
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:44,960
Wh-Who's doing this?

411
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,286
Hi. Um...

412
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,655
I was supposed to get off at 30th.

413
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,889
Billy Batson.

414
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:24,803
How'd you know my name?

415
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:28,670
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

416
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,038
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

417
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,935
Oh... You're...

418
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:37,496
...that guy.

419
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,331
Hey, listen, I don't have any money.

420
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:41,358
Do not patronize me, boy.

421
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:47,288
You are standing in 
the source of all magic.

422
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:52,595
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

423
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:58,000
But long ago, we chose a champion
and we chose recklessly.

424
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,586
He used his power for revenge,

425
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:08,615
releasing the Seven Deadly Sins
into your world.

426
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:19,592
Millions of lives were lost.
Entire civilizations erased from existence.

427
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:27,296
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

428
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:31,569
until I find one truly good person.

429
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:36,664
Strong in spirit, pure in heart.

430
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:43,333
Look, man, maybe this is magic
and, I don't know,

431
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,524
but the people you're looking for,
good, pure people,

432
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:47,952
I'm not one of them.

433
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,967
I don't know if anyone is, really.

434
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,436
You, Billy Batson,

435
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,659
are all I have.

436
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:58,894
All the world has.

437
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,348
Lay your hands on my staff.

438
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:04,416
Gross.

439
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:08,028
And say my name
so my powers may flow through you.

440
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:11,186
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

441
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:15,444
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

442
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:16,960
Thanks.

443
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:20,069
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

444
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:23,853
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

445
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:26,803
Their thrones lie empty.

446
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:29,925
My magic must be passed on.

447
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,749
Now, speak my name!

448
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:36,045
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

449
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:40,978
My name is... Shazam.

450
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,331
Wait, for real?

451
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:45,889
- Say it!
- Okay!

452
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,735
Jeez.

453
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:01,199
So just say it'? Like...

454
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:03,113
Shazam?

455
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,127
Yes!

456
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:08,647
Carry my name,
and with it, you carry all my powers.

457
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:11,467
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

458
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:14,787
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

459
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:18,418
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

460
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:30,806
What happened to me? Why am...

461
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,130
Wh-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

462
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:36,856
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

463
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:41,705
With your heart, 
unlock your greatest power.

464
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,684
The thrones of
our brothers and sisters await.

465
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,910
Get me outta here!

466
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:02,707
Dope!

467
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,311
My brother, I applaud your choices today.

468
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,089
Gold shoes, gold belt, white cape.

469
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:13,582
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

470
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:23,956
Hey!

471
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,876
Hey, babe!

472
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,527
Yes, Officer.
I'm aware he's run away in the past.

473
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,012
Twenty-three times?

474
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:43,851
Guy's got no social media presence.
At all.

475
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:45,316
The guy is a ghost.

476
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:12,004
You know, guys, I'm happy to look
for Billy. More than happy.

477
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:14,690
But no, you gotta wash the dishes.
That's what's more important.

478
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:16,290
"What are you gonna do, Freddy, 
run after him?"

479
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:18,410
Very funny.

480
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,155
No, I said, don't scream.

481
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,681
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

482
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,199
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

483
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:25,426
It's Billy!

484
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:28,287
You asked me flight or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

485
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:30,504
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

486
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,777
Meet me back here after lights-out?

487
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:35,746
'Sup, bud? You all right?

488
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,947
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

489
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:43,010
I'm really sad because Billy's gone.

490
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:46,663
And, you know, maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

491
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:48,515
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

492
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,191
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

493
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,371
We'll find him, 'kay?

494
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,381
You don't snore that bad.

495
00:38:56,629 --> 00:38:57,981
But you kinda smell.

496
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,245
Oh, thank God!

497
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,129
Hey. Stop right there.

498
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:14,833
How do I know you're not a supervillain
using telepathic abilities

499
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,732
to make me believe that you're Billy? Huh?

500
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:17,356
What?

501
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,998
All I have to do is 
press "dial" on this thing.

502
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,449
No! No., I have proof. I have proof. Here.

503
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:24,512
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

504
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:26,840
- Oh, no! No., no, no.
- No!

505
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,264
Stupid adult hands.

506
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:30,588
But you saw it.

507
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:34,228
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

508
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:36,161
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

509
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,371
but you're the only person
that I know

510
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:39,363
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

511
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:41,309
- That's Batman.
- What?

512
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,485
Forget it.

513
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:46,027
Can I...

514
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:49,020
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

515
00:39:56,992 --> 00:39:59,309
Oh... oh, my God!

516
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:01,879
It's crazy, right?

517
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:03,926
What are your superpowers?

518
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,840
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even know
how to pee in this thing.

519
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,731
Okay. Can you fly?

520
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:13,445
Okay! Let's do this.

521
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:15,020
How do we do this?

522
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:17,740
Just, um, like, Superman it.

523
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:24,297
Oh, my God. Obviously, you have to jump. 
Come on.

524
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:26,155
How is any of this obvious?

525
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,264
Okay.

526
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,806
Try, uh, to believe that you can fly. Okay?

527
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:33,802
I read this deep dive into
peer-reviewed studies about superpowers

528
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:36,732
and in six out of ten, belief is the key.

529
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:39,334
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay. Okay.
I believe I can fly.

530
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,848
I believe I...

531
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,905
I believe I can fly.

532
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:44,163
I believe...

533
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,699
Did you believe?

534
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,254
Yeah.

535
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:00,027
You wanna try invisibility?

536
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,633
How do I do...

537
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,201
Forget it. You know, okay.

538
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:05,936
Okay, okay, okay.

539
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,235
Oh, my God! It worked!

540
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:13,082
Where'd you go?

541
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,558
I'm right here. You can't see me?

542
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,705
Where?

543
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:18,957
I'm invisible!

544
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:20,387
I'm right here. Over here.

545
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,588
I'm invisible! I'm invisible!

546
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:25,572
Hey!

547
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,058
Nice outfit, dipshit.

548
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:33,413
I might've been testing invisibility
and super-intelligence at the same time.

549
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,691
Freeman, I'm gonna come over there
and beat you.

550
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,866
Oh, my God! The lightning emblem!

551
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,269
It was staring us right in the face
the whole time.

552
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,598
Literally!

553
00:41:58,686 --> 00:41:59,723
Okay, okay.

554
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,531
Clearly, we gotta give you
a lightning-themed superhero name.

555
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:02,724
Yeah.

556
00:42:14,138 --> 00:42:15,097
Oh, right.

557
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:16,176
Hey, yo! Back...

558
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:19,226
...off.

559
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:21,629
Hyper-speed, check.

560
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,003
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

561
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,840
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

562
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:28,316
I doused him with pepper spray.

563
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:29,836
Smart move.

564
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:33,490
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

565
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:34,891
I'm your age.

566
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:37,520
And he didn't get a chance to take it
'cause I didn't let him take it.

567
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:40,597
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

568
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:42,499
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

569
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:46,387
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

570
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:47,762
So get woke, bro.

571
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:49,339
I'm sorry, who are you?

572
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:52,359
His name is Thundercrack,

573
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:56,054
hero to the people with all the power 
and speed of lightning all in one.

574
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,519
Dude, that sounds like a butt thing.

575
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,584
Mister Philadelphia.

576
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:01,969
That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

577
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:03,443
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got all the powers.

578
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:06,231
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

579
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:08,637
Power Boy, do you know this child?

580
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:13,121
Like a teeny little bit. 
I don't really know-

581
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,721
Yeah. He's like a little miniature manager.

582
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,082
I'm his manager.

583
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,043
But Power Boy's not gonna work,
either, okay? So work on something else.

584
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,730
Hey, bud, what could...

585
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,979
Electricity manipulation, hyper-speed,
super-strength.

586
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:31,214
Dude, you're stacked!

587
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,190
You're almost as cool as Superman.
Almost.

588
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:35,410
I didn't see you.
I don't know what just happened here.

589
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:37,304
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

590
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:38,945
Thank you for your kind donation.

591
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:40,405
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

592
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,502
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

593
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,478
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

594
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:48,315
Seventy-three bucks?

595
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,841
Come on!

596
00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:54,012
Hey, wait a minute. I just got an idea.

597
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:57,684
I'd like to purchase
some of your finest beer, please.

598
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:19,471
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

599
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:23,572
Freddy, Freddy, would you relax?
Look at me. I am the fake ID.

600
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,125
Everything from the register! Go, go!

601
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:27,270
Now!

602
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:29,502
Come on! We don't have any time.
Let's go. Move!

603
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:31,091
We want it all! Hurry.

604
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,587
This is your chance.

605
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:34,650
Oh! Okay.

606
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,961
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

607
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:40,056
That's it. That's it.

608
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,744
Gentlemen, why use guns 
when we can handle this like real men?

609
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:49,103
Billy, look out!

610
00:45:02,004 --> 00:45:04,892
Bullet immunity. You have bullet immunity!

611
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,407
I'm bulletproof.

612
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:12,728
Today is December 8th,
and this is video proof of authenticity.

613
00:45:13,553 --> 00:45:14,744
Shoot him again.

614
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:16,923
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here.
Go. Both of you!

615
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,478
Come on. Go to town.

616
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,480
Wait, wait, wait.

617
00:45:26,505 --> 00:45:29,931
We still don't know 
if the suit is bulletproof, or if you are.

618
00:45:31,335 --> 00:45:32,294
Shoot him in the face.

619
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,298
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

620
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,447
It kinda tickles.

621
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,892
You're dead.

622
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:53,205
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

623
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,142
But you're welcome for not getting robbed!

624
00:45:55,592 --> 00:45:58,119
Come on! Let's get outta here.

625
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:00,055
Hey.

626
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:01,932
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

627
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,830
That tastes like actual vomit.

628
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:12,793
Hey, do you know habanero jerky,

629
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:15,612
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole in your stomach?

630
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:16,780
Worth it.

631
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:19,683
Yeah. Probably not you, though.
You've probably got stomach superpowers.

632
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,181
Probably. Oh, hey.

633
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:22,511
What's up? I'm a superhero.

634
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:25,705
Yeah, his name is, uh,
Captain Sparklefingers.

635
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,959
No, it's not. No, it's not!

636
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:27,974
That's not my name.

637
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:30,205
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

638
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,002
Oh, okay. I'm out.

639
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:33,431
Hey, wait up!

640
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:42,103
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

641
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:45,486
I totally get why Rocky
was training so hard to get up here.

642
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:50,439
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

643
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,203
I mean, no offense, but, like,

644
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:57,658
at first you were kinda like
the opposite of how Darla is.

645
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:00,524
A dick?

646
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:02,843
Your words. Not mine.

647
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,286
But yeah.

648
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:09,538
All right, well, I feel like every criminal
is either on drugs or asleep by now.

649
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:11,283
Wanna head home?

650
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,333
Looking like this?

651
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,369
Well, yeah, I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair to go back to,

652
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:19,587
but that's long-term.

653
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,025
Right now, we have a bunk bed.

654
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:29,060
Just scares me thinking of him 
out there all alone.

655
00:47:29,085 --> 00:47:31,259
This is what he does, Rosa.

656
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,940
Difference is, when they find him,
we'll be the first to take him back.

657
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:38,635
With open arms.

658
00:47:40,937 --> 00:47:43,869
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

659
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,294
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

660
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:48,043
At least I did.

661
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:49,587
Yeah.

662
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:52,356
Even Mary did it. Hmm? Twice.

663
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:58,520
That second time she ran off, you said 
something to me I'll never forget.

664
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:00,383
You said,

665
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:04,512
"It's not a home until you call it a home. 
It's something you choose."

666
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:10,348
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

667
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:14,230
Whether he chooses to call it a home,
that's up to him.

668
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,520
Yeah.

669
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:20,806
You gonna help me with this tree?

670
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:23,911
This tree's so sad.

671
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,619
Hello?

672
00:48:27,702 --> 00:48:29,426
Got lost finding the bathroom.

673
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:31,725
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie. Good night.

674
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,059
- Good night.
- Night.

675
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,412
Freddy, who is that?

676
00:48:36,437 --> 00:48:39,356
It's Billy. He's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

677
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:40,565
What? Laryngitis!

678
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,748
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

679
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:43,291
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go to beddy-bye.

680
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:45,595
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

681
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,301
Billy, you're back. Let us see you.

682
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:49,778
We've been so worried about you.

683
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,310
I told you this was a bad idea!

684
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:53,937
Freddy?

685
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:56,075
Freddy, what happened to the stairs?

686
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:00,183
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

687
00:49:00,193 --> 00:49:02,036
is not gonna make her less scared, okay?

688
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,783
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

689
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:08,508
- A wizard made me look like this.
- Maybe don't start with "wizard".

690
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,278
It's just gonna make her more confused.

691
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:13,389
Some old guy brought me to a temple
and he made me say, "Shazam".

692
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,036
Rosa!

693
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,150
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

694
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:20,841
You can switch by saying, "Shazam".

695
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:25,561
Baby, was that you? Are you okay?

696
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:28,972
Uh... I was screwing in a bulb.

697
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:32,475
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot tell
anybody about this, all right?

698
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,585
But it's Billy. He's a hero.

699
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,519
Yeah, but if a supervillain finds out
that he's a hero, that endangers us, okay?

700
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:40,497
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

701
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,352
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

702
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:43,755
- Moderate.
- No.

703
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,966
Oh, God.

704
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:49,239
Okay, listen, D, you cannot tell a
single soul about this, all right? Please?

705
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,833
Why? What if it's people we trust?

706
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:56,919
Because good sisters don't tell secrets.

707
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:59,352
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

708
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,119
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

709
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:03,356
Is if you fixed the doorknob for us, okay?

710
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:05,383
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

711
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:07,012
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

712
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:14,181
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

713
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:15,583
Hi. Sir?

714
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:18,661
Sir, you can't go in there. Excuse me!

715
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:20,645
Y-You cannot go in there!

716
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:26,373
Sorry I'm late.

717
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,862
Thad, this is for board members only.

718
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,263
I'm aware of that, Father.

719
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,541
Now, that night in the car.

720
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:43,301
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

721
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,537
So much easier to blame me, wasn't it?

722
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,842
And say that if I hadn't screamed
that night,

723
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:51,575
you'd still have your legs.

724
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:54,536
Well, now I have proof.

725
00:50:57,285 --> 00:50:58,828
That's enough, Thad.

726
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:01,689
Dear Sid, you think?

727
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:07,137
You know, even before the accident,
you belittled me.

728
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:09,581
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

729
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,309
You don't need to make a scene.

730
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:13,994
Oh, brother,

731
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:16,755
the scene has only just begun.

732
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,809
Ask that if you can throw me out.

733
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:23,019
What?

734
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:25,903
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

735
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:31,450
Let me spoil it for you.

736
00:51:39,932 --> 00:51:43,385
Outlook not so good.

737
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:50,065
I've come here during the season of giving
to give you...

738
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,156
...what you deserve.

739
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,901
Run!

740
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:54,705
Oh, my God! No!

741
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:56,932
No! No!

742
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,524
Help!

743
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:15,437
Somebody!

744
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,131
Help me!

745
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:20,744
You can't go crying to other people
all the time.

746
00:53:22,538 --> 00:53:25,783
What sin best befits you, Father? Hmm?

747
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:28,049
I'll give you anything.

748
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:29,494
Money.

749
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:31,721
The company. You want the company?

750
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:33,666
There it is.

751
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:36,472
Greed.

752
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:43,441
Do you honestly think
all this material you've accumulated...

753
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:47,459
...amounts to actual power?

754
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:52,866
This is power.

755
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:55,850
More than you ever had.

756
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:58,811
More than anyone has.

757
00:53:59,662 --> 00:54:03,165
There is one more powerful.

758
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:07,706
The wizard found his champion.

759
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:13,362
Kill the champion
before he learns his true potential,

760
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:16,515
or he will defeat you.

761
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,417
Show me where to find him.

762
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:35,272
Oh, Greed,

763
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:38,280
you can have him.

764
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:40,425
No.

765
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,584
No... Oh, no!

766
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,655
No! No! No!

767
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,610
Family is more than just a word.

768
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:14,121
At Sivana Industries, our focus is family.

769
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:40,056
Uh, Burke.

770
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:44,097
Where's the truck?

771
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:54,553
I can hear it.

772
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:06,219
Oh, my God!

773
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:07,606
My truck!

774
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,408
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

775
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:11,863
You know, guys,

776
00:56:12,442 --> 00:56:14,236
I don't think that's gonna buff out.

777
00:56:23,235 --> 00:56:24,153
Hey.

778
00:56:24,178 --> 00:56:26,681
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

779
00:56:26,706 --> 00:56:28,866
I'm a better lookout. I can play innocent.

780
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:30,143
And I can't?

781
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:34,914
Your face gives off a very strong vibe
of someone who's hatching schemes.

782
00:56:34,939 --> 00:56:37,358
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:56:37,383 --> 00:56:38,676
Okay.

784
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:45,949
You boys got a hall pass?

785
00:56:46,576 --> 00:56:48,911
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

786
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:50,756
You!

787
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:55,184
You look like you're up to something.

788
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:58,655
Me? Up to something?
No. Never am I up to something.

789
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,024
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

790
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:03,943
The business office.

791
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:05,511
The business office, huh?

792
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:07,252
Sure, kid.

793
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:13,037
Look, parents or guardians must
appear physically to check out students.

794
00:57:13,603 --> 00:57:15,062
Gotcha.

795
00:57:15,087 --> 00:57:17,005
Okay, well, you hear that, Dad?

796
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:18,583
- Hey!
- Shazam!

797
00:57:18,608 --> 00:57:20,443
Well, hey there, son,

798
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:22,220
and hey there,
other son that I also have

799
00:57:22,245 --> 00:57:24,627
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

800
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:28,826
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

801
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:31,095
doing all the work stuff.

802
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,016
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

803
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:35,958
Oh.

804
00:57:35,983 --> 00:57:37,998
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

805
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:40,229
That's not funny.

806
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:42,291
I'm gonna talk to him about that.

807
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:43,341
I apologize.

808
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:46,202
Anyway, this is me appearing physically
to check my sons out of school.

809
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:50,513
So, thank you so much for
keeping 'em safe, Detective Moron.

810
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:55,177
It's Moran.

811
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,193
- You ready?
- Algebra!

812
00:57:58,806 --> 00:57:59,951
Science!

813
00:58:00,983 --> 00:58:02,177
English!

814
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:05,521
Health!

815
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:18,920
Oh. Oh.

816
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,073
Are you okay?

817
00:59:17,602 --> 00:59:19,151
I'm sorry!

818
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:44,353
More powerful than a locomotive.

819
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:46,901
Locomotive.
What are you? An old prospector?

820
00:59:47,555 --> 00:59:49,931
Can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

821
00:59:54,247 --> 00:59:55,401
Single bound.

822
00:59:57,815 --> 00:59:58,839
Oh!

823
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:01,812
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! 
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

824
01:00:01,837 --> 01:00:03,180
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

825
01:00:03,205 --> 01:00:04,832
Your phone's charged.

826
01:00:04,857 --> 01:00:06,100
Your phone's charged.

827
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:09,503
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

828
01:00:09,528 --> 01:00:12,381
I've been thinking about that.
What about this?

829
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:14,901
"That's why you don't mess 
with electricity."

830
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:17,136
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of your superpowers.

831
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:18,788
And your phone's charged.

832
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:20,234
Well, you think you can do better?

833
01:00:20,258 --> 01:00:21,184
What the hell?

834
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:23,386
Let there be light.

835
01:00:26,652 --> 01:00:28,862
Yeah, yeah, baby. Yeah, baby, okay.

836
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:35,613
How do I... Never mind.

837
01:00:35,638 --> 01:00:36,639
Shazam!

838
01:00:40,476 --> 01:00:41,753
Shazam!

839
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,520
What'd you see? What'd you see?
Were there boobies?

840
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,774
You see nipples? Why aren't you talking?

841
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:57,400
We're gonna need more money.

842
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:58,933
Why? You were in there for, 
like, five minutes.

843
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,460
Dude, they were very convincing!

844
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:07,094
Oh, get it, get it!

845
01:01:08,754 --> 01:01:09,914
Go, go, go!

846
01:01:15,678 --> 01:01:16,922
No!

847
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:18,931
Stop! No!

848
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:20,123
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

849
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:21,617
- I'm not even looking! 
- Stop!

850
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,355
- Oh, and done!
- Why?

851
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,813
Finished him.

852
01:01:29,692 --> 01:01:31,235
A lair.

853
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:32,445
Yes.

854
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:35,372
And obviously, we're gonna have to
be making this purchase anonymously.

855
01:01:35,823 --> 01:01:36,949
Obviously.

856
01:01:36,974 --> 01:01:41,662
And, um, if you have a location on a cliff.
Like a castle-esque type thing.

857
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,472
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

858
01:01:43,497 --> 01:01:45,249
seas, below it. Rough, you know...

859
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:46,484
Like a waterfall,

860
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:48,877
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

861
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:51,522
Look, Maximum Voltage, is it?

862
01:01:51,547 --> 01:01:53,422
You can call me Max.

863
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:57,078
Look, Max, why don't you just start with
how many bedrooms you're looking for?

864
01:01:57,492 --> 01:01:58,487
- One!
- Seven.

865
01:01:58,512 --> 01:01:59,111
One?

866
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,529
Seven? What, 
am I running a foster home now?

867
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:15,337
Have you seen the one
where he throws the football into space?

868
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:16,362
So dope.

869
01:02:16,405 --> 01:02:18,405
Hey, you guys
gotta wonder who's filming those, right?

870
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,586
I mean, that's bravery in and of itself.

871
01:02:20,716 --> 01:02:22,094
I mean, is it, though?

872
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,413
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

873
01:02:24,438 --> 01:02:25,672
Holding a camera?

874
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,559
Staring in the face of danger.

875
01:02:28,584 --> 01:02:30,024
Like some weirdo fanboy.

876
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:32,813
Hey, Freeman.

877
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:34,799
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

878
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:37,680
What, is your bestie gonna hit us
with a wheelchair this time?

879
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,554
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

880
01:02:39,579 --> 01:02:41,459
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

881
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:43,199
Okay, Freddy.

882
01:02:43,224 --> 01:02:46,593
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

883
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:50,648
Frequency Flinger. Sir Zaps-A-Lot.
Yeah. He's a man of many names.

884
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:51,957
You know the Red Cyclone?

885
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:54,735
You? My ass you do.

886
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,595
Oh, we're a lot closer than you think.

887
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:58,756
Maybe even at this very moment.

888
01:02:58,906 --> 01:02:59,867
Prove it.

889
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:02,406
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna come to lunch.

890
01:03:03,051 --> 01:03:04,428
Right, right, Billy?

891
01:03:04,453 --> 01:03:07,053
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's
gonna be bringing us dessert, right?

892
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,669
Tomorrow at lunch. You'll see.

893
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,375
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

894
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:21,696
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

895
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:25,074
Except when it makes you look cool,
then it's all good.

896
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:28,352
Billy, it's not like they're supervillains.
They're just super douchebags.

897
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:31,055
So, you're breaking your own rule?

898
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,305
Got it.

899
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:35,609
This thing is as much as mine
as it is yours.

900
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,985
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

901
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,427
Billy, you're still gonna do it,
though, right?

902
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,774
I mean, what would a good brother do?

903
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,778
All hands on deck.

904
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:53,305
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

905
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,899
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

906
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,477
Big news in Philly. Got a costumed hero.

907
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:05,016
He's doing good.

908
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,789
Yeah, but is he, though?

909
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:10,260
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

910
01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:13,274
Share with us your perspective, Eugene.

911
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:16,625
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

912
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,709
So what?
I can charge a phone with a plug.

913
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:20,899
Preach.

914
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:23,490
Pedro, any thoughts?

915
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:25,696
Costume's stupid.

916
01:04:26,243 --> 01:04:27,411
- Yeah.
- Okay.

917
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:29,680
Big white cape like
he's getting married or something.

918
01:04:29,705 --> 01:04:33,828
What if he didn't get to pick 
his costume? Ever think about that?

919
01:04:34,346 --> 01:04:36,186
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

920
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:40,024
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see the positive.

921
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,257
Okay, Well, I think it looks like

922
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:44,282
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

923
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:47,031
Very specific. All right.

924
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:50,070
Maybe to the superhero, gratitude
doesn't mean having to be clingy.

925
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,642
Clingy? Wow, interesting take.

926
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:55,915
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just wants a little me time.

927
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,068
You know, me time could also be
construed as pushing away his family.

928
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:01,170
Family. Is that what they are now?

929
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:03,280
It's a classic symptom of
"Superhero Syndrome."

930
01:05:03,305 --> 01:05:06,850
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

931
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:10,045
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

932
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:13,515
Son, we're still eating dinner.

933
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,292
What he needs is a sidekick.

934
01:05:15,317 --> 01:05:17,071
Name one cool sidekick.

935
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:20,255
Darla, why are you so quiet 
over there, baby?

936
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:22,483
You're never at a loss for words.

937
01:05:22,508 --> 01:05:24,093
I'm eating.

938
01:05:34,895 --> 01:05:36,755
Why am I still doing this?

939
01:05:36,897 --> 01:05:38,935
Well, you can't skip every day.

940
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,841
Not at your age.

941
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:43,099
But I'm not your age anymore.

942
01:05:43,737 --> 01:05:44,989
But I can go with you.

943
01:05:45,014 --> 01:05:47,600
We just gotta trick the guard out,
you know?

944
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,502
Billy, where are you going?

945
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,108
You're still gonna have lunch 
with me, right?

946
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,596
Billy!

947
01:05:52,621 --> 01:05:55,927
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's
still gonna eat in the cafeteria, right?

948
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,146
All right.

949
01:06:07,284 --> 01:06:08,982
Did you check it to...

950
01:06:09,164 --> 01:06:12,404
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

951
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,560
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

952
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,959
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

953
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:31,468
How do you know my name?

954
01:06:31,493 --> 01:06:33,771
Uh... How do I know your name? Uh...

955
01:06:34,178 --> 01:06:36,732
One of my superpowers is name guessing.

956
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:38,912
Which is really weird, I bet.

957
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:41,481
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

958
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:43,966
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

959
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:45,834
Are you hurt?

960
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:49,982
No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um...

961
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:54,060
I just need a second to think.

962
01:06:54,085 --> 01:06:55,951
This has been such a weird day.

963
01:06:55,976 --> 01:07:00,314
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

964
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:03,818
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college in your hand.

965
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:06,429
Are you upset because you didn't get in?

966
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:11,271
I got in.

967
01:07:13,486 --> 01:07:17,739
Well, now my superpowers
are failing me and I am very confused.

968
01:07:18,714 --> 01:07:20,466
Yeah. Me, too.

969
01:07:21,396 --> 01:07:23,077
I don't know. I know I should be excited

970
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:26,298
'cause this is my dream and I've worked
really, really hard for this,

971
01:07:26,986 --> 01:07:28,474
but it's like...

972
01:07:30,976 --> 01:07:33,479
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

973
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:36,591
Could I give you
a little piece of advice?

974
01:07:36,784 --> 01:07:40,496
Don't be worried about everybody else.
Always look out for number one.

975
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,480
Gandhi said that.

976
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,457
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

977
01:07:43,482 --> 01:07:45,265
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

978
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:46,225
"Take care of number one."

979
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:48,320
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

980
01:07:48,345 --> 01:07:49,546
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

981
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:52,616
Agree to disagree.
The point is, you do you, you know?

982
01:07:52,641 --> 01:07:56,505
You gotta look out for you. And get
as far away from this place as you can.

983
01:07:58,424 --> 01:08:00,140
I don't know if I want to.

984
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:01,750
Of course you do. What're you gonna do?

985
01:08:01,775 --> 01:08:03,833
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

986
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,388
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves, okay? So...

987
01:08:10,676 --> 01:08:12,719
And you can take care of yourself.

988
01:08:12,744 --> 01:08:14,794
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

989
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,783
I'll just call him. I'll just make sure.

990
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,459
It's ringing.

991
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:31,005
Red Cyclone, hey! Hey, what's going on?

992
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:33,465
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

993
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,868
Yeah, it's crazy! Great story.

994
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:38,552
He's not talking to anyone.

995
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:43,652
I was! I was! We're friends. 
I know him, I do!

996
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,708
I know him! I know him! Uh, yeah.

997
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:50,692
Shit.

998
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:56,196
Come on now.

999
01:08:56,221 --> 01:08:59,192
Hands! Lightning with my hands!

1000
01:08:59,317 --> 01:09:01,403
Lightning with my hands!

1001
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,662
Lightning with my hands!

1002
01:09:03,687 --> 01:09:04,980
Hey. Hey.

1003
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,594
Hey, young man! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1004
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,668
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

1005
01:09:09,693 --> 01:09:10,903
How can I help you?

1006
01:09:10,928 --> 01:09:13,328
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1007
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,122
Yeah, I got a little something
called a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

1008
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,158
I don't know if you've ever heard of it,

1009
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,246
but it's when someone grabs
your underwear like that

1010
01:09:21,271 --> 01:09:23,982
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

1011
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:26,505
And this was my underwear.

1012
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:30,310
Gross.

1013
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:32,014
You said you'd come.

1014
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:34,124
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

1015
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:35,861
I'm a superhero, dude!

1016
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,156
Well, you're acting real heroic.
How much people paying you today?

1017
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:42,476
Listen, I have
serious responsibilities now, okay?

1018
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,841
But that's cool because
I can carry that burden with my...

1019
01:09:44,866 --> 01:09:47,494
Hands! Lightning with my hands!

1020
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:08,153
Oh, man!

1021
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:15,013
Holy moly.

1022
01:10:17,465 --> 01:10:19,942
Don't move! Nobody move!

1023
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:29,831
Oh, no, no!

1024
01:10:29,856 --> 01:10:33,364
Oh, no, no, no! Stay, stay! Stay!

1025
01:10:41,827 --> 01:10:43,099
Oh!

1026
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:44,802
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

1027
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:47,666
It's him! It's that superhero guy!

1028
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:50,044
Help us! Save us!

1029
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:52,035
Come on!

1030
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,310
Come on...

1031
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:56,733
Yeah.

1032
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:59,013
What's he doing? What's going on?

1033
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:08,786
No way.

1034
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:18,661
Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1035
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,726
God, this is the worst idea ever!

1036
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:34,222
I did it! I did it!

1037
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:36,606
I got the bus! I got the bus.

1038
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:38,342
Nobody move in there.

1039
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,767
Oh, I gotta put this thing down.
I gotta put this thing down.

1040
01:11:46,224 --> 01:11:48,175
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Doggy, doggy, you have to move.

1041
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,993
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

1042
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:53,398
Please be a good dog, good dog!
You're being a bad dog!

1043
01:11:53,423 --> 01:11:54,966
Go! Go!

1044
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:57,575
Please go. Please move.

1045
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,714
Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1046
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:02,263
Thank you.

1047
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:21,013
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1048
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:23,082
I was in the neighborhood, you know,
so I thought...

1049
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:24,321
Thank you!

1050
01:12:24,346 --> 01:12:26,208
It was kind of my fault anyway.

1051
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,811
So, it seems Philadelphia has gotten
an early Christmas present

1052
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:36,632
in the form of its very own superhero.

1053
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:38,177
And we're out.

1054
01:12:38,678 --> 01:12:40,420
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1055
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:43,240
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1056
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,454
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1057
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,216
And then I caught it!

1058
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,890
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1059
01:12:51,915 --> 01:12:53,834
I caught a bus
like people catch fly balls.

1060
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:55,352
Like, who does that? I do that!

1061
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:56,753
Billy! You do nothing.

1062
01:12:56,778 --> 01:13:00,239
You take selfies and make people pay you.

1063
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:03,333
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1064
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:05,329
You just wish it was you.

1065
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:07,317
No shit!

1066
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,216
You think?
I would kill to have what you have.

1067
01:13:11,363 --> 01:13:13,406
Because everything I do is, like,

1068
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,540
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1069
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:18,608
To not feel sorry for me.

1070
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:21,380
I mean, look at me! Look at me.
Do you even see me?

1071
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:25,643
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

1072
01:13:26,514 --> 01:13:28,255
And now you don't either.

1073
01:13:28,673 --> 01:13:31,012
I mean, you think this is who you are?

1074
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:34,691
I mean, Billy, you're 14,
and now you're no better than the Breyers.

1075
01:13:35,205 --> 01:13:39,591
All this power, and all you did
was turn into a show-off and a bully.

1076
01:13:42,475 --> 01:13:43,476
Whatever, kid!

1077
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:44,958
I do what I want!

1078
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:49,302
And I'm, like, mid-20s probably!

1079
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:52,060
Maybe even, like, 30.

1080
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:56,677
Chosen one.

1081
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:02,481
The so-called perfect man.

1082
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:05,208
Pure of heart.

1083
01:14:06,296 --> 01:14:08,161
Flawless in every way.

1084
01:14:10,865 --> 01:14:12,345
What made you so worthy?

1085
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,806
I'm sorry, can I help...

1086
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,156
Do you want an autograph or something?

1087
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,792
Give me your power.

1088
01:14:20,182 --> 01:14:21,480
Or die.

1089
01:14:21,505 --> 01:14:24,841
Oh, snap!
You're, like, a bad guy, right?

1090
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:28,218
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets really stupid for you,

1091
01:14:28,243 --> 01:14:30,284
you should know that
I'm basically invincible, so-

1092
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,750
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

1093
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:43,604
I said, stop right there!

1094
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:46,409
The only thing that extinguishes magic...

1095
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:48,705
...is magic.

1096
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:52,245
Time to transfer your power to me.

1097
01:14:55,278 --> 01:14:58,391
Oh, you did not see that one coming,
did you, grandpa?

1098
01:14:58,502 --> 01:15:00,421
Them's street rules.

1099
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,179
Okay, okay, okay.

1100
01:15:11,204 --> 01:15:13,081
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1101
01:15:13,106 --> 01:15:16,223
I never should've punched you in the
nuts like that. That was totally my bad.

1102
01:15:16,226 --> 01:15:17,519
We can talk about this.

1103
01:15:17,544 --> 01:15:19,162
You grovel like a child.

1104
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:21,231
That's because I am one. I'm a kid!

1105
01:15:21,256 --> 01:15:22,815
You don't wanna hurt a kid, do you?

1106
01:15:25,777 --> 01:15:28,635
I believe I can fly!
I believe I can fly, I can fly!

1107
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,632
Freddy said if I believe I can fly,
then I can fly.

1108
01:15:30,657 --> 01:15:32,615
So I believe! I believe! I believe!

1109
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:33,534
Okay.

1110
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:34,643
Superman!

1111
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:36,589
Superman! What arm is it?

1112
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,402
Why am I not flying?

1113
01:15:38,427 --> 01:15:40,135
Please, I don't wanna die!

1114
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:04,385
I'm floating!

1115
01:16:11,323 --> 01:16:13,042
What the hell was that?

1116
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:19,039
I can fly!

1117
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:26,331
Billy?

1118
01:16:27,464 --> 01:16:29,268
Freddy! I need your help!

1119
01:16:29,633 --> 01:16:31,009
You can fly?

1120
01:16:38,975 --> 01:16:40,328
Who's the other guy?

1121
01:16:40,602 --> 01:16:41,728
Santa!

1122
01:16:44,856 --> 01:16:48,860
So, like, what do you and Mrs. Claus
do in the summertime?

1123
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:51,388
Well, in some ways,

1124
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:53,453
Santa is always here for you.

1125
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:01,633
Help Santa!

1126
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:04,727
Santa needs help! Help!

1127
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:06,461
Give us a shout if you need us.

1128
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,891
I'm just gonna chill in here
for a little while, if that's okay.

1129
01:17:19,453 --> 01:17:20,992
This is crazy.

1130
01:17:21,017 --> 01:17:22,509
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

1131
01:17:22,519 --> 01:17:24,646
This isn't your job. You can run, right?

1132
01:17:24,671 --> 01:17:26,798
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

1133
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:36,845
Get back!

1134
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:38,410
Get away!

1135
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,414
- I'm Batman!
- Get him, Batman!

1136
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,376
Oh, sorry.

1137
01:18:12,402 --> 01:18:13,891
Come on!

1138
01:18:39,345 --> 01:18:41,110
Sh-Shazam!

1139
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:12,594
Billy!

1140
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:14,883
Billy!

1141
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:17,828
Billy, where are you?

1142
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:21,813
Billy!

1143
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:24,140
Where are you, Billy?

1144
01:19:28,728 --> 01:19:30,104
Billy, come on!

1145
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:36,055
Billy. Where is he?

1146
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,457
Supervillain.

1147
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:40,125
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1148
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,516
Worse. Much worse.

1149
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:47,587
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

1150
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:50,999
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

1151
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:54,938
I don't need to read your mind.
Because you are going to tell me.

1152
01:19:55,919 --> 01:19:57,212
Where is he?

1153
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:11,187
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

1154
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,915
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1155
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,525
What happened? Are you hurt?

1156
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:17,819
- Come inside.
- We need to have a talk.

1157
01:20:19,057 --> 01:20:21,110
Just don't be so hard on him, okay?

1158
01:20:27,513 --> 01:20:29,889
Running out on us! Lying!

1159
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:33,418
Huh? Then I get a call from the school,
telling me you've been cutting class!

1160
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:34,961
Getting in fights!

1161
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,853
Bill, the man saved nine people.

1162
01:20:41,057 --> 01:20:42,934
Whoa! Is that...

1163
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,147
I'm questioning his motive.

1164
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:47,594
What's Freddy doing with a superhero?

1165
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:54,250
Or what's a superhero doing with Freddy?

1166
01:20:57,595 --> 01:20:59,002
You remember dinner,

1167
01:20:59,027 --> 01:21:03,110
when Billy and Freddy were arguing
like an old married couple, like this?

1168
01:21:04,144 --> 01:21:06,759
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

1169
01:21:06,784 --> 01:21:08,745
He knew my name. He called me Mary.

1170
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:20,964
Wait, are you saying 
Billy's the Human Power Storm?

1171
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:22,859
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1172
01:21:22,884 --> 01:21:24,344
All on your own. I didn't help.

1173
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:25,754
I didn't break any promises.

1174
01:21:25,778 --> 01:21:26,742
You knew?

1175
01:21:27,096 --> 01:21:28,781
I'm a good sister!

1176
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,602
I mean, what were you thinking?

1177
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,313
And then you bring Freddy into it.

1178
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:46,133
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

1179
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,381
Billy?

1180
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,873
You're him.

1181
01:22:04,688 --> 01:22:06,263
You're the hero.

1182
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:09,373
Yeah, well, not anymore, so...

1183
01:22:14,055 --> 01:22:16,265
Why do you have my notebook?

1184
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:20,287
Eugene finished your search.

1185
01:22:21,157 --> 01:22:23,493
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1186
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:26,022
But I have played Watch Dogs and Uplink.

1187
01:22:26,047 --> 01:22:28,236
And maybe I did pick up a few skills,

1188
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,219
which maybe did get me into federal
databases most people can't get into.

1189
01:22:31,244 --> 01:22:33,371
Good for you, but I'm gonna go.

1190
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:37,076
Your parents' names are
Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1191
01:22:42,453 --> 01:22:43,648
What?

1192
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:47,660
You were born in Zumbrota, Minnesota.
They divorced when you were three.

1193
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,781
Your mom moved here that year.
Twenty months later, you got lost.

1194
01:22:51,806 --> 01:22:55,852
You never found them 'cause your dad's
been in prison in Florida for ten years.

1195
01:22:55,877 --> 01:22:57,310
And your mom's...

1196
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,217
What?

1197
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:02,959
Is she dead?

1198
01:23:03,398 --> 01:23:05,256
She's two subway stops away.

1199
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,488
What?

1200
01:23:08,627 --> 01:23:11,672
You know, you didn't find her
because she reverted to her maiden name.

1201
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,201
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1202
01:23:21,951 --> 01:23:23,411
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

1203
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:25,673
Kids, stay here in case Billy comes back.

1204
01:23:32,472 --> 01:23:35,183
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1205
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:46,502
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

1206
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:49,238
No, we're gonna wait here for now.

1207
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:54,178
Billy?

1208
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:58,060
Freddy?

1209
01:24:02,186 --> 01:24:04,256
Oh, how quaint.

1210
01:24:07,392 --> 01:24:09,271
Actually, I take that back.

1211
01:24:11,257 --> 01:24:13,217
What a shithole.

1212
01:24:56,263 --> 01:24:57,722
Just a second.

1213
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,038
Hey, look, I'm late for work already,
all right?

1214
01:25:04,063 --> 01:25:06,277
We don't need any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

1215
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:07,823
Oh, I'm not.

1216
01:25:08,721 --> 01:25:11,057
You probably don't recognize me, but...

1217
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:14,044
...I found my way home.

1218
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:16,714
Mom.

1219
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:19,816
It's me.

1220
01:25:20,997 --> 01:25:22,198
Oh, God.

1221
01:25:23,616 --> 01:25:24,667
Is it?

1222
01:25:27,295 --> 01:25:29,338
Um... Hang on.

1223
01:25:30,638 --> 01:25:32,166
Who's at the door?

1224
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:34,667
It's, um...

1225
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,138
It's no one, Travis.

1226
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:43,680
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1227
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,938
No.

1228
01:25:46,606 --> 01:25:49,298
Listen, um...

1229
01:25:51,194 --> 01:25:52,438
It's really you, huh?

1230
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:58,659
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

1231
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:02,079
I let go, but it was by accident.

1232
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:03,844
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1233
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:06,173
I saw you.

1234
01:26:07,293 --> 01:26:08,377
What?

1235
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:13,174
I saw you after.

1236
01:26:15,968 --> 01:26:18,899
So, it was never your fault.

1237
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:24,344
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

1238
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:28,665
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1239
01:26:30,053 --> 01:26:32,860
And I was hurting, and I was screwed up.

1240
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:36,168
I want the tiger.

1241
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:41,204
I know. I know, honey, but Mom's
not exactly going pro here, okay?

1242
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:45,057
Billy?

1243
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,009
Billy!

1244
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,709
Billy?

1245
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:51,963
Jesus Christ. Billy, this isn't funny!

1246
01:26:51,988 --> 01:26:53,532
Here you go, buddy.

1247
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:56,550
That should warm you up. Is that better?

1248
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:02,483
Look, it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1249
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,635
I realized that they could do

1250
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,516
a better job taking care of you
than I ever will.

1251
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:14,696
But you're good, right?

1252
01:27:16,182 --> 01:27:18,392
I mean, you landed on your feet.

1253
01:27:19,226 --> 01:27:21,173
I mean, you look real good.

1254
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:24,570
It's just...

1255
01:27:26,815 --> 01:27:30,026
...now is not a really good time 
for me, Bill.

1256
01:27:34,422 --> 01:27:39,477
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

1257
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:44,028
but I have to get back
to my real family.

1258
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:47,352
Here.

1259
01:27:50,825 --> 01:27:51,946
What's this?

1260
01:27:52,616 --> 01:27:55,244
Marilyn! What's goin' on out there?

1261
01:27:56,011 --> 01:27:57,774
You might need it more than me.

1262
01:28:15,441 --> 01:28:18,149
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1263
01:28:18,174 --> 01:28:19,704
Come home, Billy.

1264
01:28:20,263 --> 01:28:21,761
Come home.

1265
01:28:21,786 --> 01:28:25,110
Billy! Supervillain! Supervillain!

1266
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:42,509
Shazam!

1267
01:28:56,587 --> 01:28:58,725
Who are you? What do you want?

1268
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,590
What do I want?

1269
01:29:00,972 --> 01:29:02,514
I want...

1270
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:08,803
That.

1271
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:11,060
Whoa.

1272
01:29:14,522 --> 01:29:16,273
Kick his ass, Billy!

1273
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:20,944
Yes, Billy.

1274
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:22,865
Try it, by all means.

1275
01:29:23,173 --> 01:29:25,216
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1276
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:27,301
No, first, you come inside,

1277
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:28,983
then maybe I'll let them go.

1278
01:29:46,037 --> 01:29:47,539
Good boy.

1279
01:29:50,187 --> 01:29:52,147
Because that's all you are, isn't it?

1280
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:54,286
How old are you?

1281
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:56,605
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

1282
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:02,586
When I was a child, the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1283
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:05,662
Yet here you are, a coward.

1284
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:11,178
Run from me and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1285
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:13,881
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1286
01:30:14,811 --> 01:30:16,642
Give me the power of the champion.

1287
01:30:16,667 --> 01:30:18,108
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1288
01:30:34,836 --> 01:30:37,297
Give me the power and I'll let them go.

1289
01:30:37,322 --> 01:30:38,668
Darla, no.

1290
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:40,465
Don't go, Billy.

1291
01:30:41,308 --> 01:30:43,324
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

1292
01:30:43,349 --> 01:30:45,184
No, I have to.

1293
01:30:45,605 --> 01:30:48,441
It's what a good brother would do.
Right?

1294
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:54,413
Billy.

1295
01:31:20,859 --> 01:31:23,570
I dedicated my life to getting here.

1296
01:31:24,534 --> 01:31:26,386
I scoured the earth.

1297
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,316
No one believed me.

1298
01:31:29,058 --> 01:31:30,988
No one helped.

1299
01:31:31,013 --> 01:31:32,431
Not the wizard.

1300
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:34,863
Not my family.

1301
01:31:36,687 --> 01:31:38,480
I only had myself.

1302
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:40,229
I get it.

1303
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:43,254
I get what that's like.

1304
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,107
Feeling like you're all alone in the world.

1305
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,092
Stand.

1306
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,379
Feeling like there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

1307
01:31:51,404 --> 01:31:53,364
then you'd finally be good enough.

1308
01:31:53,389 --> 01:31:54,488
Stand.

1309
01:31:56,972 --> 01:31:58,722
The champion's name.

1310
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:01,363
Say it.

1311
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:30,009
Look, no offense, mister,

1312
01:32:30,034 --> 01:32:32,636
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1313
01:32:33,129 --> 01:32:36,144
Don't listen to this child.

1314
01:32:36,528 --> 01:32:38,441
Take the staff.

1315
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:43,691
Hold it and say the champion's name.

1316
01:32:44,134 --> 01:32:45,941
They're using you.

1317
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:48,777
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1318
01:32:48,802 --> 01:32:50,183
Say your name.

1319
01:32:53,616 --> 01:32:54,715
His name...

1320
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:57,528
...is Captain Sparklefingers.

1321
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:01,824
And we're gonna keep throwing things 
at your big, fat, ugly-eyed head,

1322
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:03,847
until you let our brother go.

1323
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:30,558
Boy, am I glad I didn't sell that Batarang.

1324
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,905
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

1325
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,724
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1326
01:33:34,749 --> 01:33:35,989
Guys, I appreciate the thought,

1327
01:33:36,014 --> 01:33:38,131
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1328
01:33:38,156 --> 01:33:39,699
You can put 'em down now.

1329
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:42,595
The door was right here.

1330
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,136
Billy, how do we get outta here?

1331
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,063
What, you think I know? I don't know.

1332
01:33:46,936 --> 01:33:47,770
This way!

1333
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:49,230
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1334
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:50,214
Good job, Darla.

1335
01:33:50,227 --> 01:33:51,277
Go, go, go!

1336
01:33:51,302 --> 01:33:52,487
Kids?

1337
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:55,129
Why is this open?

1338
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:56,606
Freddy?

1339
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,855
Mary?

1340
01:34:01,308 --> 01:34:02,726
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1341
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:04,544
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

1342
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:06,136
Darla, stay in front.

1343
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:08,222
We gotta hurry.

1344
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:32,944
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

1345
01:34:33,658 --> 01:34:35,869
So many doors.

1346
01:34:36,277 --> 01:34:38,988
One of these has to be a way out, right?

1347
01:34:39,013 --> 01:34:40,306
Yeah, I would hope so.

1348
01:34:57,406 --> 01:34:58,626
Not this one.

1349
01:35:12,522 --> 01:35:14,607
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

1350
01:35:14,632 --> 01:35:16,692
Come on, Billy. What are we gonna do?

1351
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:17,801
Darla, I don't know.

1352
01:35:17,826 --> 01:35:20,328
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1353
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,560
Uh, last time, I thought about
the subway, and I was on the subway.

1354
01:35:22,585 --> 01:35:24,658
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1355
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:27,165
Think about any place 
except for here, okay?

1356
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,751
Come on, come on, come on.

1357
01:35:50,776 --> 01:35:52,603
Why are you covering my eyes?

1358
01:35:52,628 --> 01:35:55,255
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1359
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,482
You're welcome!

1360
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:58,133
Why can't I see what's inside?

1361
01:35:58,158 --> 01:35:59,617
You are not old enough.

1362
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:01,743
Old enough to know that was great music.

1363
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:03,388
Not my thing.

1364
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:04,656
Wh-Where's Freddy?

1365
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:05,849
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

1366
01:36:05,874 --> 01:36:07,584
Hey, have a holly jolly Christmas.

1367
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:09,077
Freddy! What are you doing?

1368
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:10,479
Nice people.

1369
01:36:10,504 --> 01:36:11,497
Nice people? Come on.

1370
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:13,555
Is that glitter?
They have glitter! Can I get glitter?

1371
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:15,665
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1372
01:36:15,696 --> 01:36:16,743
No..

1373
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:19,876
Darla.

1374
01:36:24,553 --> 01:36:26,681
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

1375
01:36:26,829 --> 01:36:28,368
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

1376
01:36:28,393 --> 01:36:29,978
One, two, three. Up, up. Up we go.

1377
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:40,025
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

1378
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,844
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

1379
01:36:53,469 --> 01:36:55,332
Don't run, but don't walk. Just be cool.

1380
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:58,026
Act naturally,
like kids naturally act in a carnival.

1381
01:36:58,051 --> 01:36:59,834
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1382
01:36:59,859 --> 01:37:01,479
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1383
01:37:01,504 --> 01:37:03,465
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

1384
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,075
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

1385
01:37:05,103 --> 01:37:06,446
Don't take pictures.

1386
01:37:08,412 --> 01:37:09,580
Shazam!

1387
01:37:16,712 --> 01:37:19,490
- Hey! Where'd he go?
- What, is he invisible now?

1388
01:37:26,828 --> 01:37:29,756
Oh, man, I just spit on a baby!

1389
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:32,769
Yo, what is that?

1390
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:37,670
Who is that guy?

1391
01:37:38,426 --> 01:37:40,186
Champion.

1392
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:45,202
You don't deserve that name.

1393
01:37:46,467 --> 01:37:49,136
See that? Look at that up there!

1394
01:37:49,161 --> 01:37:52,789
Hiding behind
innocent people who will now die.

1395
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:58,405
Because deep down
you're still just a scared little boy.

1396
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:01,965
Oh, no.

1397
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:05,844
Run! Run!

1398
01:38:18,743 --> 01:38:21,335
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

1399
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,124
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1400
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:34,081
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1401
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,323
Are you kidding?

1402
01:38:35,348 --> 01:38:38,612
Okay, no. Old guy's up there
harboring multiple spiritual entities.

1403
01:38:38,637 --> 01:38:42,353
Plus, he has the same powers as you.
Plus, I mean, he knows what he's doing.

1404
01:38:42,378 --> 01:38:44,581
Plus, I mean, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

1405
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:48,428
If a superhero can't save his family,

1406
01:38:49,747 --> 01:38:51,143
he's not much of a hero.

1407
01:38:55,686 --> 01:38:57,089
That was a decent catchphrase.

1408
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,897
Shazam!

1409
01:39:08,177 --> 01:39:09,923
Now, let's try this again.

1410
01:39:24,172 --> 01:39:25,821
Or try that again!

1411
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:34,990
Billy, look out!

1412
01:39:37,943 --> 01:39:40,372
Laser eyes! Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1413
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:42,693
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1414
01:39:52,443 --> 01:39:54,685
- That's his power matrix.
- His what-what?

1415
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:57,713
When the demon guys leave his eye,
he loses his powers.

1416
01:39:58,582 --> 01:40:00,326
That's why the Batarang hurt him.

1417
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:02,252
Hey!

1418
01:40:02,277 --> 01:40:03,381
Over here!

1419
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:06,481
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1420
01:40:06,506 --> 01:40:08,866
We separate the Sins from the eye,
and he's just an old man.

1421
01:40:09,371 --> 01:40:10,975
Gather the mutts.

1422
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:25,693
Run!

1423
01:40:32,385 --> 01:40:33,811
Darla, no!

1424
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:50,381
Here. Take it.

1425
01:40:50,406 --> 01:40:52,283
Take it. It's for you.

1426
01:40:52,424 --> 01:40:54,009
Hold it tight.

1427
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:57,199
Close your eyes. 
Everything's gonna be okay.

1428
01:40:57,224 --> 01:40:58,683
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1429
01:40:59,559 --> 01:41:00,685
Okay.

1430
01:41:41,017 --> 01:41:41,884
Shazam!

1431
01:42:04,402 --> 01:42:05,821
Shazam!

1432
01:42:11,065 --> 01:42:12,650
Playtime's over, boy.

1433
01:42:13,722 --> 01:42:15,610
Your friends can't help you anymore.

1434
01:42:15,635 --> 01:42:16,803
Shazam!

1435
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:22,559
Hey!

1436
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,326
Shazam!

1437
01:43:15,001 --> 01:43:16,711
Nice trick.

1438
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,014
Catchy.

1439
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:20,195
One simple word.

1440
01:43:20,574 --> 01:43:22,242
I have a better trick.

1441
01:43:23,078 --> 01:43:24,371
Four words.

1442
01:43:25,664 --> 01:43:26,831
Kill the little girl.

1443
01:43:26,856 --> 01:43:29,483
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

1444
01:43:33,838 --> 01:43:34,881
Stop!

1445
01:43:50,397 --> 01:43:53,149
Billy, there's one more demon guy 
in his eye!

1446
01:43:53,174 --> 01:43:55,293
You gotta just rip it out
of his face hole!

1447
01:43:55,318 --> 01:43:56,749
It's where he gets his power.

1448
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:02,460
Reach for it.

1449
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:05,069
I dare you.

1450
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:15,460
Wise decision.

1451
01:44:17,632 --> 01:44:19,217
Hands on the staff.

1452
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:22,112
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1453
01:44:22,137 --> 01:44:23,722
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

1454
01:44:23,747 --> 01:44:24,952
Don't!

1455
01:44:43,926 --> 01:44:47,694
<i>Say my name so my power
may flow through you.</i>

1456
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:55,026
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.
And in so doing, choose you as champion.

1457
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:59,132
With your heart, 
unlock your greatest power.

1458
01:44:59,316 --> 01:45:02,111
The thrones of 
our brothers and sisters await.

1459
01:45:10,541 --> 01:45:11,674
All hands on deck.

1460
01:45:17,108 --> 01:45:18,318
Say my name.

1461
01:45:19,694 --> 01:45:21,071
Billy!

1462
01:45:21,096 --> 01:45:24,038
No, not my name. Say the name
that I say to turn into this guy.

1463
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:26,424
Shazam!

1464
01:46:05,007 --> 01:46:06,101
Guys.

1465
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:09,226
What's happening?

1466
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:14,805
I can fly!

1467
01:46:19,587 --> 01:46:20,964
Guys.

1468
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:23,033
Check out these guns.

1469
01:46:23,987 --> 01:46:27,375
No. It's not possible.

1470
01:46:29,539 --> 01:46:32,200
Gee-whiz, mister. Sorry I took your cane.

1471
01:46:32,225 --> 01:46:33,578
Do you want it back?

1472
01:46:35,866 --> 01:46:37,781
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1473
01:46:37,973 --> 01:46:41,453
but I think we should kick
this guy's butt, like, really hard.

1474
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:54,467
Guys, I think I can move really...

1475
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,781
...fast.

1476
01:46:57,038 --> 01:46:59,040
Hyper-speed! Check!

1477
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:10,680
Billy! The eye!

1478
01:47:18,453 --> 01:47:19,609
Look out!

1479
01:47:21,774 --> 01:47:22,922
Whoa!

1480
01:47:24,277 --> 01:47:25,805
What?

1481
01:47:27,947 --> 01:47:28,902
- What!
- Dude!

1482
01:47:28,927 --> 01:47:30,929
You almost exploded me.

1483
01:48:16,913 --> 01:48:20,617
Dude, I've studied the fighting
techniques of every single superhero.

1484
01:48:21,668 --> 01:48:23,234
What do you got?

1485
01:48:26,696 --> 01:48:28,197
Well, that's terrifying.

1486
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,445
Enough games, boy.

1487
01:49:05,295 --> 01:49:06,945
You think a pack of children can...

1488
01:49:10,187 --> 01:49:11,259
Wait, what?

1489
01:49:11,284 --> 01:49:17,609
You will beg for mercy 
as I feast on your heart... slow.

1490
01:49:19,283 --> 01:49:22,870
Are you making some big evil guy speech
right now or something?

1491
01:49:22,895 --> 01:49:26,441
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

1492
01:49:26,466 --> 01:49:29,427
I will have the world
eating out of the palm of my hand...

1493
01:49:29,452 --> 01:49:32,088
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1494
01:49:32,113 --> 01:49:35,752
Only I have the power to unleash...

1495
01:49:37,448 --> 01:49:38,861
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

1496
01:50:09,776 --> 01:50:11,250
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

1497
01:50:19,061 --> 01:50:20,187
Hi!

1498
01:50:20,223 --> 01:50:21,600
Wow. I caught you.

1499
01:50:33,194 --> 01:50:35,976
I got it. I got it.

1500
01:50:41,995 --> 01:50:43,747
Oh, my God. I do got it.

1501
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:01,317
You're not gonna believe this,

1502
01:51:01,327 --> 01:51:03,319
but you're actually the first villain
I've ever fought.

1503
01:51:03,329 --> 01:51:04,956
It's kind of a huge deal for me.

1504
01:51:20,297 --> 01:51:22,203
Somebody help!

1505
01:51:37,187 --> 01:51:39,195
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

1506
01:51:39,949 --> 01:51:42,744
My name is Darla,
and I've been really good.

1507
01:51:42,999 --> 01:51:44,101
What?

1508
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:48,993
Oh, crap.

1509
01:51:50,601 --> 01:51:51,477
No, no, no.

1510
01:51:51,502 --> 01:51:52,503
No, no. No!

1511
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:12,106
No! No, no.

1512
01:52:20,323 --> 01:52:23,058
Oh, my God!
Is he giving us suitcase wedgies?

1513
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:02,487
So this is, like,
the Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1514
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:08,646
I mean, I've never been great at math, but,
uh, the big, angry one, that's Wrath, yeah?

1515
01:53:08,671 --> 01:53:10,901
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1516
01:53:11,725 --> 01:53:15,186
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

1517
01:53:15,211 --> 01:53:19,042
who I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1518
01:53:19,389 --> 01:53:22,475
But that's only six.
Where's lucky number seven?

1519
01:53:22,552 --> 01:53:24,762
Where's little man? Where's Envy?

1520
01:53:25,029 --> 01:53:27,698
Is he just scared of me and my family
because we're so awesome?

1521
01:53:27,723 --> 01:53:28,917
Because I get that.

1522
01:53:29,073 --> 01:53:31,536
Like, the other sins,
they get to come out and fight

1523
01:53:31,561 --> 01:53:33,437
because they're big
and strong and scary.

1524
01:53:33,462 --> 01:53:34,846
But Envy...

1525
01:53:35,849 --> 01:53:37,308
...he's just the runt.

1526
01:53:49,961 --> 01:53:53,182
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

1527
01:53:53,207 --> 01:53:55,001
Because they all know who'd win.

1528
01:53:55,918 --> 01:54:01,215
And it's not weak, worthless, ugly Envy.

1529
01:54:27,387 --> 01:54:28,588
Gotcha.

1530
01:54:29,354 --> 01:54:30,846
Shazam!

1531
01:54:37,444 --> 01:54:38,596
Shazam!

1532
01:54:49,388 --> 01:54:51,140
Ready to go round up your buddies?

1533
01:55:20,461 --> 01:55:23,438
No. No!

1534
01:55:53,267 --> 01:55:55,295
Here's the thing about power.

1535
01:55:55,997 --> 01:55:59,709
What good's power,
if you got nobody to share it with?

1536
01:56:01,249 --> 01:56:03,130
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

1537
01:56:03,155 --> 01:56:05,006
- That's disgusting.
- Fatality.

1538
01:56:06,882 --> 01:56:08,209
I got the voice.

1539
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:12,802
What's that?

1540
01:56:18,394 --> 01:56:20,563
I can have anything I've ever wanted?

1541
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,568
Billy.

1542
01:56:25,593 --> 01:56:26,919
No, no, no!

1543
01:56:26,944 --> 01:56:28,404
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

1544
01:56:28,429 --> 01:56:29,841
Billy, don't do it!

1545
01:56:30,489 --> 01:56:31,907
Ah!

1546
01:56:32,533 --> 01:56:34,702
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

1547
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:37,888
You think I'm gonna put a demon ball
in my head? That's disgusting.

1548
01:56:37,913 --> 01:56:40,291
That's funny. That's pretty funny.
You got me going.

1549
01:56:40,316 --> 01:56:41,990
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

1550
01:56:44,948 --> 01:56:46,075
What?

1551
01:56:47,772 --> 01:56:49,388
Oh. Hey.

1552
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,584
Oh, wow.

1553
01:56:59,977 --> 01:57:01,312
All right, We did it!

1554
01:57:01,337 --> 01:57:05,341
Hey, all right, yeah! We did it!

1555
01:57:06,429 --> 01:57:08,388
We did it!

1556
01:57:09,048 --> 01:57:12,214
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1557
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,575
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

1558
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,951
We're good.

1559
01:57:25,993 --> 01:57:27,661
You sure this is gonna work?

1560
01:57:29,437 --> 01:57:30,724
Told ya.

1561
01:57:31,092 --> 01:57:32,301
Whoa!

1562
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:35,201
Whoa!

1563
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,435
You guys know what this place is, right?

1564
01:57:51,771 --> 01:57:54,632
A dark, haunted cave with demon statues.

1565
01:57:54,657 --> 01:57:57,380
Well, yes, but also...

1566
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:03,265
Lair! We got a lair!

1567
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:04,533
- Lair.
- Yeah.

1568
01:58:04,558 --> 01:58:05,601
No, you right.

1569
01:58:05,626 --> 01:58:07,169
We got a lair.

1570
01:58:09,171 --> 01:58:10,568
What's a lair?

1571
01:58:11,287 --> 01:58:13,150
And thanks to six superheroes,

1572
01:58:13,175 --> 01:58:17,263
citizens are back in their homes,
safe again with their families.

1573
01:58:17,288 --> 01:58:19,505
And here with an eyewitness account
of the events-

1574
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:21,959
It was crazy, man!

1575
01:58:22,007 --> 01:58:24,107
Creatures from hell!

1576
01:58:24,132 --> 01:58:26,872
Lightning coming out
of everyone's everything!

1577
01:58:26,897 --> 01:58:29,708
And that is not cool, man!

1578
01:58:29,733 --> 01:58:31,836
So, first day as a superhero.

1579
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:34,459
Automatic top spot for best ever.

1580
01:58:34,983 --> 01:58:36,950
The man shattered the glass noodle ceiling.

1581
01:58:36,975 --> 01:58:38,726
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

1582
01:58:38,966 --> 01:58:39,967
Guys.

1583
01:58:40,694 --> 01:58:42,341
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

1584
01:58:45,029 --> 01:58:46,732
Wait, wait, wait.

1585
01:58:46,757 --> 01:58:47,800
Wait.

1586
01:58:48,007 --> 01:58:49,728
Thank you for this food.

1587
01:58:49,753 --> 01:58:51,797
Thank you for this day.

1588
01:58:51,822 --> 01:58:53,177
Thank you for this family.

1589
01:58:54,008 --> 01:58:56,404
I thought maybe this time I'd stay.

1590
01:58:57,441 --> 01:58:59,873
I mean, after all,

1591
01:59:00,177 --> 01:59:01,223
I'm home.

1592
01:59:33,339 --> 01:59:35,090
He better not sit at our table.

1593
01:59:38,544 --> 01:59:39,951
Nope!

1594
01:59:42,056 --> 01:59:43,240
Okay.

1595
01:59:46,353 --> 01:59:50,281
What are you doing? Waiting for
your imaginary BFF to show up?

1596
01:59:50,314 --> 01:59:51,482
Yeah.

1597
02:00:00,128 --> 02:00:01,542
What are you guys doing here?

1598
02:00:01,567 --> 02:00:03,135
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1599
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:05,034
But you guys have different lunch periods.

1600
02:00:05,038 --> 02:00:06,866
Well, we made a very special arrangement.

1601
02:00:08,413 --> 02:00:10,023
Darla, what's going on?

1602
02:00:10,047 --> 02:00:11,417
Why are you asking me?

1603
02:00:11,744 --> 02:00:13,073
Freddy Freeman.

1604
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:20,694
This guy taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1605
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:23,013
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

1606
02:00:23,038 --> 02:00:27,636
What's going on,
my best bud in the whole world?

1607
02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:32,289
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

1608
02:00:32,314 --> 02:00:33,274
Uh...

1609
02:00:33,299 --> 02:00:36,093
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

1610
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:37,124
Sun of Ra.

1611
02:03:38,375 --> 02:03:44,965
Ouroboros.

1612
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:52,664
Solomon's Knot.

1613
02:04:03,901 --> 02:04:07,404
No! No!

1614
02:04:13,714 --> 02:04:15,824
Primitive symbols.

1615
02:04:16,747 --> 02:04:21,628
You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.

1616
02:04:22,108 --> 02:04:26,195
You assume there's only one way
to gain magic.

1617
02:04:26,381 --> 02:04:28,378
No, no, no.

1618
02:04:29,363 --> 02:04:32,503
There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.

1619
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:35,307
What in God's name?

1620
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:39,813
I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.

1621
02:04:39,838 --> 02:04:43,049
Oh, what fun we're going to have together.

1622
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:47,269
The Seven Realms are about to be ours.

1623
02:11:13,622 --> 02:11:16,036
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1624
02:11:17,278 --> 02:11:18,560
Yeah, I'm sure.

1625
02:11:18,585 --> 02:11:21,168
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

1626
02:11:22,292 --> 02:11:24,482
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

1627
02:11:24,502 --> 02:11:27,346
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

1628
02:11:27,371 --> 02:11:31,515
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

1629
02:11:31,852 --> 02:11:35,022
Oh, yeah. Well, that's not that cool.
