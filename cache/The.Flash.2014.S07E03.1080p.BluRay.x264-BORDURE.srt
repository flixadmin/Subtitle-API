1
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,071
Cisco, what...

2
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:31,865
Frost. Frost...

3
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,008
Barry.

4
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,390
Barry.

5
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,644
Help her. Help her.

6
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,063
Iris.

7
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,147
Iris.

8
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,575
Help her.

9
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,992
Is she gonna be okay?

10
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,871
When you pulled Iris out of
the Mirrorverse and she resisted,

11
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,789
it created a molecular anomaly.

12
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,167
All her neural pathways
are disjointed.

13
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,294
Looks like her brain's been remapped.

14
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:07,754
How do we get her back?

15
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,382
I don't know.

16
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,219
All we can do now is let her rest
while I run some more tests.

17
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,643
You gonna be okay?

18
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,105
I remember everything...

19
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,150
Hurting my own team,

20
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,029
forcing Iris through the portal,
leaving Kamilla and Singh trapped.

21
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,199
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,534
That wasn't you.

23
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,120
- Yeah it was.
- Man, no, it wasn't.

24
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,539
You were not yourself.

25
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,291
Trust me, we get that.

26
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,378
That's why we're going
to put it behind us.

27
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,713
We're going to move on, all right?

28
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:51,839
We're a team.

29
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,383
We've got each other's backs.

30
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:57,470
We're gonna figure out a way
to save Iris and Kamilla and Singh.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,721
I promise.

32
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,807
Eva's still out there,
and I can't stop her

33
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,558
because I don't have
my speed anymore.

34
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,228
But you will.
I am running a full diagnostics

35
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,854
on the Artificial
Speed Force Machine.

36
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,439
It worked before. It can work again.

37
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,125
All we need to do is figure out.
I think...

38
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,110
No, I'm done with that thing.

39
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,611
You saw what it turned me into.

40
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,239
I'm not Thawne.

41
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,783
Connecting with something
artificial isn't gonna work for me.

42
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,204
And since the real Speed Force
is dead...

43
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,304
C.C.P.D.

44
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,046
Wait. Your wife tried to attack you?

45
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,816
Why would your neighbor
try to make you look in the mirrors?

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,299
Hold on. C.C.P.D.

47
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,093
If he's not your uncle, who is he?

48
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,302
Let me get this straight.

49
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,180
You want to help bring
your daughter in,

50
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,016
Mrs. Dearbon,
so that I can arrest her?

51
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,852
Sue's in trouble.

52
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,770
We want to help her
see things more clearly.

53
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,523
People change, sometimes overnight.

54
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,736
Captain, can I speak with you?

55
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:56,946
It's relevant.

56
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,490
Excuse me.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,544
Uh... Damn!

58
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,131
Sue, I thought you and Ralph
were laying low

59
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,549
until we can clear your name.

60
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,050
Yeah, Ralph's tracking a lead.

61
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,635
Arrest me if you have to.

62
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,719
I had to come.

63
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,972
You mind telling me
what's so important

64
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,390
that you would risk your freedom?

65
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,102
Those people in there,
those are not my parents.

66
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,479
I know it sounds crazy.

67
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,731
And when Ralph mentioned pod people
a while back,

68
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,734
I thought it was nuts, too.
But I'm telling you, that's not them.

69
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,735
No.

70
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,280
I believe you. I have gotten over
a hundred calls in the last hour.

71
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,866
Exact same complaint.

72
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,786
All saying that people
they've known for years

73
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,162
just aren't themselves anymore.

74
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,625
Do you think this has anything to do
with the craziness at McCulloch?

75
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,502
Damn.

76
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:53,961
I know what's happening.

77
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,255
Move.

78
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,554
What the hell.

79
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,082
<i>Chaos has broken out
in downtown Central City,</i>

80
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,066
<i>over another meta attack.</i>

81
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,195
After all that, at least Grandma Runk
is still my grandma, you know,

82
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,906
'cause I was at Jitters
ordering a Viva! ccino!

83
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,533
Next thing I know,
a pair of "T2" arms

84
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,618
jumps out of a counter top
trying to grab me.

85
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,412
Fortunately, Chester P. Runk
knows how to mind his surroundings.

86
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,496
Yo!

87
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,124
I just heard back from Joe.

88
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,088
Whatever is happening out there,
it's spreading.

89
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,479
Yeah, Eva's getting more powerful.

90
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,047
I'll say. I analyzed footage
from Eva's live interview.

91
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,424
It's not just mirrors
that she's manipulating.

92
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,386
It's any reflective surface now.

93
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,197
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

94
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,698
Light photons
are elementary particles

95
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,266
that exist everywhere in nature.

96
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,434
So as long as there's light around

97
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:54,146
from either a natural
or artificial source...

98
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,148
Call Joe back,
we got to blackout the city.

99
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,312
He can get the mayor
to declare a state of emergency.

100
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,402
Okay, I am on it.

101
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,737
Why is Eva doing this?

102
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,757
I mean why does she want us
in the Mirrorverse?

103
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,221
She wants us out of the way.

104
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,701
These aren't just abductions.

105
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,745
It's a full-blown invasion.

106
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:14,417
And with every person
that gets replaced, Eva's army grows.

107
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,085
Oh, man.

108
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,712
Body snatchers.

109
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,382
So, what are we gonna do?

110
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,561
Boss, you have to get better.

111
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,856
<i>The Citizen</i> doesn't work
without you.

112
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,903
So just please come back, okay?

113
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,574
Because we're not giving up on you,
especially Barry.

114
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:55,374
What you two have is amazing.
No matter how strong

115
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,794
you both are on your own,
you're even stronger together.

116
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,673
Don't let Eva McCulloch end
what you guys have.

117
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,511
The mayor is doing her best
shutting down the power.

118
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,138
Joe said it won't be 100 percent,

119
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,307
but I told him we'd take
whatever we can get.

120
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:16,604
In the meantime, initiating shutters
on all windows in S.T.A.R. Labs.

121
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,859
We should cover all the mirrors, too,
and kill the lights.

122
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:22,859
Yes, I'm on it.

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,446
Hopefully everybody in Central City
does the same thing.

124
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,951
If I had my speed, I could patrol,
help people keep safe.

125
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,873
There's got to be a way to save
them all, to get Iris back.

126
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,249
<i>There is...</i>

127
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,093
Hey, were you saying something?

128
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,765
Uh, guys? Where's Barry?

129
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:13,661
You're powerless, Flash,
but I can help you.

130
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,289
If you let me.

131
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
You want to help?

132
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,627
Tell me how to save my wife.

133
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,171
She needs to go back
where she belongs.

134
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,674
All of you do.

135
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,427
Back to the Mirrorverse.

136
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,262
You see, in the last six years,

137
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:36,726
I've watched people like Joseph
destroy the gift around you.

138
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,896
The glorious world
filled with wonder.

139
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,276
You and everyone else on this planet
have failed.

140
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,447
So now I'm filling it
with my children.

141
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,786
And you will treat it,
and everyone in it, with respect.

142
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,081
- And what happens to us?
- You adapt to your new world.

143
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,999
Same as I did.

144
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,211
Don't worry, Barry.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

145
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,421
I'm not your enemy.

146
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,054
What I am is a mother
to a newer, better world.

147
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,305
You want me to give in.

148
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,306
Just like Ramsey.

149
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,225
Ramsey thought he was a hero.

150
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,352
He wasn't.

151
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,730
You are.

152
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,442
Lead your people to the Mirrorverse.

153
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,693
They'll follow you.

154
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,862
- They'll be happy.
- Were you?

155
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,822
Stop fighting me!

156
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,365
You've been watching me, Eva.

157
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,453
You know I'd risk my life
to save this city.

158
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,706
Those are brave words, Flash.

159
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,919
But are you really willing to do
whatever it takes

160
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,089
to ensure the survival of humanity?

161
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,886
The applications of my reflective
chip technology are endless.

162
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,389
I can grow crops tenfolds
in abundance.

163
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,643
I can end starvation overnight.

164
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,020
Why haven't you?

165
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:09,485
Why haven't you done the work
that really matters?

166
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:15,324
Why haven't you made
this world a better place?

167
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,912
Because you can't.

168
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,501
I can. And I will.

169
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,129
I'm not human.

170
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,715
I'm something better.

171
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,846
That is why I am showing you mercy.

172
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:41,725
So please consider my offer

173
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,398
and make the right choice.

174
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,196
Satellites have him at McCulloch.

175
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,198
Barry, I am not losing you, too.

176
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,701
Frost is ready to come out.

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh, thank Tupac.

178
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,584
How did you escape?

179
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,794
I didn't. Eva let me go.

180
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,630
- Why? What did she want?
- To tell us that we can't win.

181
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,507
Well, I hope you told her
where to go.

182
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,844
No, she's right. We can't.

183
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,835
Nash.

184
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,003
No.

185
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,714
My name is Harrison.

186
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,259
Dr. Harrison Wells.

187
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,312
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I saw Nash die.

188
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,397
All the other Wells died with him.

189
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,481
Exactly.

190
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:16,154
When Nash Wells gave his life
to power the artificial Speed Force,

191
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:21,242
he transferred all the multi-versal
particles of all the other Wells

192
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,536
into the Fusion Sphere,
except for 0.01 percent.

193
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,707
- And that's me.
- How do particles become a person?

194
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,294
I have a theory that when Nash
and all the other Wells

195
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,796
were removed from the timeline,

196
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,217
the universe required a...
balancing act.

197
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,221
One Wells to make up
for all of those lost.

198
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,431
Isn't that cosmic?

199
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,601
Crisis.

200
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,728
There was an event.

201
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:53,065
It took people from other planets
and brought them here together.

202
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,192
To the same planet in one timeline.

203
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:59,530
A temporal coalescence.
That could explain this.

204
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:10,291
Of all the Wells, you were
the one I wanted to meet the most.

205
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,336
- I'm...
- Barry Allen.

206
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,380
I know.

207
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,593
The other Wells may be gone
but they left an imprint. Memories.

208
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,347
And so let me just say
whatever is wrong,

209
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,562
let me help you
because they would want me to.

210
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:37,067
You can't. This enemy
that we're facing is all powerful.

211
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,988
Plus, my speed is gone.

212
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,489
Aren't you the Paragon of Love?

213
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,785
Look, anyone can save the world
with their speed, with their might,

214
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,791
but it takes a real hero,
a once-in-a-lifetime hero,

215
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,586
to do it with his heart.

216
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,339
What is that supposed to mean?

217
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:04,511
It means run, Barry, run toward love.

218
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,819
Nash?

219
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,154
No.

220
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,496
Allegra, Nash thought...

221
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,457
very highly of you.

222
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,591
A new Wells?

223
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,180
How's that possible?

224
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,892
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
you're here to save us, right?

225
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,728
Also, which one is he?

226
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,688
I'm the original.

227
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,198
Okay.

228
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,159
I had Allegra put out a <i>Citizen</i>
e-blast to warn the city about Eva.

229
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,328
- Good work.
- Thanks.

230
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,749
What is it?

231
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,084
That window was blacked out.

232
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,545
Where is everyone?

233
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:27,761
I'm feeling
an overwhelming sense of passion.

234
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,179
Confidence.

235
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Focus.

236
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,057
Joe, I...

237
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,397
You may as well give up, Captain.

238
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,151
- Joe?
- Captain West requesting backup.

239
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,735
No one's coming, Captain.

240
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:44,903
Cecile, run!

241
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,204
- The windows...
- Um... Uh...

242
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,999
My phone's not working.

243
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,584
She must've jammed the signal.

244
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,504
Unfortunate.

245
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,467
Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells,
Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells and Wells.

246
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,093
That's how I got here. Any questions?

247
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,013
- Uh, I don't get how...
- What!

248
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,389
Help! Guys...

249
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,515
we need help.

250
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:15,933
Sue?

251
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,477
Ralph?

252
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,314
Holy Plasmus!

253
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,025
Dibs, where's your face?
It looks like mashed potatoes.

254
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,443
Don't! Don't touch him.

255
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,904
His body temp
is a toasty 500 degrees.

256
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,865
Wait, you mean something actually
melted Elongated Man?

257
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,700
Holy sweet Hawking...

258
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,203
Ralph texted me to meet him
at McCulloch Labs.

259
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,580
He was looking for evidence
to clear your name, wasn't he?

260
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,209
Yeah. He figured security would
be down because of the blackout.

261
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,294
He was inside
when Eva blew the whole place up.

262
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,879
I got caught in the blast radius.

263
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,089
He walked out holding this.

264
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,676
Can you fix him?

265
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,346
Right, I'll get him in the mobile
Biogenic Containment Unit.

266
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,324
Okay, we're going this way.
Right this way, Ralph.

267
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,228
Come with me, Sue.
I'll take a look at your arm.

268
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,562
It's lookin' a little toasty.

269
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,605
Okay...

270
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,443
Anything?

271
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,320
I mean, not really...

272
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,113
Wait...

273
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,574
Yeah, Ralph found
evidence to clear Sue's name.

274
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,161
Once a hero, always a hero.

275
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,495
Amen.

276
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,086
I know you're still
in there somewhere.

277
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,755
I'll never stop fighting
to reach you.

278
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,720
I may be the Paragon of Love, but...

279
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,808
that's only because you're my heart.

280
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,272
Please!

281
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,483
Come back to me.

282
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,587
I don't get it.

283
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,256
How are you supposed
to get your speed back exactly?

284
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,381
Iris...

285
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,674
Iris is the key.

286
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,303
Yeah. Still not following.

287
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,469
The Speed Force...

288
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,180
We all thought it was dead, right?

289
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,851
I just felt a spark, with Iris.
Just now.

290
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,769
Barry, your speed is gone.

291
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,231
Yeah, but the Speed Force
is an elemental part of the universe.

292
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,317
So, theoretically...

293
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,446
Theoretically, it could've
never disappeared.

294
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,448
And you think it's still in Iris.

295
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,450
I always wondered why I was chosen

296
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,119
as the Paragon of Love
and how it related to my speed.

297
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,413
I think it's because
of my connection with Iris.

298
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,206
Our love is...

299
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,293
It's just as strong as the lightning
bolt that hit me seven years ago.

300
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,670
Plus, Iris did have speed once.

301
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,674
And Nora was a speedster whose
lightning was purple and yellow.

302
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,426
That is so romantic.

303
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,388
If Speed Force energy is still
in Iris, how do we get it out of her?

304
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,015
Well...

305
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,560
We repurpose the ASF
to tap into an organic source

306
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,746
instead of an artificial one.

307
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,896
I can help with that.

308
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,416
- I'm gonna need...
- I got it.

309
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,608
If this works,

310
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,611
we can all take the fight
to Eva together.

311
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,754
Bring them a new life, my children.

312
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,426
Go, go, go!

313
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,600
Knock knock.

314
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,606
It's too late, Captain.

315
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,692
This is Mother's world now.

316
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,733
Can she get through?

317
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,320
Yes. That door wasn't designed
for tactical force.

318
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,741
Well, it should've been.

319
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,661
These old buildings
still have the original ductwork.

320
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,790
Human beings took
this world for granted, Captain.

321
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,292
We won't.

322
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,130
I don't wanna leave you.

323
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,673
Please, Joe, come on.

324
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,341
Kiss Jenna for me.

325
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,677
Now go!

326
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,057
Okay, she's breathing.

327
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,393
What's the ETA
on the energy coupling reroute?

328
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,186
Energy cycles rerouted.

329
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,914
The Fusion Sphere
is completely re-mapped.

330
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,649
I have to say, is this how
you guys operate?

331
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:36,194
Because that much contact
with that much unrefined power...

332
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,321
This is a huge gamble.

333
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,240
Mr. Allen, if you're
wrong about Iris,

334
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,576
every atom in your body
will be split in two.

335
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,494
Barry...

336
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,976
We need you.

337
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,771
We need you.

338
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,648
I'll be okay.

339
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,826
Energy's climbing.

340
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,008
<i>Run, Barry. Run!</i>

341
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,677
<i>Run towards love.</i>

342
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,899
Yup. Ain't no "A" in this SF.

343
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,542
Incredible...

344
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,254
We're at 100 percent organic speed.

345
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
We need you...

346
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,339
I need you...

347
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,182
I knew you'd find your way
back to me.

348
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,234
You'll always be my lightning rod.

349
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,706
Don't be afraid.

350
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,959
You're going someplace better.

351
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,586
I promise.

352
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,254
Take them.

353
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,923
No!

354
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,762
No!

355
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,430
Flash!

356
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,350
You've made your choice.

357
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,311
Now face the consequences.

358
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,065
It's over, Eva.

359
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,236
Why doesn't Flash use his speed?

360
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,530
Eva's body is made up
of quantum protons,

361
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,867
which are capable of sub-light speed,
so technically...

362
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,369
She's...

363
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,371
faster.

364
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,327
You're not Cecile.

365
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,204
Nope.

366
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,249
But, she's close.

367
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,003
And if you want to be with her,

368
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,214
there's only one way.

369
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,804
Why should I trust you?

370
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,734
You have no choice.

371
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:35,492
Hm.

372
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,540
You and I could have worked together
toward a common good.

373
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,333
It's too late now.

374
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,586
Humankind is done.

375
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,840
My children are taking over the world
and I'm their Queen Mother.

376
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,301
And tonight I begin my reign

377
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,304
as Mirror Monarch.

378
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,432
Actually, we're just getting started.

379
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,311
How do you like the sonics, my lady?

380
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,606
But wait, there's more.

381
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,362
Now, Flash.

382
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,918
<i>Small town baby
Got his knickers in a twist</i>

383
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,368
<i>Doesn't like the way
That this car suits my lips</i>

384
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,495
<i>What you think...</i>

385
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,331
Not fair. You brought your team.

386
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,624
<i>...trying to be your best you</i>

387
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,958
<i>Suited and booted...</i>

388
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,168
Maybe I should bring mine.

389
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,004
<i>Trying to act a grownup
Now that's pretty funny</i>

390
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,590
<i>I fired everyone
Now I be making plenty</i>

391
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,593
<i>I'm feeling pretty empty
This attitude's expensive</i>

392
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,137
<i>Take a trip and you might find</i>

393
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:41,309
<i>Let's make this public
Let's take it outside</i>

394
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,230
<i>Put down your small-talk
And teach me to fight</i>

395
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,191
Sounds like Iron Heights
on Saturday night out there.

396
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,989
<i>Caught in the middle
Karma can raise your face</i>

397
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,617
<i>Trying too hard
Yeah, it's gonna make you age</i>

398
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,286
<i>Walk into the room
Everybody looks the same</i>

399
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,289
<i>I'm so tired of this place, yeah
Why you scared of change, yeah?</i>

400
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,875
<i>Too many photos
And not enough friends</i>

401
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,419
<i>Waiting on the next fad
And the next trend</i>

402
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,297
<i>Poses in the hall
And they clogging up the stairways</i>

403
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,259
<i>Come on, baby, let's play</i>

404
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,680
<i>Let's make this public
Let's take it outside</i>

405
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:23,226
<i>Put down your small-talk
And teach me to fight</i>

406
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,643
Cover me!

407
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,313
<i>Let's make this personal...</i>

408
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,816
I can't fix these things in time.

409
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,192
You better figure something out.

410
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,819
And fast.

411
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,280
Let's do this.

412
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,535
<i>It's all I seem to see
And it's all you seem to know</i>

413
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,453
<i>'Cause you're itching to find out</i>

414
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,537
Frost!

415
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,748
<i>But my body's gonna go</i>

416
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:51,004
<i>See you turn up at my door
'Cause you don't know anywhere</i>

417
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:56,676
<i>The bodies on the lam
'Cause you'll see us on the road</i>

418
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,887
Every big bad has a weakness.

419
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,263
What did we miss?

420
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,809
The fact that Barry needs
more than speed to win this fight.

421
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,253
Finish him.

422
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,006
Flash!

423
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,052
- No, Eva! Please don't.
- It's too late.

424
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,512
Flash has had his chance.

425
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,596
And so do you.

426
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,141
Eva, you're destroying this world.

427
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:48,686
No, I'm liberating it
from an infestation.

428
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,774
My children deserve this planet
more than humankind does.

429
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,110
I'll deal with him, join the others.

430
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:00,906
Eva!

431
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,993
You just can't give up, can you?

432
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,703
Fine, goodbye!

433
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:32,981
That's impossible.

434
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,944
You're still not strong enough
to beat me.

435
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,279
Not yet.

436
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:42,573
Eva, you told my husband that you
wanted to bring peace to this world.

437
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:47,036
You're using brutal force
against defenseless people.

438
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,789
Eva, my duplicate...

439
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,042
She was connected to this world.

440
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,128
With herself.

441
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,463
But your other children?

442
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,091
They are filled with hate.

443
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,760
Look around.

444
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,054
Is this your idea of peace?

445
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,562
No, no!

446
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,372
Is this really what you want?

447
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:38,897
- Get back. Now's our chance...
- Don't!

448
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,214
Please, just wait.

449
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,390
No.

450
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,064
No, I...

451
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,942
I wanted to make things better.

452
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,159
I've failed two worlds.

453
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,954
Eva, it's never too late
to do the right thing.

454
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,582
You told me about your dream
to help people.

455
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,584
You still can.

456
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,503
Right here, right now.

457
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,338
By ending this.

458
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:25,051
The foundation for a better world
is compassion, not violence.

459
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,845
A true monarch knows that.

460
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,046
It's not working.

461
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,309
They've grown too strong
for me to control.

462
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,857
We did it.

463
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,490
What about the people we lost?

464
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,012
Chief Singh?

465
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,223
Sir, what happened?

466
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,767
- Are we...
- Dead?

467
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,187
No, officer. We're very much alive.

468
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,650
I'm pretty sure we owe our lives
to a certain speedster.

469
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,194
And his better half.

470
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,032
Joe.

471
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,507
Is it really you?

472
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,677
No, it's Chewbacca.

473
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,388
It's Kamilla. The real one.

474
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,764
If she's back, then...

475
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,850
That means the rest
of Central City is, too.

476
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,852
Where are you?

477
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,645
I'm back at <i>The Citizen.</i>

478
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,981
I was in that other place.

479
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,774
I never thought I'd get out.

480
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,192
Don't go anywhere.

481
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,653
Imma kiss you like there's
no tomorrow.

482
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,823
I love you, Kamilla.

483
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,451
I love you, too.

484
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,456
Need a ride? I'm ice bridging.

485
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,790
Safest way to travel.

486
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,751
Knowing you,
I find that hard to believe.

487
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,088
So, what will you do now?

488
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,765
Go back to the Mirrorverse...

489
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,934
Do what I should've done
a long time ago.

490
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,187
Start over.

491
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,529
This time, my children
will be born of love,

492
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,239
not hate.

493
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,992
Free to choose their own path.

494
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,751
Good luck.

495
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
Any sign of Eva?

496
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,695
Nope. Looks like Mirror Monarch
was serious about starting over.

497
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,572
Iris, what you did out there...

498
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,534
What if you're a meta now?

499
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:45,538
I'm pretty sure Eva took my mirror
powers back with her when she left.

500
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,974
Maybe when she went back to
the Mirrorverse it severed the link.

501
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,250
Without it, no powers.

502
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,461
Well, the pod people are gone,
and we got everyone else back.

503
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,380
Singh, Dearbons, Kamilla.

504
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,425
It's a good day's work,
people.

505
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,468
Oh wait, where's O.G. Wells?

506
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,928
With Cisco and Allegra.

507
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,513
They wanted to say
their own goodbyes.

508
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:03,806
Ah.

509
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,060
Are you sure you have to go?

510
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,479
I heard Team Flash
always has a Wells.

511
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,231
Well, that's overrated.

512
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,316
Plus, Flash has his speed back,

513
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,235
Mirror Monarch is back
where she belongs.

514
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,030
- It's time.
- But, I need someone to train me.

515
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,490
Allegra, you have your own...

516
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,161
wavelength to follow,
and as it turns out,

517
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,454
somehow I have mine.

518
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,581
The universe gave me my life back,

519
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,667
somehow, and now I can see

520
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:36,213
all 92 years of that life.
Past, present and future...

521
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,757
simultaneously.

522
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,967
And somehow, can travel

523
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,219
to any moment I want.

524
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,888
Timeless Wells...

525
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:45,973
That's a new one.

526
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,642
It's amazing and utterly useless,

527
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,686
unless I can share it
with the woman that I love.

528
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,938
My wife, Tess...

529
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,568
We had four brilliant years together,
before she...

530
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,573
before we both were killed.

531
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,868
And so, I now have a choice between

532
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,954
moving forward
from this point without her...

533
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,708
or going back to her.

534
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:19,173
I'm going to relive those four years
we had together

535
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:24,136
over, and over, and over again,
until I'm out of time.

536
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,681
Good luck.

537
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,601
Allegra...

538
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,604
good luck to you.

539
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,319
I get that...

540
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,947
Wanting to be with
the person you love.

541
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,072
Hm.

542
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:47,243
If Kamilla and I are lucky enough to
share half of what you and Tess have.

543
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,369
You will.

544
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,709
- This is weird.
- No, we just met.

545
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,545
Right, it's like
I barely even know you.

546
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,671
Barely know each other.

547
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,757
I mean, you're nothing like him.

548
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:02,967
Like who? Oh.

549
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,553
The Harrison Wells you used to know.

550
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,138
Or, the man I thought
was Harrison Wells.

551
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:10,808
Of course, he turned out to be a...

552
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,518
- A jerk.
- Jerk!

553
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:15,688
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

554
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,151
How do you miss someone
you barely even know?

555
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,752
Before you go,

556
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,673
how exactly do you travel in time?

557
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:45,593
Easy.

558
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,136
Just...

559
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,514
like this.

560
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,862
Just like that.

561
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,759
<i>Well, we spoke to Captain West.</i>

562
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,035
<i>Actually, I did.</i>

563
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,679
Ralph's voice
would've freaked him out.

564
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,556
What's not to love about my silky tones?

565
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,498
Dude, you sound like a Dalek.

566
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,702
Yeah, I feel like
the helmet's more Daft Punk.

567
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,462
What? You know I love to lose myself

568
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:22,981
- to dance every once in a while.
- Baby, do not do that.

569
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,006
- You love it.
- Do not.

570
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,969
Don't worry, Ralph. A few more days
in the B.C.U., you'll be good as new.

571
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:30,137
Either way, it's good
to have you back, Caity. Frost, too.

572
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,555
So, now that my parents are okay

573
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,849
and C.C.P.D. has evidence
to clear me,

574
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,059
thanks to Ralph...

575
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,019
We should celebrate.

576
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,813
Sue, did you ever think
about joining Team Flash?

577
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,649
We could use somebody
with your skills.

578
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,944
Me, teaming up with Dr. Perfect

579
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:45,985
and a squeaky-clean do-gooder

580
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,780
like Fleet-Feet here?

581
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:48,989
Not my style.

582
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,992
Besides, Ralph and I have
some unfinished business.

583
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:54,429
Black Hole is dead, but there's
an organization just like them

584
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,996
in every country in the world,

585
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:58,040
preying on good people
like my parents.

586
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,517
And we're going to
pay them a visit...

587
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,626
And clean house.

588
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,754
Ralph, we've been through a lot
since you joined this team.

589
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,798
Save it, Barr.
This ain't goodbye.

590
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,359
I'll be back
when you least expect it.

591
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,177
And then Frost,
we'll go on that road trip, okay?

592
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,553
She says, "Hell, yeah!"

593
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,430
Well, if you ever need help,
just call.

594
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,514
I'll come running.

595
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:15,724
Thanks.

596
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,184
You do the same.

597
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,854
- Come on, Slick.
- Stay flashing. Dibny out.

598
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,648
They make quite the team.

599
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,154
So do we.
