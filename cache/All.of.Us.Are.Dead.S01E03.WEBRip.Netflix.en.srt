1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,434
A virus?

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,315
So what you're saying is

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,569
this entire mess was caused
by a virus you created?

4
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,034
Fine. A virus.

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,077
Why? Why did you create the virus?

6
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,455
Detective.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,251
Do you have any children?

8
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,052
Mommy.

9
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,136
Yes, sweetheart.

10
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,891
God, you're soaked in sweat.

11
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,101
Yun-a.

12
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,144
Oh no. Be careful.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,649
You should watch where you're going.

14
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,067
Good girl.

15
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,569
Could you let your child just die?

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,116
No parent in the world could do that.

17
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,202
Enough of your bullshit.
Just answer my question.

18
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,247
What kind of virus is it and--

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,998
Jae-ik. Emergency.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,626
Chief wants everyone to come. Hurry.

21
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,378
It's too late.

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,674
Everyone will die.

23
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,218
Don't bother having hope.

24
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,410
Oh fuck.

25
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,655
Cheong-san!

26
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,282
Look down. Down.

27
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,618
I know.

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,953
She's holding on, moron.
What are you doing?

29
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
-I know that.
-Drop her. Drop her now.

30
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm trying.

31
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,004
What are you doing, you moron?

32
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,969
Hey!

33
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,349
Hey. I'll come to you.

34
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,476
No, don't come.

35
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,229
Don't. Don't come.

36
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,189
-I'm coming.
-Don't!

37
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,484
I said, don't!

38
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,949
Wait.

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,826
Bare-su, above you!

40
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,222
Hey. My back.

41
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,641
Stay still. I'll help you.

42
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,144
What are you doing?

43
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,689
Wait, will you? Moron.

44
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,197
-It's Bare-su. Bare-su!
-Cheong-san!

45
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,037
It's Bare-su. Bare-su!

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,372
Are you okay?

47
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,959
Shit. I told you to drop her.

48
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,461
Why couldn't you do it?

49
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,298
Hey. Stop hugging me.
You're grossing me out.

50
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,050
I'm not hugging you, moron.

51
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,929
Get lost.

52
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,265
Do you like this?

53
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,979
-Are you okay, Bare-su?
-Close it.

54
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,523
Close it already!

55
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,484
Close the window! Please!

56
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,946
Didn't you see Cheong-san coming in?
We can't close it until he gets in.

57
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,656
Is it wrong to say to close it?

58
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,783
Is your own survival all that matters?

59
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,328
I can't stand you, stupid welfie.

60
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,961
-Hey. What the fuck did you say?
-Stop it.

61
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,171
What is it?

62
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,006
-Did you just hit me?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,632
Say that again.

64
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,926
Cut it out. What are you doing?

65
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,303
He just hit me.

66
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,096
You called me a welfie first.

67
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,097
Was I wrong?

68
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
How could you say that?

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,726
What's a welfie?

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,478
Tell me.

71
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,188
What is it?

72
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,150
What's a welfie?

73
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,821
A person on welfare.

74
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,116
-What?
-A person on welfare.

75
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,786
"Welfie" for short.

76
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,460
Na-yeon, you were wrong.
Don't you ever say that again.

77
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,753
And, Gyeong-su,

78
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,214
if you hit someone for saying that,
you're the one who loses.

79
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,174
-You understand what I mean, right?
-No.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,344
Kids, we shouldn't be fighting
among ourselves right now.

81
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,970
We don't know what's going on--

82
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
Aren't they zombies?

83
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,059
Where are the other teachers?
Did you call the cops?

84
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,103
I'm sure someone did.

85
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,479
I don't have my phone.

86
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,983
We called, too, but they're not coming.
Both the police and the first responders.

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,736
They'll be here soon.
Let's wait here a little longer.

88
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,115
Ms. Park. Hyeon-ju's hands were cold too.

89
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,033
So were I-sak's.

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,411
What if it started with Hyeon-ju?

91
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,246
She went to the hospital.

92
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,790
Then maybe it spread there too.

93
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,875
Maybe that's why no one's coming.

94
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,045
Hold on. This works, right?

95
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,798
Hey, the Internet.

96
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,133
-Excuse me, Ms. Park.
-Okay.

97
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,884
-Here. Sit.
-Thanks.

98
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,888
-Please, work. I assume so.
-Will it work? Is it on?

99
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,516
Why is it not turning on?

100
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,059
-It just came on.
-I see. Sorry.

101
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,062
It's for work, so it's slow.

102
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,524
Maybe it has no connection.

103
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,817
No, I'm sure it does.

104
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,903
-Do we have to wait all day?
-Is it still loading?

105
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,656
-I don't think it'll work.
-What?

106
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,366
In the science lab.

107
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,121
WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM

108
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,248
I came from the art room.

109
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,042
What's in the science lab?

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,587
Oh, well…

111
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,130
It worked.

112
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,341
-Open the browser.
-The browser.

113
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,220
Type in "zombie virus."

114
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,847
Type in "zombie" first.

115
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,764
-No, just…
-No.

116
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,641
-Type in "Hyosan."
-See what's trending.

117
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,018
-No.
-Damn it.

118
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,769
-Check the news.
-Search "emergency."

119
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,229
-The news.
-There won't be anything.

120
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,356
-Search "emergency."
-What do we type in?

121
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,069
Thanks. I'll see you next time.

122
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,213
-Oh my goodness. Are you all right?
-Are you okay? Get up.

123
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,380
Stand up.

124
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,967
-Call an ambulance.
-All right. Come this way.

125
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,929
-What's going on?
-Are you all right?

126
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,639
Are you okay?

127
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,600
He's badly injured. Call an ambulance.

128
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,976
Someone is in the back.

129
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,144
Come out.

130
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,066
What's the matter with you?

131
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,737
-What's wrong with you?
-Should we take them to the hospital?

132
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,160
Oh my God.

133
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,921
Stay away!

134
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,362
I'll check Facebook.

135
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,992
-I'm on Instagram.
-How many followers do you have?

136
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,119
Check Facebook.

137
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,502
How many friends do you have?

138
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
You have so many alerts. You have 1,700!

139
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,090
That's strange.

140
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,885
I'll check the messages first.

141
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,930
Fuck! What the…

142
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,391
-What the hell?
-Fuck.

143
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,810
What the hell?

144
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,769
What was that?

145
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,771
Get over here. Step back.

146
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,649
Did someone not make it in?

147
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,110
No. We're all here.

148
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,739
Don't go!

149
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,698
Cheong-san.

150
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,575
Be careful.

151
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,458
Do you see something?

152
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:27,877
What is it?

153
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,840
It must be the wind.

154
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,800
That scared me.

155
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,141
It's coming in!

156
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,144
Cheong-san, come back here.

157
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,356
Hey, watch out.

158
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,566
Cheong-san!

159
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,569
Bring Cheong-san back here!

160
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,029
Hey, wait!

161
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,241
-Push it! Push it away!
-Did you get it?

162
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,451
Push it!

163
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,166
Push it!

164
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,918
Push it more!

165
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,922
The hand!

166
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,633
-Push!
-Hey, watch out!

167
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,968
Step back!

168
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,137
Step back!

169
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,776
Don't go near it!

170
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,570
-Should I go or should you?
-Move over.

171
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,697
Hold on. I can't.

172
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,948
-Go, Dae-su.
-Should I go?

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,828
What are you doing?

174
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,557
-We're fucked.
-Just push it!

175
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,767
Just push it! Push it away!

176
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,145
Push it away already!

177
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,440
-Fuck. It's coming in.
-Su-hyeok! Just throw that away!

178
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,318
-Su-hyeok! Move away!
-Move, Bare-su!

179
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,626
Scared me.

180
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,587
I'm exhausted.

181
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,089
Are you okay?

182
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,007
I'm good.

183
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,552
Where did it come from?

184
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,181
-Everyone okay?
-That was scary.

185
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,223
I'm okay.

186
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,850
Good thinking.

187
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
Hey.

188
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,647
You…

189
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,737
RESCUE

190
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,698
HYOSAN CITY COUNCIL

191
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,870
He's our youngest aide.

192
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,581
He collapsed and started convulsing
when he returned

193
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,707
from the council office…

194
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,625
Captain.

195
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,044
He smells like a rotting corpse.

196
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,505
And then he got up,

197
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,132
growled, and charged
at Assembly Member Park.

198
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,218
So we tied him up.

199
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,553
We didn't know
if we should call the police. Yes?

200
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,013
Why are you telling them that?

201
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,307
He'll bite his tongue.

202
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,684
-Let's gag him and move him.
-Okay.

203
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,899
-Ready?
-Yes.

204
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,401
One, two, three.

205
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,740
-Did you get bit?
-It's okay. It's a small bite.

206
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,283
Wrap him up!

207
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,785
Wrap him.

208
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,125
Urgent message from headquarters.

209
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,712
Rescue Team One.

210
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,049
As of now,
issuing level-three disaster in Hyosan.

211
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,176
Everyone report to temporary headquarters.

212
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,928
Did you say level-three disaster?

213
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,805
I repeat.

214
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:12,309
Issuing level-three disaster in Hyosan.
Everyone report to temporary headquarters.

215
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
What is it?

216
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,855
-This is the director's order.
-Report where?

217
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,690
-Mobilize immediately. Over.
-Well…

218
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,569
Our headquarters was relocated
outside the city due to an emergency.

219
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,364
The Disaster and Safety Management
will control the situation directly.

220
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,825
Is an evacuation order really necessary?

221
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,535
All right.

222
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,578
Hang on.

223
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,082
They think it's an acute infection.

224
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,960
They expect an evacuation order
of Hyosan soon.

225
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,548
Gyeong-su, your nose is bleeding.

226
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,717
It is?

227
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,848
This is because Su-hyeok hit me
with the mop.

228
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,641
Stand back. Don't come closer.

229
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,643
You were bit, weren't you?

230
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,270
No, I wasn't.

231
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,855
Su-hyeok hit me…

232
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,902
Why do you keep picking on me?

233
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,486
You were bit!

234
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,198
I-sak got a nosebleed
just before she turned.

235
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,784
On-jo. You know.

236
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,120
That's how I-sak was before she turned.

237
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,082
-Gyeong-su.
-I really wasn't bit! I swear!

238
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,170
Damn it.

239
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,130
Hey.

240
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,965
Your hand. What is that?

241
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,467
What is that?

242
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,180
This was from
when I picked up the computer!

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,768
Don't you trust me?

244
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,897
This happened while I was saving you.
How could you do this?

245
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,364
It's not a bite. It's a scratch.

246
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,200
Whoever wants to check, come and check.

247
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,411
It's a scratch?

248
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,831
It is a scratch. I'm sure of it.

249
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,084
-Ms. Park, please take a look.
-Okay.

250
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,797
I don't see a bite.
It's a scratch. Thank goodness.

251
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,881
He's okay.

252
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,553
Satisfied?

253
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,556
I asked if you were satisfied!

254
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,560
But the computer's gone.

255
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,145
Then the Internet…

256
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,315
Did you have to throw that of all things?

257
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,859
What could I do? It was trying to get in.

258
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,571
I'm saying you did good.
Thank you. Don't get mad.

259
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,532
Hey, Na-yeon.

260
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,660
Say you're sorry and end this.

261
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,328
Why should I?

262
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,205
He did it to save us.

263
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,873
Just say you're sorry.

264
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,667
Why should I be sorry?

265
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,502
I saw everything.

266
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,254
I saw it grab your hand.

267
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm right.

268
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,844
He may have been infected.

269
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,387
Na-yeon, that's enough.

270
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,055
It really touched him.

271
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,642
Does being touched mean he's infected?

272
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,185
Who knows? It might.

273
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,396
I held I-sak's hand before she fell.

274
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,148
Why am I okay?

275
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,025
He has a wound on his hand.

276
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,485
It's different when it's an open wound.

277
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,987
-Why, that--
-Hey.

278
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,614
Don't yell at me. Think about it!

279
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,242
Na-yeon.

280
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,661
I know you've always hated Gyeong-su,

281
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,539
but this is completely different
from badmouthing him.

282
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,374
This is about life and death.

283
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,168
She's always like this.

284
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,088
If it weren't for him, we may all be dead.

285
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,466
And now he may kill us.

286
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,259
I'm about to die because of you.

287
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,094
-Watch your mouth.
-I'm fine right now.

288
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,597
That's enough, all of you! Shut it.

289
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,765
-Ms. Park--
-Silence.

290
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,932
-She--
-Hey!

291
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,526
Let's do this.

292
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,489
Stay in the recording room
for just ten minutes, Gyeong-su.

293
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,242
I know it'll be hard, but I think
that's better than being suspected.

294
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,579
The others don't suspect me.
It's just her.

295
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,373
Gyeong-su, would you do that, please?

296
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,419
Forget ten minutes. I'll stay half…

297
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,546
No, a full hour.

298
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,841
There's no need for that.
It takes less than five minutes to turn.

299
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,718
-Stop overreacting.
-Let's just be sure.

300
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,471
Will that do?

301
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,433
If nothing happens,
you'll sincerely apologize, right?

302
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,353
Yes.

303
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,232
You guys are all okay with that, right?

304
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,399
-Yes.
-Yes.

305
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,028
He's clearly fine. If we do this,
who would step up next time?

306
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,822
Everyone will hide.

307
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,574
You're right, too, but…

308
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,498
let's consider this a way
to learn to trust each other.

309
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,169
I trust Gyeong-su.

310
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,842
See you in an hour.

311
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,011
Should I go in with you?

312
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,065
That stubborn punk.

313
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,151
Ten minutes would be fine.

314
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,237
He's nothing compared to her.

315
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,509
-Go get it.
-No.

316
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,927
You little…

317
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,179
Stop it.

318
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,263
Go get it.

319
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,852
Move. Stop that.

320
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,380
Hey.

321
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,425
Come here.

322
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,579
Damn it.

323
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,777
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

324
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,195
Maybe they're drawn to smell.

325
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,614
They go after you like crazy.

326
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,533
I don't smell.

327
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,410
You sweat a lot.

328
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,578
I sweat, but I don't smell.

329
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,998
What is that smell?

330
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,791
Your sweat.

331
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,838
I think they're more sensitive
to sound than smell.

332
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,631
-Sound?
-Yes, sound.

333
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,675
This isn't a movie.

334
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,469
That's how most zombies are.

335
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,722
And you saw their eyes.

336
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,890
They can't see with those eyes.

337
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,435
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

338
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,645
Sound or smell, I don't know, but…

339
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,856
Some kids probably left the school, right?

340
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,774
Really?

341
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,235
Yes, probably.

342
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,571
Here, Su-hyeok.

343
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,655
Give me the mirror.

344
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,825
Should we consider ourselves
the lucky ones?

345
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,956
The fact that we're alive

346
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,459
means we're lucky.

347
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,087
Is that true?

348
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,465
Yes.

349
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,300
Wipe your face.

350
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,500
Are you okay?

351
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,419
I keep thinking about I-sak.

352
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,463
But you held onto her

353
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,174
until the very end.

354
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,970
Stop it. That's not comforting.

355
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,681
You did nothing wrong.

356
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,935
Be strong.

357
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,938
Your dad or somebody else

358
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,191
will come to save us.

359
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,536
FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

360
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,122
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

361
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,332
Goodness.

362
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,545
Must you put your son's face on the sign?

363
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,755
What's wrong with using my own son's face?

364
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,092
You'll end up becoming
an evil mother-in-law.

365
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,179
Being all protective of your son while
nagging your daughter-in-law like crazy.

366
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,726
Right.

367
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,147
I'll go submit these
at the District Office.

368
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,159
The series of incidents
occurring in Hyosan

369
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,329
appear to be due to a mass outbreak
of a highly infectious virus.

370
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,833
We'll speak to the Disease Control Center
for more details.

371
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,627
Director Cha Hyeon-seok,
what's the current situation?

372
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,838
Considering the level of spread,

373
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,841
it appears to be
a highly infectious disease.

374
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,886
Those suspected of being infected
became unusually aggressive.

375
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:36,016
The victims showed similar symptoms,
so we suspect secondary infections.

376
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,060
As you've heard, this is very serious.

377
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,104
On advice from the KDCA,

378
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,316
the government has raised
the infectious disease alert to "serious."

379
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,735
They stated that
they will do everything possible

380
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,987
to prevent it
from spreading outside of Hyosan.

381
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,072
This just in.

382
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,575
The National Security Council has decided

383
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,370
to issue an evacuation
of Hyosan in Gyeonggi.

384
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,332
If you are watching this,

385
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,376
please leave the city immediately.

386
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,004
I repeat. The situation is very serious.

387
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,256
The National Security Council has decided

388
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,344
to issue an evacuation
of Hyosan in Gyeonggi.

389
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,429
If you are watching this,

390
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,557
please leave the city immediately.

391
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:25,065
-I'm going to step out for a minute.
-Okay.

392
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,402
Are you all right?

393
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,488
Yes, I'm fine.

394
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,156
I'm fine. I…

395
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,450
I…

396
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,118
I'll be back soon.

397
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,707
A virus?

398
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,668
What type of virus?

399
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,255
I don't think it's a droplet infection,
but it hasn't been confirmed.

400
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,424
You seem to get infected if you get bit,

401
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,969
so don't get bit or make physical contact.

402
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,888
We don't have
any information on the virus yet,

403
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,225
so make sure to avoid contact.

404
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,187
I hear an assembly member is there.

405
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,897
-Hold still.
-Who is it?

406
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,193
Yeong-hwan.

407
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,947
What the…

408
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,577
Yeong-hwan, are you okay?

409
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,621
Hey. Captain, what do we do?

410
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,040
Yeong-hwan!

411
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,668
Hey.

412
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,422
That's what happened to our aide earlier.

413
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:32,924
It's the same.

414
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,636
Shit.

415
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,973
Is he dead?

416
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,189
Hey!

417
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,489
U-sin!

418
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,283
Get the rope!

419
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,952
-Hurry!
-Tie him up!

420
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,625
Tie him up! Hurry!

421
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,129
We've got approximately 200 infected
at Hyosan Intersection.

422
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,757
Unit 1030, 1040, 1050.

423
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,384
Move to Hyosan Intersection.

424
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,429
Copy that. This is Unit 1030.

425
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,389
We're heading to Hyosan Intersection.

426
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,141
Brace for impact!

427
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,154
Go join the line!

428
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,037
Block them!

429
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,418
Stand firm!

430
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,257
Join the line!

431
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,510
Wait. Hey!

432
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,807
Stop! Stop right there.

433
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,435
-Go back.
-I'll be quick.

434
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,519
What are you doing?

435
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,688
She wants to get through.

436
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,356
You need to go.

437
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,483
-My son--
-You need to evacuate.

438
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,569
-Get her out of here.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,113
-No. Wait.
-Escort her out of here.

440
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,657
My son, Cheong-san. Wait!

441
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,064
I'm sorry.

442
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,610
Do you go to Hyosan High?
What are you doing here?

443
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,945
Is the school okay?

444
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,448
Hey. Do you know Cheong-san?

445
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,909
Lee Cheong-san? Do you know him?

446
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,544
Oh no.

447
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,722
Hey. Lift me more.

448
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,224
That's the highest I can go.

449
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,142
Get on your tippy-toes.

450
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,685
I did.

451
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,479
Do you see anything?

452
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,566
Shit. There are so many zombies.

453
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,236
-Put me down.
-Okay.

454
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,238
Let me down. Careful.

455
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,239
Okay.

456
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,242
Why is this so hard?
-Are you okay?

457
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,952
-That hurts.
-Yes.

458
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,122
What do we do?

459
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,416
First.

460
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,460
Do you have cigarettes?

461
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,878
I don't smoke.

462
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,464
Damn, you totally look like a smoker.

463
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,424
Hey, what about you?

464
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,553
-I don't smoke.
-Don't mess with me.

465
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,012
I don't.

466
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,558
Is that how you talk to a senior?
Want to die?

467
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,769
Whatever. Look who's talking.

468
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,147
Hey. Who taught you
to talk like that to a senior?

469
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
-Sorry.
-Hey.

470
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,409
I'm the one you should apologize to.

471
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,538
Athletes are all douchebags. Fuck.

472
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,790
Watch your mouth.

473
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,916
Watch your body.

474
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,544
Must you guys fight right now?

475
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,546
Don't you have brains? Are you babies?

476
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,216
Sorry.

477
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,135
I said I was sorry.

478
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,595
Let's get out of here.

479
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,305
How can we leave?

480
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,557
They'll eat us all if they see us.

481
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,352
If you want to leave, go by yourself.
I'm not going.

482
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,980
-What about you?
-Don't ask.

483
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,565
I'll do whatever I feel like.

484
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,735
Damn. What a cold bitch.

485
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,572
Hey. Make some weapons.

486
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,741
Come on.

487
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,493
Give me that.

488
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,481
Moron.

489
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,650
Hey.

490
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,402
I'll kill you.

491
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,543
That moron.

492
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,004
What is that?

493
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:48,925
Thirty minutes.

494
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,013
-What are you saying?
-It's been 30 minutes. Come out.

495
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,196
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but Gyeong-su won't come out.

496
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,865
Okay. I'll bring him out.

497
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,536
What's wrong with him?

498
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,582
He's fine.

499
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,002
-He's totally fine.
-I knew it.

500
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,881
-Why is he being so stubborn?
-He won't come out, right?

501
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,262
He's so pigheaded.

502
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,555
He's so stubborn.

503
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,850
What?

504
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,187
What did he say?

505
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,188
He won't come out?

506
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,191
He says he'll stay the full hour.

507
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,693
He's sulking.

508
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,570
I'll go in.

509
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,738
Why should you?

510
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,824
If anyone should go in, it's Na-yeon.

511
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,704
Why should I?

512
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,831
He's like that because of you.

513
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,042
-What did I do?
-Like you don't know?

514
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,460
Was it wrong to suspect him?

515
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,379
You did too. Every last one of you.

516
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,841
I didn't suspect him.

517
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,759
Me neither.

518
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,261
I did. She's right.

519
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,139
But I didn't look down on him
like you did.

520
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,267
-Why are you picking on me?
-You're the only one acting that way.

521
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,685
That's enough, Ji-min.

522
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,988
You remember your promise, right?

523
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,157
That you'd apologize after 30 minutes.

524
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,576
Yes.

525
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,415
It's been 30 minutes.

526
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,002
Fine.

527
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,882
She's going to him.

528
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,556
Hey.

529
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,684
I'm talking to you.

530
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,063
Are you ignoring me?

531
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:55,570
-Are you starting a fight again?
-They're talking. It's looking good.

532
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,198
-Why didn't you answer?
-Unless you're here to apologize, get out.

533
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,867
How's your cut?

534
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,993
What's it to you?

535
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,162
Let me see.

536
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,375
She grabbed his hand. Oh my God.

537
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,670
Talk about being forward.

538
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,429
I suspected you

539
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,056
because the situation called for it.

540
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,143
And I was really mad earlier.

541
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,938
I'm still mad now.

542
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,608
I guess that's…

543
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,027
Does Gyeong-su like that stuff?

544
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,613
I have no idea.

545
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,783
You know I've always
looked down on you, right?

546
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,956
It's fine. It's all in the past. Let's go.

547
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,583
What's fine?

548
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,169
You deserve to be looked down on.

549
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,714
Our complex banned you welfies,
but you still cut through.

550
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,966
And you dare push me?

551
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,801
You fucking…

552
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,136
You thought I'd apologize?

553
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,388
They're going to kiss.

554
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,099
They must be crazy.

555
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,227
Everyone's taking your side.

556
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,813
I was cornered
because of a nobody like you.

557
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,191
Stay the full hour.

558
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,569
Although I hope you never come out.

559
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,573
Damn welfie.

560
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,075
They're coming.

561
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,161
-Hey!
-How nice was that? How nice--

562
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,330
-Gyeong-su!
-You little--

563
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,207
-What's wrong?
-Gyeong-su, what's wrong?

564
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,668
You're really a fucking…

565
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,045
Seriously…

566
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,637
-Why must I always take it?
-Did you really say that?

567
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,722
You promised me.

568
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,849
I did nothing wrong.

569
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,102
You only think about yourself.

570
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,521
You said not to let our friends in.

571
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,690
You said to close the door
before they came in.

572
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,857
That's not right.

573
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,070
We almost died
because Gyeong-su pulled Mr. Kang in.

574
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,989
But you don't say a word about that?

575
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,159
He didn't pull him in.
He didn't know that would happen.

576
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,246
-That's enough. Quiet, everyone.
-We'd be quiet if she was gone.

577
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,832
Whatever.

578
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,834
All of you are so annoying.

579
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,004
What if I'm right?

580
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,215
Then will you admit I saved you?

581
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,177
How could you still be this way?

582
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,976
Look.

583
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,438
See if I'm right or wrong.

584
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,363
What?

585
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,954
Gyeong-su.

586
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,924
Day 26 of infection.

587
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,137
See? You still think I'm wrong?

588
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,932
The strong cells are attacking
the weak cells.

589
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,728
Every single cell
is struggling to survive…

590
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,315
and attacking each other.

591
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,276
This virus is the will to survive defined.

592
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,738
It consumes all the cells
almost instantly.

593
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,789
Hey. What's wrong with me?
Something's wrong with me.

594
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,917
What the fuck.

595
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,044
What's wrong with you?

596
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,047
It's not true.

597
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,176
Get rid of him. Get rid of him now!

598
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,470
-No, I--
-Stop it, Gyeong-su.

599
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,390
Don't do that.

600
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,810
Fuck, I'm not!

601
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,354
I'm sorry, Gyeong-su.

602
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,773
Still, don't do it.

603
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,699
I've turned, right?

604
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,619
Cheong-san, what do I do?

605
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,212
No. No, it can't be. Why would you…

606
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,171
Cheong-san.

607
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,131
Let go.

608
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,300
Moron. It's not true.

609
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,636
Why would you suddenly…

610
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,348
The infected human feels extreme fear…

611
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,438
Then they attack only to survive.

612
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,942
Hey. You weren't bit.

613
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,944
Stay away. Don't come any closer! Fuck!

614
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,621
What are you doing? Tell him to get out.

615
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,374
We're all going to die!

616
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
Why…

617
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,254
Fuck, why am I…

618
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,464
Fuck.

619
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,013
Get out. I said to get out!

620
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,348
Shut up! Fuck!

621
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,850
I'll leave.

622
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,020
I'll leave on my own.

623
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,817
Why would I bite you?
We're fucking friends.

624
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,280
If I leave, it'll all be fine.

625
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,285
Gyeong-su,

626
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,163
why don't you just go back
into the recording--

627
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,915
What will you do if we all die?

628
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,916
Na-yeon!

629
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,542
We have to live.

630
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,007
I'll leave.

631
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,774
I'll get out of here on my own.

632
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,612
Sorry, I'll get out of here.

633
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,449
Gyeong-su.

634
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,577
It's okay.

635
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,622
Thank you, guys, for everything.

636
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,207
Really.

637
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,292
Stay alive.

638
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,802
Are you all right, Gyeong-su?

639
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,388
That moron.

640
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,975
What are you looking at?

641
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,938
Why are you doing that?
You're scaring me. Stop that.

642
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,109
Stop it.
Cheong-san, why are you doing that?

643
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,028
Stop it! Stop it, please! I'm scared!

644
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,019
Oh no!

645
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:40,028
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

646
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,575
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BEGINNING

647
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,685
-Here. Lift it.
-Okay.

648
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,770
Here.

649
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,022
Lift it.

650
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,991
The Disaster and Safety Management said
not to touch the infected.

651
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,870
As you can see, it's highly contagious--

652
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,623
We were notified too.
No need to explain it to us.

653
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,460
How long will we stay here?

654
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,046
They're sending a helicopter,
but it's taking some time.

655
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,006
So you'll have to wait a while longer.

656
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,010
Did you notify them that I'm here?

657
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:27,970
Pardon?

658
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,433
Is it taking time to get a chopper
even though they know I'm here?

659
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,060
I didn't report that you were here.

660
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,188
You should've told them

661
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,023
so they'd send one quickly.

662
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,612
As per the rules of rescue,
the weak and critically ill

663
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,573
take priority over people of status.

664
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,618
We'll hear from them soon,
so please wait a little longer.

665
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,878
ON-JO'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

666
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,588
Is the helicopter even coming?

667
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,299
Yes, I'm sure it will.
Why don't we rest for now?

668
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,305
The person you have called is unavailable.

669
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,269
This is Capt. Nam So-ju
of Rescue Team One.

670
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,147
If anyone knows the situation
at Hyosan High School,

671
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,773
please respond. Over.

672
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,326
If anyone knows of the situation
at Hyosan High School or its vicinity,

673
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,202
please respond. Over.

674
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,296
Please respond.

675
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,257
RESCUE

676
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,102
Gyeong-su, that punk.

677
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,855
He was such a good kid.

678
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,483
Why did he have to turn?

679
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,987
I told you

680
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
he was infected.

681
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,909
Are you happy?

682
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,079
You were all wrong. Only I was right.

683
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,623
What if you didn't have me?

684
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,750
Hey.

685
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:26,922
Maybe you did it.

686
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:27,965
What?

687
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,141
I saw…

688
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,228
what you did.

689
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,024
What? What did you see?

690
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,275
You did it.

691
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,152
I didn't do it.

692
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,737
I didn't do that to Gyeong-su.

693
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,823
I didn't mention him.

694
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,075
Stop that.

695
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,785
What do you mean?

696
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,829
I didn't do it.

697
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,165
While we were all looking at him,
you were in the back alone.

698
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,336
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but Gyeong-su won't come out.

699
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,800
Okay. I'll bring him out.

700
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,262
What's wrong with him?

701
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,101
He's fine.

702
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,728
-He's totally fine.
-I knew it.

703
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,230
He should just come out.

704
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,233
He's still not coming out?

705
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,651
I guess not.

706
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,903
Hasn't he been in there long enough?

707
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,659
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

708
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,331
No, I didn't.

709
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,459
You rubbed that
on Gyeong-su's wound, right?

710
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,670
-I didn't.
-Your handkerchief is in your pocket.

711
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,213
-And if it is?
-Take it out.

712
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,049
-No.
-Take it out.

713
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,550
I said, no.

714
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,260
Should I take it out?

715
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,387
Damn it.

716
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,806
Who the hell do you think you are?

717
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,683
Is classroom president special?

718
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,604
Since when did you consider me
your classroom president?

719
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,230
Nam-ra, that's enough.

720
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,611
Nam-ra, do you realize what you're saying?

721
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,237
If that's true,

722
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,741
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

723
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,201
It's true.

724
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,204
Na-yeon…

725
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,624
killed Gyeong-su.

726
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,335
You fucking bitch.

727
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,670
There you go.

728
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,214
Satisfied?

729
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,762
There's blood on it.

730
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,722
I wiped Gyeong-su's wound.

731
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,100
This is Gyeong-su's blood?

732
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,184
Can't you tell?

733
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,395
Then put it on your wound.

734
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,026
Wipe your wound with it if you're so sure.

735
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,445
Like his blood is clean?

736
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,656
He became a zombie.

737
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,245
He was fine until you rubbed him
with your handkerchief.

738
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,996
Na-yeon, you--

739
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,456
Fuck! It wasn't me!

740
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,214
Don't do it. Stop it.

741
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,423
Let go.

742
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,217
I said to stop it.

743
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,885
Give it to me.

744
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,846
Leave me alone! Fuck!

745
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,850
I'll just die too, then.

746
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,518
That's what you want, isn't it?

747
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,818
What makes Gyeong-su better than me?

748
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,948
That dirty welfie pushed me.

749
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,203
Na-yeon, you didn't…

750
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,455
Hey. Did you do it?

751
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,624
-Calm down.
-How could you--

752
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,418
I didn't kill him!

753
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,921
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

754
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,048
He's still alive.

755
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,134
He didn't die. He turned.

756
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
Are you kidding me?

757
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,429
Why are you all picking on me?

758
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,474
You all laughed when I said he smelled.

759
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,810
You all badmouthed him too.

760
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,520
Why are you acting innocent now?

761
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,647
-That little…
-Cheong-san.

762
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,608
Why did you kill him?

763
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,567
Stop it.

764
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,868
You're…

765
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,164
a murderer.

766
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,730
I…

767
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,900
I have no friends.

768
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,696
I don't need any of you.

769
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,199
Fuck this.

770
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,045
Hey!

771
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:33,895
Guys.

772
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,151
No matter what happens, don't die.

773
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,697
And don't let anyone else die.

774
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,501
If you cause someone else to die,

775
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,963
living becomes meaningless.

776
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,675
Okay?

777
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,820
Ms. Park!

778
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,780
Dae-su, don't go.

779
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,700
She left.

780
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,605
Fuck!

781
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,145
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

782
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,064
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
