3
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,955
Stuart.

4
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,459
Illumination!

5
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:33,664
Phil, Ron, Ralph, stay focused!

6
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,834
Ah. Okay, okay.

7
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:45,343
Okay, our target
is Maxime Le Mal,

8
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:48,380
one of the Anti-Villain
League's most wanted.

9
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,249
And trust me, a real jerk.

10
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:55,220
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

11
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,987
Si, boss.

12
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:01,193
{\an8}Uh, boss? Uh, Gru?

13
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,402
Phil! Ron!

14
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,103
Looka! Looka! Oh!

15
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,606
Yummos!

16
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,107
Come here, come here.

17
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:21,246
Pusha. Pusha.

18
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:26,251
Helpa. Ah, helpa.

19
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,153
Ah. Oh, helpa.

20
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,889
Kids can be so cruel,

21
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,259
but Maxime can be even crueler!

22
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,533
Well, well, well.

23
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,900
Look who it is.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,869
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

25
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,540
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal.

26
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,674
You look...

27
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,276
Magnificent?

28
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,277
Yes, I know.

29
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:54,546
What did you think, huh?
I was going to look

30
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:57,649
like a bald loser
with a dad bod?

31
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,750
Oops, looks like
you beat me to it, no?

32
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,153
Well, that's not...

33
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:05,257
Ooh!

34
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,260
It's good to laugh, no?

35
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:12,997
Anyway, you remember
my girlfriend, Valentina?

36
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:16,134
She was captain of
the Femme Fatales cheer squad

37
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:19,738
and the most popular girl
in school, huh?

38
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,506
I remember.

39
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,541
Good to see you, Valentina.

40
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,246
What happened, Gru?

41
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:31,349
All your dreams of becoming
a famous villain,

42
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,850
they go poof-poof, huh?

43
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,919
Well, I don't know if you know,

44
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,290
but I did manage
to steal the moon.

45
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,491
Really?

46
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,593
You mean that moon?

47
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:45,829
Is this on?

48
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,266
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

49
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:53,204
Good evening, and welcome,
Lycee Pas Bon alumni.

50
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:56,341
Now, we're going to kick off
the festivities

51
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,345
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

52
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,514
the Golden Alumni.

53
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,319
And so, without further ado,

54
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:13,191
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is, uh...

55
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,696
oh, my favorite student,
Maxime Le Mal!

56
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:19,397
- What? What?
- Oh, thank you.

57
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:20,699
Are you kidding me?

58
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,600
Thank you. <i>Merci.
Merci beaucoup.</i>

59
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:23,934
<i>Mais non,</i> you don't have to.

60
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,111
Thank you.

61
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,978
I'm sure you all know
that I have

62
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,948
something very big in the works.

63
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,818
Now, some of you laughed

64
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,721
at my childhood obsession
with cockroaches.

65
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,756
But I quickly learned

66
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,459
that they are a miracle
of evolution.

67
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,164
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

68
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,167
and the speed and the--
what is the word?

69
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:59,804
unsquishability of
the most powerful creature

70
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,306
on the planet.

71
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:06,544
Which makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

72
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:07,645
Maxime!

73
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,947
Maxime! Maxime!

74
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:14,285
Behold, the power
of the cockroach!

75
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,477
Aah, aah! Stop! Oh, oh, stoppa!

76
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:41,746
Aah! Stoppa!

77
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,782
So, my sad little friend,

78
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,916
what do you say about that, huh?

79
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:49,953
Well, I'd say
you're under arrest,

80
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:53,091
courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

81
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,894
Oh, I don't think so, <i>mon ami.</i>

82
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,729
Oh, yeah? Goop Grenade!

83
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:10,941
Move in.

84
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,510
- AVL!
- Stay where you are!

85
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,745
Move, move, move!

86
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,623
Stay there!

87
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,193
Freeze!

88
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:35,867
Gotcha.

89
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,268
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

90
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:38,770
This is not happening.

91
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,672
<i>C'est impossible.</i>

92
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,373
Get your hands off of me!

93
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,909
I...
I am commanding you to let...

94
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:47,812
So long, Maxime.

95
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,781
Who's the loser now?

96
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,882
Loser!

97
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,851
Loser! Loser!

98
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,662
This is not over!

99
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,899
You won't always have the AVL

100
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:09,501
to fight your battles,
you coward.

101
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,971
Mark my words,
I will exterminate you!

102
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,074
What?

103
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,946
Not, uh... not scary at all.

104
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:40,231
Hello, everybody.

105
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,100
- Gru, what's up?
- Hey, Gru!

106
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,035
- Hey, Gru.
- I'm so happy you're here!

107
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,070
What's shaking in the Gru house?

108
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,239
Look what I taught Lucky.

109
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,942
Lucky, sit.

110
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,813
Aw, Lucky. I said "sit."

111
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:02,220
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,756
Uh, maybe we practice outside
from now on.

113
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,225
There's my favorite husband.

114
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:09,260
Did you remember
to get the milk?

115
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,262
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

116
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,665
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

117
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,768
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

118
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,170
powdered and of magnesia.

119
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,339
What about regular milk?

120
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,708
Uh, they don't make that
anymore.

121
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:26,511
Wait a minute.

122
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,314
One, two, three girls.

123
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:30,548
One wife.

124
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,084
Something is missing.

125
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:36,254
No, I think that's
all of us, yeah.

126
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:39,058
You know what,
I keep forgetting-- this guy!

127
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,063
There's my boy!

128
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:46,097
There he is.

129
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,932
A-coochie-coochie-
coochie-coochie.

130
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,002
Where is Daddy's hug?

131
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:53,137
Oh, looks like somebody's
a little cranky.

132
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:56,708
Behind that sourpuss,

133
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,243
I know you love your dada!

134
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,746
Go on, say it. "Dada."

135
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:03,281
"Dada."

136
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:04,782
Yes, of course he loves you.

137
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:08,053
He just... he just doesn't
show it on his face.

138
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:09,520
Or with his body language.

139
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:12,123
Right, Gru Jr.? Come on.

140
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:14,158
Show Daddy
how much you love him.

141
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:17,829
Oh, I know what
will make you happy.

142
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,164
Mmm. Bahama Medley.

143
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,302
No?

144
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,838
It's from the Bahamas--
all of them.

145
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:30,141
Look. Oh, so yummy.

146
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,116
Oh, that really tastes
like the Bahamas.

147
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,118
See? He loves his daddy.

148
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:41,120
He's sharing.

149
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,124
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

150
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,652
Thanks, guys.

151
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,322
Ramsbottom?

152
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,992
"Bottom."

153
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,960
I need a word with you both.

154
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,395
- Sure, but what...
- I'm sorry,

155
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:25,897
there's no time for chitchat.

156
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:29,134
Maxime Le Mal has sent you
a message from prison.

157
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:32,537
<i>Bonjour, Gru.</i>

158
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,972
I know you can hear me,
so hear this.

159
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:39,243
You think you can humiliate me
and get away with it, yes?

160
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:41,479
But no!
When I break out of prison,

161
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,581
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru,

162
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,851
but this time,
I won't go so easy on you.

163
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,388
And I know where you live,

164
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,390
so you'd better sleep
with one eye open,

165
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,060
'cause you can't hide from me.

166
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,761
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

167
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,766
Don't worry,
he can't get out of there.

168
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,402
It's a maximum security prison.

169
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,337
Ah, yes, well, um...

170
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,473
he escaped yesterday.

171
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,741
What?!

172
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,242
Leave our home?

173
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:12,910
Oh, no, you're gonna love it.

174
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,479
It's-it's called the safe house,

175
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,380
and it's fun, and it's safe,

176
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,583
and it's fantastic,
and we're going.

177
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:21,153
Yeah, you'll get a new room,
go to a new school.

178
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,687
That'll be fun, right?

179
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,255
Everything's gonna be new.
We love new.

180
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,324
What about all my friends?

181
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,926
You'll make new friends,
probably better ones.

182
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:33,132
- I can't believe this.
- Yes, yes.

183
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,932
Lot of emotions,
big life change.

184
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,367
Less talking, more walking.

185
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,170
Come on. Here we go.

186
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,915
I'm sorry you can't go with us,
Lucky.

187
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,887
Take good care of him.

188
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,422
Be good, Lucky.

189
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:02,027
Don't forget to practice
your tricks.

190
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,900
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

191
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,002
Mayflower is a lovely town.

192
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:13,571
A lovely, safe, boring town.

193
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,406
Trust me,
it is for the best, Gru.

194
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,109
And what about Grandma?

195
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,643
And Uncle Dru?

196
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:21,779
I'm sorry, no one can know
of your whereabouts.

197
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,713
Not even family.

198
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,849
Bingo,
there's your silver lining.

199
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:27,652
And you promise to take care
of the other Minions?

200
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,888
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL headquarters.

201
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:33,058
I have big plans for them.

202
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,693
Good luck with that.

203
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:56,447
That is it!

204
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:06,657
Quiet!

205
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:11,263
You are now on Carl's bus.

206
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,665
And Carl is
a longtime AVL employee

207
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:17,535
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested,

208
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:20,638
so while on Carl's bus,

209
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,773
you follow Carl's rules.

210
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:27,212
No shenanigans, no antics
and no tomfoolery.

211
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,813
Tom?

212
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:31,682
So this ends now,
or you're gonna see

213
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:35,320
a side of Carl
you do not want to see.

214
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:38,389
Do I make myself clear?!

215
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,757
Bazooka!

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,767
Carl does not like this!

217
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,435
Watch your hands.
What are you doing?

218
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,504
Who's pinching?! No!

219
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:02,381
<i>Here we are,
the town of Mayflower.</i>

220
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,714
The safe house has been used

221
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:06,517
to protect our agents
for decades now.

222
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,452
Oh, look at that place.

223
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,855
Wow, look at these lawns,
the flowers.

224
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,292
Whoa, that is cool!

225
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,592
Are we really gonna live here?

226
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,395
- Look at that fountain!
- Whoa.

227
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,462
Awesome.

228
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:19,897
Oh, is that one ours?

229
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,134
- Uh, uh, looka.
- Whoa! -MARGO: Look at that!

230
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:23,567
Oh, that's pretty!

231
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,670
I could get used to this.

232
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:31,575
<i>Ooh, it looks like
a princess lives there!</i>

233
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,012
And here it is.

234
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,548
Your new home.

235
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,723
Hmm. No fountain.

236
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,093
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

237
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,827
Come on.

238
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,575
Wow, it's so...
cold and uninviting.

239
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,211
But in a homey kind of way.

240
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:07,478
What?

241
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,581
Yes, everything here
is AVL standard.

242
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:11,916
What it lacks in comfort,

243
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,086
it more than makes up for
in functionality.

244
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:17,989
Th-There's even a fully
automated lockdown mode.

245
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,358
Isn't that fun?

246
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,492
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

247
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:22,793
Yay.

248
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,097
It has a vending machine!

249
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,499
I love this place!

250
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:34,805
Uh, uh, looka.

251
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,677
This will be great.

252
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,413
All right, now down to business.

253
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:45,484
For your own safety, you'll all
be assuming new identities.

254
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,885
New identities?
Is that really necessary?

255
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,954
It's not up for debate, Gru.

256
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:52,723
Now, you are
a solar panel salesman.

257
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:56,161
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
at an upscale salon.

258
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,330
A hair stylist?

259
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,964
Yes! Jackpot!

260
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,899
Silas, did you choose that
because you knew

261
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,969
I cut my own hair and that
I would totally rock at this?

262
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,072
No.

263
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:08,539
"Chet Cunningham."

264
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,443
Da, that's got
a nice ring to it.

265
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,710
Girls.

266
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,212
Cool.

267
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:15,913
I'm Blair.

268
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,282
Britney?

269
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:18,849
My name is Bree?

270
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,253
Oh, come on. There are
worse names than Bree.

271
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,255
Yeah, like Blanche.

272
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:24,789
Yes, Margo.

273
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,225
Blanche?
Oh, that is a terrible name.

274
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:30,861
Imagine being named Blanche.

275
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:33,498
Truly, I cannot think
of a worse...

276
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,333
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

277
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,535
Yup.

278
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,303
Well, I'll get used to it.

279
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:41,639
Well, why don't you girls go
and pick out your rooms

280
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:44,109
while I have a word
with your parents?

281
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,413
Yes, I-I didn't want
to frighten the girls,

282
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:50,015
but it is absolutely crucial

283
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:52,317
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

284
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:56,587
Gru, you're going to have
to try to not be so Gru-ish.

285
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,156
What is that supposed to mean?

286
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:01,792
Well, I'm just saying you tend
to stand out in a crowd.

287
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:03,794
That's all. You know, you, uh...

288
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,164
Like the way you're always
cranky and irritable

289
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:08,567
and, uh, how you make things
a bit awkward

290
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,168
for everyone around you.

291
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:11,769
You do do that.

292
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,804
- I mean, you, you know, you...
- Okay, enough.

293
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:16,707
I don't make people awkward
or uncomfortable.

294
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,709
I'm very comforting.

295
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,711
Like a nice meat loaf.

296
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,148
I'm pretty delicious.

297
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,053
This is not awkward.

298
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:29,854
You're the ones
who are making it awkward.

299
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:31,922
Gru, you have to blend in.

300
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:34,159
Your family's lives
are at stake.

301
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,494
You understand?

302
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,162
Of course. Yes.
Fully understand.

303
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,997
We would do anything to keep
our family safe. Yeah.

304
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,568
Right, well, I'll be in contact
when this is all over.

305
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,471
Until then,
capturing Maxime Le Mal

306
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:48,973
is our top priority.

307
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,642
Stay safe.

308
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:56,047
You know what, Gru?
Maybe this isn't so bad.

309
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,383
We need a break
from chasing down villains

310
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:00,684
and dangerous missions, right?

311
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,054
We can actually be
a normal family for once.

312
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,689
And I can finally spend

313
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,527
some little bonding time
with the baby.

314
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:11,029
It's gonna be great, right, pal?

315
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,031
Who's got your nose?
Who's got...

316
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:16,000
Aah! He's got my nose!

317
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:18,603
Quite the grip there.

318
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:19,970
The kid is strong.

319
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,811
Thank you. Look at everyone.

320
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,914
Yes. We are having
a good time, right?

321
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,725
No, I love you.

322
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,728
Thank you, my beautiful army.

323
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:21,132
Maxime's back, baby!

324
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:25,270
And a special <i>merci beaucoup</i>

325
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,173
to everyone who helped me
break out of AVL prison.

326
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:30,475
Todd and Linda, where are you?
Where are you?

327
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:31,909
Yes. For distracting the guards.

328
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:34,479
<i>Oh, très magnifique.</i>

329
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:37,182
Now, silence!

330
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:40,518
We must make Gru suffer
for arresting me.

331
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,323
And what better way
than to take away from him

332
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,192
his precious little baby?

333
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,728
Oh, I want to take that baby!

334
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,566
- Oh, Maxime.
- No, no, wait, wait.

335
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,933
Not Maxime.

336
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:59,003
What if I start going
by Cockroach Man?

337
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,006
Huh? Little on the nose,
but it is very clear, huh?

338
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,675
It's good, no?

339
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:05,909
I'm not calling you
that stupid name,

340
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,513
but I love this evil plan.

341
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,115
Well, Gru has it coming.

342
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:13,051
He humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

343
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,254
I had my trophy and everything.

344
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:19,658
But now the game begins!

345
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,726
He runs and hides
like the mouse,

346
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:25,096
and we find him like the cat!

347
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,165
Game on.

348
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,604
Stoppa. Stoppa.

349
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:35,573
{\an8}Stoppa. Stoppa.

350
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,010
{\an8}Stoppa!

351
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,688
Here you go...

352
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,690
Britney.

353
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,890
Wait.

354
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,660
I can't say my name is Britney.

355
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,529
That would be a lie.

356
00:21:57,629 --> 00:21:58,862
Yes.

357
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:01,566
But we aren't "stupposed"
to lie.

358
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,201
Don't think of it as lying.

359
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,804
Think of it as
high-stakes pretending.

360
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,005
Well, I'm not going to.

361
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:11,008
- Ah, just a little white lie.
- Nope.

362
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:14,212
Agnes, as your father,
I command you to lie.

363
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:15,013
No.

364
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:17,015
Yes, lie.

365
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:20,085
You are walking on thin ice,
little lady.

366
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:20,984
Hmph.

367
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,955
Why can't you be more like
your sister Edith?

368
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:26,825
She lies all the time.

369
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,959
- No, I don't.
- See? See?

370
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,695
She's lying right now.

371
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:31,962
Beautifully, I might add.

372
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:33,331
Okay, you guys.

373
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,133
This is our first big day
in Mayflower,

374
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,602
and I say we make it
a great one.

375
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:39,237
Right, Chet Jr.?

376
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:40,871
Woo-hoo! Mayflower!

377
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:42,674
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

378
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:44,242
We're gonna be late for karate.

379
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:45,943
- And you have to get Margo
to school. -Ah.

380
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,746
It's gonna be awesome.

381
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,214
- Yay.
- Hey.

382
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:52,717
You just have to put yourself
out there, and I promise,

383
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:55,019
Mayflower will love
Chet Cunningham.

384
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,422
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

385
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:00,158
And you, little man,
are gonna have

386
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:01,959
so much fun
with your daddy today.

387
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:06,765
Yep, just you and Dada.

388
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,767
Come on, say it. "Dada."

389
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,169
"Dada."

390
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:16,541
Gonna be a fun day.

391
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:36,895
Okay.

392
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,635
Thanks a lot, guys.

393
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,908
All right.

394
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:51,910
- Thanks, hon. Bye.
- Bye.

395
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,579
Look, Margo. Neighbors.

396
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,314
Hello!

397
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:58,783
Come on.

398
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:00,618
You got this, Chet.

399
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,657
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

400
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:07,192
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

401
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:11,696
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

402
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:14,132
Well, uh...

403
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:15,966
Solar panels.

404
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:19,002
That's it. I sell solar panels.

405
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:21,739
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

406
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,541
Yeah, no.

407
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,510
Uh, I think I'm good.

408
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,711
Good to know.

409
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,546
So, uh, what do you do, Perry?

410
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:30,281
I own Prescott Motors,

411
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,984
the largest auto dealer
in the state.

412
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:36,588
Wow. That's impressive.

413
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,690
This is my daughter Margo.

414
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,924
Bree, Dad.

415
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:41,693
Ah, yes.

416
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,394
Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

417
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,830
It's funny because
I was thinking...

418
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,265
I was thinking about a fish

419
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,400
I once had as a pet named Margo,

420
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:53,805
who lived in the pond
and, uh, then died.

421
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,343
Anyway, I, uh...

422
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:02,213
I am about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

423
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:05,583
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so...

424
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,652
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

425
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:09,721
That's a fun name to say.

426
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:11,523
You want to carpool with us?

427
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,024
No.

428
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,959
You can be friends with Bree.

429
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,261
Right, Bree?

430
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,863
You don't have any friends.

431
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,402
Well, love the chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

432
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:27,372
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so...

433
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,340
Ooh, country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

434
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,609
If I were ever invited
to a country club,

435
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:36,214
I am sure
that I would love it.

436
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:39,083
Yeah, well, we really
have to get going,

437
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:40,552
so nice meeting you, Chet.

438
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:43,821
Okay, cool.

439
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:48,092
Anytime you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

440
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:50,061
He's gonna text me.

441
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,230
That was painful.

442
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:59,337
You'll see, by lunchtime,
you will have forgotten

443
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,173
all about your old,
lousy friends.

444
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:05,076
Mm, not so sure about that.

445
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:16,821
Hey, honey, you got this.

446
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:18,990
You are smart. You are funny.

447
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,060
What's there to worry about, right?

448
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,661
They're gonna love you.

449
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,497
Thanks, Gru.

450
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,667
Buh-bye.

451
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,705
Oh, please let them love you.

452
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,578
Hey, Poppy.

453
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:50,254
Move it!

454
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,856
Sorry. My bad.

455
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:55,393
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

456
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,529
Ooh. Glassos.

457
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:29,494
All right, gentlemen, fall in.

458
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,331
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

459
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:34,999
{\an8}- Uh...
- Si.

460
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,069
As you may or may not know,

461
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:38,603
I was recently called out
of retirement

462
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:41,773
to head up the AVL's
new top secret initiative

463
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:44,208
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

464
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:46,078
And that's where you come in.

465
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:47,745
We need volunteers.

466
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,983
We are looking for the strong,
the mighty...

467
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,552
- ...the fearless.
- Uh, nope.

468
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:57,255
We need the best of the best.

469
00:27:57,355 --> 00:28:00,224
So, who's it going to be?

470
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:04,395
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

471
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:06,597
Uh, blumach.

472
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,500
The AVL is known

473
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,769
for cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

474
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,806
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents,

475
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:19,078
and I can think of no better
guinea pigs than you.

476
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:20,745
Guinea pig! Yeah!

477
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:25,184
You will be the first
to test our Super-serum,

478
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:27,719
designed to transform you
into elite agents

479
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:32,523
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

480
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:36,128
Or you might just explode.

481
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:37,895
We don't really know.

482
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:23,574
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

483
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,252
Cool!

484
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,553
Aw, you guys look adorable.

485
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:37,688
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

486
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,025
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

487
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,492
Hi-yah!

488
00:29:41,592 --> 00:29:44,362
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

489
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:46,764
That's the spirit. Oh!

490
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:50,001
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

491
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:53,004
Blair and Britney, right?

492
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,806
We will!

493
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:56,574
Okay. Bye, Mom.

494
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:57,942
Bye!

495
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,111
Gotcha.

496
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:00,878
Hi-yah!

497
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:02,713
Circle up, people.

498
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,618
Show respect for your sensei.

499
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,822
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

500
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,590
Hai!

501
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:19,298
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

502
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,133
You look like a sheepdog.

503
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,500
Sorry, Sensei.

504
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:26,038
Now, we have
two new students today

505
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:31,076
ready to begin their journey--
hi-yah! -- to awesomeness.

506
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,444
You, tiny girl.

507
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,847
Step forward
and tell us your name.

508
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:37,348
Um...

509
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,617
It's Britney.

510
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,487
m-my name?

511
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:46,424
I can't...

512
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:49,061
There's no "can't" in karate.

513
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,462
Ten push-ups after class!

514
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:53,497
Hey, that's not fair.

515
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,270
You better not be talking back
to your sensei.

516
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:03,774
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

517
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,411
I guess not.

518
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,480
Then why don't you go sit

519
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,849
in the corner
of disgrace and reflection

520
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:14,986
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

521
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:23,828
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

522
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:25,529
Yeah, probably.

523
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,831
Excuse me?

524
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:29,500
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

525
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,503
you picked the wrong dojo.

526
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,056
That was for my sister.

527
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,961
You broke my pinkie toe.

528
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:01,300
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

529
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,702
Okay, put this over here.

530
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:05,603
Hair gel.

531
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:07,339
- Hairspray.
- Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

532
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:09,341
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

533
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,411
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

534
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,279
Well, what can I say?

535
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,746
I'm good at what I do.

536
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:18,616
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

537
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:21,253
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

538
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,425
I have a hair emergency, people.

539
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:30,162
Where's what's-her-name?
Remy? Rhonda?

540
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,064
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

541
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,531
Rachel's on maternity leave.

542
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:36,034
What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

543
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:41,206
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

544
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:43,674
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

545
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,510
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

546
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:54,052
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

547
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:57,089
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

548
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:59,657
Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

549
00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:02,394
No, no, no, no,
that style is dead to me.

550
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:05,230
It's-it's time for
a whole new Melora.

551
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,399
I want this.

552
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,301
Wow.

553
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,635
Wow. Um...

554
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:15,573
Okay. Let's start with color.

555
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,509
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

556
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:22,314
A little of this.

557
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,082
Some of that.

558
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:25,516
And, ooh, that's pretty.

559
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,119
This isn't so hard.

560
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,827
What?

561
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:39,930
Should it be smoking?

562
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:41,233
Yes, uh-huh.

563
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,068
Smoking means it's working.

564
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,576
What's going on?

565
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,812
Perfect. No one panic.

566
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,015
Call 911!

567
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,888
Quickly, quickly.

568
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,958
Wonder where they're going.

569
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:13,198
Voilà.

570
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:14,899
My latest creation.

571
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:18,437
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

572
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,937
Ay, I love it.

573
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:22,074
Oh, and look at
the little antenna.

574
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:22,973
That's so cute.

575
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:25,043
It's not supposed
to be cute, no!

576
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,046
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

577
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:32,484
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking bald potato,

578
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,752
and his baby is mine.

579
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,987
Check this out.

580
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,371
No, I kid you not. I'm being...

581
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:54,972
Whoa!

582
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,741
Whoa!

583
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:14,658
Oh, this is going to be so good!

584
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:29,274
Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

585
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:30,609
I changed your diaper.

586
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,444
I've got your bottle,
your Binky.

587
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,645
And here are your balloons.

588
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,047
There you go.

589
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:37,915
You like those, right?

590
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:40,418
All right,
a little bit of me time.

591
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:16,421
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

592
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:19,157
Ugh, teenagers are the worst.

593
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,361
Yeah, babies are no picnic, either.

594
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:32,836
Junior!

595
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:47,519
Ah, okay, okay.

596
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,489
Dua Lipa. Prosciutto.

597
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:01,299
Fire in de bowl!

598
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,969
Good night, Ralph.

599
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,549
Hello, Gru.

600
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:18,683
Hello. Wha... Hey.

601
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:20,985
What. What the...

602
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,456
Oh. Hello, Poppy.

603
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:25,756
Did you say something?

604
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:28,560
Wha... My name's Chet,
by the way.

605
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,195
Chet Cunningham.

606
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:31,263
Gru?

607
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:34,165
Wha...
What does that even mean?

608
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,670
It means you're bad at lying.

609
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,205
Hey, that's not nice.

610
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:42,741
Ever hear of respecting
your elders?

611
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,676
I don't respect boomers.

612
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:46,278
I just mock them.

613
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:50,515
Is that, like, a joke
you read on the Web?

614
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,717
Wow. "The Web"?

615
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:54,352
How old are you?

616
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:57,188
Well, old enough to know
that you are a rotten little...

617
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:01,626
You better watch yourself.

618
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,061
Ooh.

619
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:05,697
You used to be a master villain.

620
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,965
That's not me.

621
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,933
I don't even see a resemblance.

622
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:12,671
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,

623
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:15,873
as I sell... mm, solar panels.

624
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:18,276
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

625
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,645
Because you're gonna help me
pull a heist.

626
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,514
We start planning tomorrow.

627
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:24,249
You want to pull a heist?

628
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,950
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

629
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:29,487
No, you listen, old man.

630
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:31,289
I own you.

631
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:35,760
And I promise,
you do not want to cross me.

632
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:37,395
Okay.

633
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:41,366
All right, but tomorrow
is-is not really good timing.

634
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:42,667
Bummer for you.

635
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,636
Because this is happening,

636
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,841
unless you want the whole world
to know exactly who you are...

637
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:55,046
...Gru.

638
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,384
She's terrifying.

639
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,558
Oh, looka!

640
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:11,596
Bello. Bello. Thank you.

641
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:14,998
Ooh!

642
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:24,843
Oh, thank you.

643
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,347
Yay!

644
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:30,448
Oh, blumach.

645
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:33,418
Hey, Jiminy! Tu cafe le colda?
No problemo.

646
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:57,509
Thank you.

647
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:02,013
All right, all right,
s-settle down.

648
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,848
Settle down!

649
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:05,383
Thank you.

650
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,719
It's time to get you out
for some real-world training.

651
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:12,257
And if you do well out there,

652
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:15,693
you'll be the AVL's
new secret weapon.

653
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:16,994
Pomodoro!

654
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:31,476
I'm quite sure
I won't regret this.

655
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:34,712
No, the painters canceled.

656
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:36,281
True story.

657
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:37,948
- Wow. -I don't know what is
the deal with these...

658
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,417
Morning, neighbors!

659
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:40,919
Hey there!

660
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:43,521
Still waiting on that invite,
Perry.

661
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:44,789
Uh...

662
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,957
- No. No. No, no.
- Yoo-hoo!

663
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:48,693
- Patsy.
- Oh, neighbors.

664
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,695
- Oh, Patsy.
- Hi there.

665
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,764
I'm Perry's wife Patsy.

666
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:53,932
Oh. I'm Blanche.

667
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:55,567
And this is Chet.

668
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:59,103
Hi. So I look over here,
and I see you, and...

669
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:01,272
I have one of
my brilliant ideas.

670
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,375
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

671
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:05,777
Oh, honey.

672
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:07,278
I... I don't know.

673
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,948
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

674
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:11,249
Much of a tennis guy?

675
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:13,051
I am too much of a tennis guy.

676
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,953
I'm Mr. Tennis.

677
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:18,189
It's my favorite
of all the sports games.

678
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:21,159
With the racket and, uh,
with the balls.

679
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,328
So yellow and fuzzy.

680
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,296
Oh, then we're all set.

681
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:27,098
See you two at the club
tomorrow.

682
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:29,133
Toodle-oo.

683
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,569
Okay. Toodle-oo to you two, too.

684
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,973
So, you-you play tennis?

685
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:37,876
Yes, yes, I play tennis.

686
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:40,178
I'm pretty fantastic, actually.

687
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:42,580
Well, at least I was
at summer camp.

688
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,815
Wow, that's great.

689
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,016
Here you go.

690
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:46,851
Mwah. Okay, bye.

691
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:49,521
Have fun.

692
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:52,190
There you go.

693
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,792
Okay.

694
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:06,271
{\an8}What the...

695
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:22,754
Gru.

696
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,622
You can't hide from me, Gru.

697
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:27,292
Ay, my back is killing me.

698
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:29,193
How long is this gonna take?

699
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,930
It will take
as long as it takes.

700
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,666
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

701
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:37,769
This won't be like
the ninth grade talent show.

702
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,071
Ay, again with this.

703
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:42,707
Yes, again.
It was a pivotal moment.

704
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:44,609
Why can't you indulge me?

705
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,713
It was the night
of the big show.

706
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:52,517
<i>I had practiced for weeks,</i>

707
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:56,120
<i>perfecting a number that would
blow my classmates away.</i>

708
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,925
<i>I was about to go on when...</i>

709
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,427
- What?
<i>- I heard it.</i>

710
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,163
Wait. Oh.

711
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,937
<i>There was that little jerk</i>

712
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:14,372
<i>doing my big number.</i>

713
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:19,811
He ruined everything.

714
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,112
I couldn't go on after him.

715
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:22,947
I would've looked like a fool.

716
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:24,916
Like I was copying him.

717
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:27,118
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

718
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:29,088
That was a very popular song.

719
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:31,090
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

720
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:32,924
He did it on purpose.

721
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:34,826
He reveled in humiliating me.

722
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:39,098
- What now?
- Ugh, we're low on fuel.

723
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:40,698
It's always something.

724
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:43,868
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

725
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:45,670
Okay.

726
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,505
Pull over.

727
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:17,769
Okay, let's see.

728
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:19,637
Regular unleaded.

729
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:20,872
Ooh. Wow.

730
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:22,340
It is expensive, no?

731
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,177
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

732
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:28,413
"Card not read."

733
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:32,750
- Oh, come on.
- Did you pull it out rapidly?

734
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,186
Yes, yes, very rapidly.

735
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:45,763
Ay, get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

736
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:50,902
Hey, you, your stupid machine
won't read my card.

737
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:52,737
Did you remove it rapidly?

738
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:53,938
Yes.

739
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,207
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.

740
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:58,342
You should probably try again.

741
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:01,612
I don't have time for this!

742
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,247
Whoa!

743
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:07,385
I'm trying to destroy
my archnemesis.

744
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:10,488
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

745
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:13,224
Please don't hurt me.

746
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,359
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

747
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:18,696
Wha...

748
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,405
Oh, look at you.

749
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:30,042
Much better.

750
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:31,943
Now, get me a purple slushy!

751
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:35,880
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know.

752
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,049
So there.

753
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:38,449
I know I'm so bad.

754
00:45:44,056 --> 00:45:48,160
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

755
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,596
This was Lucky's
favorite cereal.

756
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:55,700
You don't think
he'll forget me, do you?

757
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,736
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

758
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,539
You play with Lucky
and-and dress him up.

759
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,508
And you guys have your podcast.

760
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:07,246
There is no way in this world
he could ever forget

761
00:46:07,345 --> 00:46:09,680
his best friend.

762
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:11,682
Thanks, Mom.

763
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:13,085
Oh, look it!

764
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:16,021
This one has extra marshmallows!

765
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,588
Double Frosted Choco Clusters.

766
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:20,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go with those.

767
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:22,060
All right, what else do we need?

768
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:25,730
Oh, no.

769
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,432
Nobody see. Nobody notice.
Nobody notice.

770
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,004
What's wrong?

771
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:36,208
Oh, nothing. Just, uh...

772
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:39,077
ooh, stretching
before we hit the aisles.

773
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:42,380
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

774
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,549
Probably didn't know that.

775
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:49,554
Okay, all stretched.
Let's go. Quickly.

776
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,256
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

777
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:52,723
Okay. Coast is clear.

778
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:00,165
You!

779
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:03,768
You did this to me!

780
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:04,902
You fraud.

781
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:06,771
Come on, girls.
Clean up on aisle nine!

782
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,906
I've always wanted to say that.

783
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:10,741
Just hide over here.

784
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,312
What does that lady want?

785
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,247
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

786
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:19,550
Lady!

787
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,186
Come on, let's go.

788
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:23,055
- Faster.
- Aah! -Whoa!

789
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:24,755
You're no hairdresser!

790
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:27,658
I'm onto you!

791
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:29,994
- Get back here!
- Got to get out of here.

792
00:47:46,611 --> 00:47:48,779
Okay.

793
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:56,288
Come back here!

794
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,457
Whoa!

795
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,996
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

796
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,099
- You can't just...
- Open! Open!

797
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,833
Open!

798
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:16,908
Whoa!

799
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:18,210
Let's go.

800
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,949
Stop! Come here, you!

801
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:29,187
No!

802
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,024
That was a close one.

803
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:34,425
Always a fun time
when you go shopping with Mom.

804
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,395
- Yeah!
- Best shopping trip ever!

805
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:38,796
I feel so alive!

806
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,595
Perfecto.

807
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:13,531
Poppy?

808
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:16,134
Poppy!

809
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:21,173
I don't see her, Junior.

810
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:22,773
Look up, genius.

811
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:24,242
You're late.

812
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,645
How do I get up there?

813
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,181
Use the trampoline.

814
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:37,588
Here we go.

815
00:49:45,397 --> 00:49:47,032
Whoa! Aah!

816
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:06,284
It is I,

817
00:50:06,385 --> 00:50:08,619
Poppy Prescott,

818
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:10,921
villainess.

819
00:50:11,023 --> 00:50:12,391
Have a seat, Gru.

820
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,493
All right, I'll sit...

821
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:17,828
Okay. Why am I here?

822
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:22,600
Because, like you,
I was born to be bad.

823
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,934
And now...

824
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:27,605
it's time to discuss
our big heist.

825
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:29,241
"Heist."

826
00:50:29,341 --> 00:50:31,076
Please, you're just a child.

827
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,280
All great villains start young.

828
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,350
Didn't you steal the
Crown Jewels when you were 12?

829
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:40,851
I was a lot younger than that.

830
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,753
And no offense,
but you're not me.

831
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:47,092
Oh, I plan on being
a lot better than you.

832
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,494
Check this out.

833
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,896
Hey, is that my old school?

834
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,331
Bingo.

835
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:57,502
Which I have expertly modeled
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

836
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,372
And it's where
we are going to steal...

837
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:03,141
the school mascot.

838
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:05,143
You want to steal Lenny?

839
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:06,577
Exactly.

840
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:09,414
Lycee Pas Bon has always been
my dream school,

841
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:10,781
and this heist
will look so great

842
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,683
on my villain transcripts.

843
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:14,752
That is a terrible idea.

844
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,721
Have you ever even seen
a honey badger?

845
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:20,058
They are vicious
little monsters.

846
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:24,196
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

847
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:26,465
Honey badger don't care.

848
00:51:26,565 --> 00:51:28,766
No way. No way am I helping you.

849
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,136
Well, that's the thing
with blackmail.

850
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,039
You kind of have no choice.

851
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:50,555
Come here. Come here!

852
00:52:07,872 --> 00:52:09,773
Tim.

853
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:11,409
Tim, uh, tu le do it.

854
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,612
- Go, go, go.
- P-P-Porque meo?

855
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:17,015
Chihuahua.

856
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:24,556
Bas enough!

857
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:26,591
No! Tu le stronga.

858
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,193
Tu le forta.

859
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:29,361
Tu le besta!

860
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:31,630
Les salami!

861
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:33,565
Les salami!

862
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:36,268
Aah! Suppository!

863
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,608
Hey! Police!

864
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,177
No problemo.

865
00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:54,486
Ooh. Uh...

866
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:57,088
{\an8}Piña colada.

867
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:04,695
Help!

868
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:08,966
Please, can you help me?

869
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:11,269
Oh, si, si.

870
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:19,377
Hey. All is goot.

871
00:53:19,477 --> 00:53:20,579
Ciao!

872
00:53:23,648 --> 00:53:25,283
Smudge, Smudge, come down.

873
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:26,784
Hey!

874
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,024
Les gato.

875
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:35,293
Thank you. Thank you.

876
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:38,263
Ooh, smoocha.

877
00:53:50,342 --> 00:53:51,676
Help!

878
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,412
Bazooka!

879
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:20,605
Hey, hey. Stoppa. Stoppa.

880
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:22,374
Muy risky. Lemme do it.

881
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:34,319
Ciao, bellos!

882
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,059
There they are.
Those guys crushed my car.

883
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,926
They destroyed the coffee shop!

884
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:44,195
Yeah, get out of here!

885
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:45,764
They're ruining everything.

886
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:47,032
I'm sick of superheroes.

887
00:54:47,132 --> 00:54:48,866
- Yeah.
- Let's get 'em.

888
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:54,472
Get in.

889
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,512
Gentlemen...

890
00:55:00,612 --> 00:55:02,913
our experiment has failed.

891
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:05,816
You are officially
going to be retired.

892
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,786
Yeah! Retirement!

893
00:55:07,885 --> 00:55:10,121
Uh, uh, no?

894
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:27,272
Whoa. There it is.

895
00:55:34,379 --> 00:55:35,580
The castle.

896
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,015
The gargoyles.

897
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:39,417
- I can't believe I'm
really here. -

898
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,692
Okay.

899
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:51,096
Voilà.

900
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:53,331
Okay, let's get this over with.

901
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:55,899
- Ron, hand me my gear.
- Voilà.

902
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,036
- Keep a close eye on him.
- Okay.

903
00:55:58,136 --> 00:55:59,437
If you need anything,
I brought formula...

904
00:55:59,537 --> 00:56:01,740
- Uh-huh. Formula. Diapers.
- ...extra diapers,

905
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,006
- his favorite Binky.
- Come on.

906
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:04,975
Let's go, let's go.

907
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,221
And now we cut
through the glass with my...

908
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:17,789
Diapers?

909
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:18,956
What?

910
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:20,458
You've got to be kidding
with me.

911
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:25,697
Hey, guys. Guys.

912
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:27,165
Guys? Guys.

913
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:29,868
Guys, where is the other bag,
with my gear?

914
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,669
Ah, in le balloon.

915
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:34,938
Oops.

916
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,576
What? How...

917
00:56:40,578 --> 00:56:43,515
All right, all right.
Let's see what I got in here.

918
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:44,982
Uh... come on.

919
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:46,684
Come on, come on, come on.

920
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:48,453
Aha.

921
00:56:54,426 --> 00:56:56,161
Thank you.

922
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:00,465
Easy peasy.

923
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,951
That's Mr. Friendly.

924
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:26,591
No, no, no, no, no!

925
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,577
Ha, ha, ha.

926
00:57:50,348 --> 00:57:52,417
That's Dr. Destructo.

927
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,018
He was just a kid.

928
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:56,554
And there's Killer Driller's
original helmet.

929
00:57:56,654 --> 00:57:59,224
Come on. Stay focused.

930
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:09,701
Diaper.

931
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:26,184
I need something like...

932
00:58:26,284 --> 00:58:28,653
- something that I can...
- How about this?

933
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:30,555
Nice.

934
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:35,360
Yes!

935
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,831
We're in.

936
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:40,932
Wait.

937
00:58:41,032 --> 00:58:42,634
No, no, no, no, no.

938
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:43,968
Baby powder.

939
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:46,104
{\an8}Ah, si, si. Yeah.

940
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:52,210
Whoa.

941
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,579
You know, the most important
part of a heist

942
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,248
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

943
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,716
Le baby!

944
00:58:58,816 --> 00:59:00,752
La la! Tiramisu!

945
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:02,487
No, no! Le baby! Komay le!

946
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,155
No. Junior.

947
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:05,823
Junior, come back here.

948
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:10,795
So, what's your plan now?

949
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:12,931
I am dealing with it.

950
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:17,669
Don't touch anything.

951
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:21,472
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

952
00:59:22,774 --> 00:59:24,576
Good job, Junior.

953
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:26,744
Way to go.

954
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:31,050
Aw, he's having fun.

955
00:59:31,149 --> 00:59:32,917
Eh, too much fun.

956
00:59:34,385 --> 00:59:36,187
- Ah, stoppa.
- Blah, blah, blah.

957
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:40,391
Please, Junior, Daddy needs
to steal a honey badger.

958
00:59:43,728 --> 00:59:45,330
Whew. Okay.

959
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,833
I know they keep Lenny here
at night.

960
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:51,135
And if memory serves,

961
00:59:51,235 --> 00:59:54,739
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

962
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:56,240
Ah. Aha.

963
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,043
Yes.

964
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:02,280
Ooh.

965
01:00:11,056 --> 01:00:12,590
I'll hit him with this.

966
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,326
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

967
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:17,528
That fuzzy demon will sleep
like a baby the whole...

968
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,004
Okay, he's still asleep.

969
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,717
I tranked myself.

970
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:47,759
Hey! Hey!

971
01:00:50,129 --> 01:00:52,230
Gru, what do we do?

972
01:00:53,098 --> 01:00:54,499
No!

973
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,670
Oh, no!

974
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,571
I ruined our heist.

975
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:05,443
What? Who dares?

976
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:13,018
Intruders!

977
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:17,355
Intruders!

978
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:30,601
Wake up!

979
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:33,538
No!

980
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:40,611
What?

981
01:01:46,718 --> 01:01:48,087
Aw.

982
01:01:48,187 --> 01:01:49,353
Aw.

983
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:52,256
No. Nope.

984
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:57,261
Come on. We have to go.

985
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:06,671
Intruders, you messed
with the wrong principal.

986
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:09,507
Here we go.
Come on. Come on.

987
01:02:15,513 --> 01:02:17,281
Go, go, go!

988
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:22,221
Come on! Come on!

989
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,756
Ooh, you won't get away
with this.

990
01:02:47,478 --> 01:02:49,781
Prepare to feel the wrath
of Übelschlecht.

991
01:02:53,918 --> 01:02:55,286
Diaper rash cream.

992
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:58,656
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

993
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:01,826
Oh, dear.

994
01:03:04,428 --> 01:03:05,963
Get back here, you!

995
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:08,633
I want my Lenny!

996
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:14,173
How are we getting out of here?

997
01:03:14,273 --> 01:03:16,074
Follow me.

998
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,642
Get in.

999
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:21,979
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1000
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:26,684
Mr. Friendly!

1001
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:29,188
Whoa!

1002
01:03:49,274 --> 01:03:50,842
I have to say,

1003
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:54,912
that was, without a doubt,
the coolest night of my life.

1004
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:57,882
I can't believe
we actually pulled that off.

1005
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:01,619
Not gonna lie,
that was pretty fun.

1006
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:04,922
{\an8}Scusa. Scusa.

1007
01:04:05,023 --> 01:04:06,191
{\an8}Thanks, Ron.

1008
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:12,264
And thank you for everything.

1009
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:14,498
Oh, and hey, don't worry.

1010
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:18,002
Your secret is safe with me, partner.

1011
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:19,304
Thanks.

1012
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:21,439
Good night.

1013
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:26,178
Your dada did pretty good,
huh, Junior?

1014
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:37,356
Hello, Maxime.

1015
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:39,624
How's my favorite student?

1016
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:41,392
You know, I think you and I

1017
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:43,661
might be looking
for the same person,

1018
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:47,431
and I know exactly where he is.

1019
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:57,209
Thank you,
Principal Übelschlecht.

1020
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:59,010
We got him!

1021
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:01,545
Valentina, to Mayflower!

1022
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:03,181
With pleasure.

1023
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:11,089
Ah. Here we go.

1024
01:05:12,324 --> 01:05:13,858
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1025
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:16,161
It's all coming back to me.

1026
01:05:18,263 --> 01:05:19,864
Oops. Oh.

1027
01:05:19,964 --> 01:05:21,300
Okay.

1028
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,268
See you later.

1029
01:05:23,368 --> 01:05:24,502
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

1030
01:05:24,602 --> 01:05:25,836
Have fun at the club.

1031
01:05:25,937 --> 01:05:28,140
Make good choices.

1032
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,142
- Bye, guys.
- Goodbye.

1033
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:31,343
Bye!

1034
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:32,977
Hey, Cunninghams.

1035
01:05:33,078 --> 01:05:34,879
Um, hey, Poppy.

1036
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:36,714
I heard our parents
are having a playdate--

1037
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:38,616
which is adorable, by the way--

1038
01:05:38,716 --> 01:05:41,320
and I thought you might
want to hang out.

1039
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,487
Oh. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1040
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:46,258
{\an8}Let's get this party started,
people!

1041
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:48,427
I like her.

1042
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:50,429
Yeah, most people do.

1043
01:05:50,528 --> 01:05:52,730
Sweet.

1044
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,400
So, have you guys ever seen
a honey badger?

1045
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:05,776
Whoa, okay. These guys
aren't messing around.

1046
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:08,512
There are my favorite
new neighbors.

1047
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:11,615
- Hi.
- I'm loving this whole vibe.

1048
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:13,651
You two look like
a couple of pros.

1049
01:06:15,786 --> 01:06:17,955
Yeah, but we're not.

1050
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:20,658
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

1051
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:23,295
and we are hitting
the clubhouse.

1052
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:26,264
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

1053
01:06:33,138 --> 01:06:34,239
Over here, Chet.

1054
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:36,041
Hello.

1055
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:37,908
Okay.

1056
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:40,445
Skip, Chip, Chet.
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1057
01:06:40,544 --> 01:06:41,679
Hey there, fellas.

1058
01:06:41,779 --> 01:06:43,415
- Hello.
- How are you doing, Chet?

1059
01:06:43,514 --> 01:06:44,483
Okay.

1060
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:49,321
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1061
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:51,089
Right?

1062
01:06:53,758 --> 01:06:57,229
Oh, I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1063
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:58,863
Okay.

1064
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:11,008
What the...

1065
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:19,617
Okay. Let's do this.

1066
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:26,058
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

1067
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,960
{\an8}Okay, okay.

1068
01:07:30,062 --> 01:07:31,562
{\an8}Better?

1069
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:38,370
What?

1070
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,039
That doesn't count.

1071
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:42,807
And... oh! What?

1072
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,410
You can't just...

1073
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,844
This is ridiculous!

1074
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:03,994
Thanks, Ron.

1075
01:08:04,096 --> 01:08:05,230
Hey, no! Oh, no!

1076
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:09,468
Come and get it.

1077
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:11,635
- Oh, it's so cute.
- Whoa.

1078
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:14,139
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1079
01:08:15,507 --> 01:08:17,342
I'll get it.

1080
01:08:25,816 --> 01:08:28,320
Well, hello, little one.

1081
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,088
Is your daddy home?

1082
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:33,924
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1083
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,760
Oh. I'm not a stranger.

1084
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:39,997
Well, you look strange to me.

1085
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,300
Who is it?

1086
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,934
I don't know.

1087
01:08:44,035 --> 01:08:48,206
But she's old
and smells like pickles.

1088
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,045
Okay, I'm coming.

1089
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:58,649
Oh, no. Um...

1090
01:08:58,749 --> 01:09:01,086
I'll be right back.

1091
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:04,489
Can I help you?

1092
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:06,358
Well, I hope so.

1093
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,859
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1094
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:11,762
Well, he's not here, so...

1095
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:14,332
Oh, that's all right.

1096
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:16,934
I'll wait.

1097
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,506
Huh? What? No!

1098
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,410
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1099
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,445
Um...

1100
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,657
Needless to say, Perry and I
are no longer welcome

1101
01:09:38,756 --> 01:09:40,525
on the island of O'ahu.

1102
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,661
True story.

1103
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,663
Honey.

1104
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:46,131
- Oh, thank goodness.
- It's the children.

1105
01:09:46,231 --> 01:09:48,799
We have to go now.

1106
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:52,002
Thanks. Bye.

1107
01:09:52,103 --> 01:09:53,871
- Our cover's blown.
- What?

1108
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:55,773
- Call Silas.
- Oh, no.

1109
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,877
Gru's been compromised.

1110
01:10:33,978 --> 01:10:35,746
This is an emergency, people.

1111
01:10:35,846 --> 01:10:37,982
Retirement is officially over.

1112
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:40,951
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1113
01:10:49,427 --> 01:10:51,029
Pomodoro!

1114
01:10:59,137 --> 01:11:00,572
Pomodoro!

1115
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:09,047
Shooshta, shooshta,
shooshta, shooshta,

1116
01:11:09,147 --> 01:11:11,516
shooshta, shooshta, shooshta!

1117
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,320
Hey.

1118
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,322
Bello, busy bee.

1119
01:11:17,422 --> 01:11:19,057
Aw.

1120
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:22,560
Pomodoro!

1121
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,400
Yee-haw!

1122
01:11:29,668 --> 01:11:31,202
Pomodoro!

1123
01:11:33,538 --> 01:11:34,639
Pomodoro!

1124
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,341
Yee-haw!

1125
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:38,343
Yippa, yippa!

1126
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:43,348
Whoa.

1127
01:11:43,448 --> 01:11:44,549
Yeah!

1128
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:58,430
So, your father
has been naughty.

1129
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,931
Very naughty.

1130
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,769
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1131
01:12:09,641 --> 01:12:11,643
Principal Übelschlecht?

1132
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:15,547
Ooh. I know you took my Lenny.

1133
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,415
Now, hand him over!

1134
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:18,717
Ow. That...

1135
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:21,019
- Actually very funny story.
- Zip it!

1136
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:22,654
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

1137
01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:23,887
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

1138
01:12:23,987 --> 01:12:25,490
Let's go, tough guy.

1139
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,758
Okay.

1140
01:12:26,857 --> 01:12:28,727
I'm not going to fight
an old lady.

1141
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:29,993
Oh, yeah?

1142
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,629
Well, I'm gonna give you
a whupping

1143
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,264
for the history books.

1144
01:12:33,365 --> 01:12:34,799
Whoa, whoa!

1145
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:38,936
Take that!

1146
01:12:42,807 --> 01:12:44,843
{\an8}Yeah, go!

1147
01:12:44,942 --> 01:12:47,010
Girls, look out! Over here!

1148
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,747
- Everyone, get down!
- Gru!

1149
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:52,684
Hey, back off, lady.

1150
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:05,296
Stop it!

1151
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:06,297
Let him go!

1152
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:08,400
Take that!

1153
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:17,876
Now we have to get in there

1154
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:19,144
and find that baby.

1155
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:20,845
What?

1156
01:13:24,682 --> 01:13:25,850
Oh! Jackpot, huh?

1157
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:27,051
Ay, Maxime.

1158
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,919
This is too easy.

1159
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,723
Come here, little baby.

1160
01:13:31,823 --> 01:13:33,024
Come to Maxime.

1161
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:35,160
Yes. Coochie-coochie...

1162
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,095
Ay, Maxime.

1163
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:38,897
You little...

1164
01:13:38,996 --> 01:13:41,466
You are in big trouble.

1165
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:44,135
Gotcha!

1166
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,881
Wait. Where's the baby?

1167
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,284
Where's the baby?!

1168
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:00,552
Junior?

1169
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:05,723
Lucy!

1170
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:06,858
Go after the baby.

1171
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:10,829
Maxime.

1172
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:12,797
Say <i>au revoir,</i> Gru.

1173
01:14:12,897 --> 01:14:14,132
Oh, and don't worry.

1174
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:16,935
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1175
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,269
Right? Look at him.

1176
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:20,738
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

1177
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:22,507
Junior!

1178
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:26,311
No!

1179
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:29,747
Whoa!

1180
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:31,216
Get in.

1181
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:34,319
We've got a baby to save.

1182
01:14:40,492 --> 01:14:43,561
We got him!

1183
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:47,065
Oh, who is ready to become
a little roach?

1184
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:49,033
Ow! Let go!

1185
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:50,969
Ow! Those are very sensitive.

1186
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,003
Aah! You squirmy little...

1187
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:57,141
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

1188
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,744
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1189
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:04,983
Valentina, bring me
the Roachification Ray.

1190
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,121
There they are.

1191
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:13,892
I'm on it.

1192
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:16,427
Here we go!

1193
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:24,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1194
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:32,644
What's that?

1195
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:34,846
Hello.

1196
01:15:34,946 --> 01:15:36,714
Gru!

1197
01:15:36,814 --> 01:15:39,150
Get me closer.

1198
01:15:41,085 --> 01:15:42,687
Almost there.

1199
01:15:44,188 --> 01:15:46,224
Take them out!

1200
01:15:57,268 --> 01:15:59,470
You're doing great!

1201
01:16:04,876 --> 01:16:07,145
Go get 'em, partner.

1202
01:16:23,127 --> 01:16:25,496
Ay! I can't see!

1203
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:42,614
Junior.

1204
01:16:43,314 --> 01:16:45,516
Don't worry, Gru.

1205
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:47,151
The baby is fine.

1206
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:48,920
See for yourself.

1207
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,026
Oh, Junior.

1208
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,860
And now he belongs to me.

1209
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,996
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr.?

1210
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,400
Together, we will wreak havoc,
cause mayhem

1211
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,802
and have so much fun
doing it, huh?

1212
01:17:06,537 --> 01:17:09,074
And best of all, he hates you!

1213
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:10,675
He really does.

1214
01:17:10,775 --> 01:17:12,710
Let my son go.

1215
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,178
No, I don't think so.

1216
01:17:14,278 --> 01:17:17,682
The fun is just about
to start, huh?

1217
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:30,095
Oh, look at what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1218
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:59,158
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1219
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,060
Now, give me my son.

1220
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,529
I told you, he is my son now.

1221
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:17,142
Watch your step, Gru.

1222
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:18,676
It's a doozy!

1223
01:18:19,544 --> 01:18:21,679
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1224
01:18:28,753 --> 01:18:30,022
Let go!

1225
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:43,367
This ends now!

1226
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,204
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1227
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,911
It's okay, Junior.

1228
01:18:54,011 --> 01:18:56,547
Dada loves you.

1229
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,773
Get back here.

1230
01:19:21,873 --> 01:19:23,075
Bad baby.

1231
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,777
Get off me, you demon!

1232
01:19:25,877 --> 01:19:28,046
You are going to feel
the wrath of...

1233
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:41,160
Whoa.

1234
01:19:52,104 --> 01:19:54,173
See? Not a scratch.

1235
01:19:54,273 --> 01:19:56,175
Huh? Wha...?

1236
01:19:56,275 --> 01:19:58,976
Salami!

1237
01:20:00,878 --> 01:20:02,446
Pastrami!

1238
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:06,417
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1239
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:08,686
Prosciutto!

1240
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,290
- What?
- Prosciutto!

1241
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,025
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

1242
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,159
Gross.

1243
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,464
Nice try. When I...

1244
01:20:23,467 --> 01:20:26,138
{\an8}Antipasti.

1245
01:20:32,777 --> 01:20:34,345
- Gru! -Oh, Gru!
- You're here!

1246
01:20:34,445 --> 01:20:36,948
Junior!

1247
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:41,220
Yes!

1248
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,553
- Yay!
- Holy cow!

1249
01:20:42,653 --> 01:20:44,289
- Are you guys okay?
- That was insane!

1250
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,895
Dada.

1251
01:20:54,866 --> 01:20:56,767
Aw.

1252
01:20:56,868 --> 01:20:58,603
Aw. My boys.

1253
01:20:58,703 --> 01:21:00,404
Dada.

1254
01:21:00,504 --> 01:21:02,540
You know something,
today has been

1255
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,643
a real roller coaster
of emotion.

1256
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:11,083
Uh, Gru?

1257
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:13,451
Can we go back home now?

1258
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:19,824
All right. There you go.

1259
01:21:19,924 --> 01:21:22,094
Yay!

1260
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:23,494
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1261
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:25,496
Good as new.

1262
01:21:25,596 --> 01:21:28,367
No job too small or too mad.

1263
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,069
Bye, then.

1264
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:32,904
Bye.

1265
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:42,413
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1266
01:21:44,216 --> 01:21:45,284
Agnes!

1267
01:21:45,384 --> 01:21:47,818
Someone's here to see you!

1268
01:21:54,592 --> 01:21:56,894
Lucky?

1269
01:22:01,066 --> 01:22:02,267
Lucky!

1270
01:22:05,404 --> 01:22:07,139
Did you practice your tricks?

1271
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:10,108
Okay, play dead.

1272
01:22:14,645 --> 01:22:16,281
Yay!

1273
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:18,849
Ah, that was... disturbing.

1274
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:20,551
- Yeah, little bit.
- Lucky!

1275
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,058
Hey, I'll, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1276
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:27,491
- Oh. Okay.
- Mwah.

1277
01:22:27,591 --> 01:22:29,794
There's something
I need to take care of.

1278
01:22:29,894 --> 01:22:31,029
Mwah.

1279
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:32,264
See you later, buddy.

1280
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,497
Love you, honey.

1281
01:22:33,597 --> 01:22:35,967
Da-da-da.

1282
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,774
How you doing, Maxime?

1283
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:46,345
What are you doing here, Gru?

1284
01:22:46,445 --> 01:22:48,213
You came to gloat, no?

1285
01:22:48,313 --> 01:22:49,647
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just...

1286
01:22:49,747 --> 01:22:52,150
I wanted to get something
off my chest.

1287
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,718
And it concerns

1288
01:22:53,818 --> 01:22:56,421
the ninth grade talent show.

1289
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,425
Well, actually...

1290
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:03,894
- I did steal your song.
- What?

1291
01:23:03,995 --> 01:23:05,163
I knew it!

1292
01:23:05,263 --> 01:23:06,497
I knew there was no coincidence.

1293
01:23:06,597 --> 01:23:08,166
You little liar!

1294
01:23:09,934 --> 01:23:11,036
Well?

1295
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:12,371
Well, what?

1296
01:23:12,471 --> 01:23:13,771
- Well, where's my apology?
- Apol...

1297
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:15,407
What are you talking about?

1298
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:17,209
I just apologized.

1299
01:23:17,309 --> 01:23:18,477
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1300
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:20,379
No, that was no apology.

1301
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,513
You just wanted to rub it in.

1302
01:23:22,613 --> 01:23:25,450
I can't believe
you stole my song.

1303
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:27,452
Hey, I only did that
to get back at you

1304
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:29,354
for pantsing me
at the homecoming dance.

1305
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:31,390
Besides,

1306
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,025
you could've gone on after me.

1307
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:36,261
It is not my fault
that you were afraid.

1308
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:39,264
Afraid because I killed it!

1309
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:40,698
Afraid? Ha!

1310
01:23:40,798 --> 01:23:43,235
I could outsing you
any day of the week

1311
01:23:43,335 --> 01:23:44,802
and all day Sunday.

1312
01:23:44,902 --> 01:23:47,472
I'd like to see that.

1313
01:23:47,571 --> 01:23:49,640
Anytime, anyplace.

1314
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:51,742
You name it, <i>mon ami.</i>

1315
01:24:02,421 --> 01:24:04,523
Oh, yeah.

1316
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:08,692
Aah!

1317
01:24:12,164 --> 01:24:13,265
Aah!

1318
01:24:16,535 --> 01:24:17,668
Oh, come on!

1319
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:35,586
- Yes!
- Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1320
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:45,063
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

1321
01:25:54,832 --> 01:25:56,800
Woo-hoo!

1322
01:26:14,186 --> 01:26:17,088
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1323
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:25,063
Bello?

1324
01:26:26,364 --> 01:26:28,500
Bello!

1325
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,296
<i>Oh, strudel.</i>

1326
01:27:50,482 --> 01:27:51,815
Uh, whoops.

1327
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:41,865
Bello.

1328
01:28:53,778 --> 01:28:55,879
Ooh.

1329
01:31:09,948 --> 01:31:11,916
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1330
01:31:12,016 --> 01:31:13,485
Blah, blah, blah.

1331
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:16,921
Ooh-la-la.

1332
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,575
Hey-hey! Bello!
