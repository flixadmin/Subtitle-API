1
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,333
Oi!

2
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,252
Mind out.

3
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,505
Move!

4
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,397
Look, on the west wall!

5
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,025
Get down to the crypt!

6
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,237
Just hold.

7
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,531
We'll take him.

8
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,454
Come on, help the lads!

9
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,538
Yes, my lady.

10
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,625
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,919
- Come on.
- Close the gate!

12
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,837
That's it.

13
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You took your time.

14
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,376
Do you speak their tongue?

15
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,382
Tell them to lift their swords.

16
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,029
Valar Morghulis.

17
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,572
Valar Dohaeris.

18
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,047
Open the gate!

19
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,381
Open the gate!

20
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,549
Open the gate!

21
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,359
Come. Come on.

22
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,653
Easy.

23
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,099
There's no need to execute me,
Ser Davos.

24
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,059
I'll be dead before the dawn.

25
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,849
<font color="#ffff00">Cease fire!</font>

26
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,493
The Night King is coming.

27
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,246
The dead are already here.

28
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,625
Stand your ground!

29
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,569
Get down to the crypt.

30
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,155
I'm not abandoning my people.

31
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,282
Take this and go.

32
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,954
I don't know how to use it.

33
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,540
Stick them with the pointy end.

34
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,753
Edd!

35
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,464
Edd!

36
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,818
Sam, get up!

37
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,075
Oh, God. Sam.

38
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,768
Fall back! Fall back!

39
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,105
Fall back!

40
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,315
Come on!

41
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,026
Open the gate!

42
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,986
Open the gate!

43
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,154
Let us in!

44
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,866
Open the gate!

45
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,451
Open the gate!

46
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,372
Keep moving!

47
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,460
Come on!

48
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,466
- Keep moving, fast.
- To your posts.

49
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,426
- Go!
- Keep moving!

50
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,097
Come on, run!

51
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,181
Keep moving!

52
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,857
<font color="#ffff00">Protect the retreat!</font>

53
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,571
<font color="#ffff00">Stand your ground!</font>

54
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,946
Dany!

55
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,767
Grab your weapon now!

56
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,435
Guard the barricades!

57
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,729
Through that pass!

58
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,439
Hey! Hey! Hey!

59
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,774
Close up the gaps!

60
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,777
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

61
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,779
Get in! Get in!

62
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,572
Get in! Come on!

63
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,400
Move!

64
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,933
<font color="#ffff00">Retreat!</font>

65
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,893
<font color="#ffff00">Retreat!</font>

66
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,478
- Come on!
- Come on!

67
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,980
- Come on!
- Come on!

68
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,483
Protect the gate!

69
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,569
Protect the gate!

70
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,071
They're coming! Come on!

71
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,781
Fall back!

72
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,261
Light the trench!

73
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,888
Light the trench!

74
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,141
- Wait!
- Light the trench!

75
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,255
She can't see us.

76
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,008
Light the trenches!

77
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,733
With a torch, light the trenches!

78
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,111
- Right there.
- Torch it!

79
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,780
Light the trenches!

80
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,737
Clegane.

81
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,621
You must try not to worry yourself.

82
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,095
At least we're already in a crypt.

83
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,018
If we were up there,

84
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,022
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

85
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,400
Something that makes a difference.

86
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,445
What?

87
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,448
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

88
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,617
- And got your face cut in half.
- And it made a difference.

89
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,580
If I was out there right now...

90
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,748
You'd die.

91
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,918
There's nothing you can do.

92
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,467
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

93
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,053
to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

94
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,181
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

95
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,974
Witty remarks won't make a difference.

96
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,438
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

97
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,067
It's the truth.

98
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,653
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

99
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,157
look the truth in the face.

100
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,373
Maybe we should have stayed married.

101
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,750
You were the best of them.

102
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,170
What a terrifying thought.

103
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,595
It wouldn't work between us.

104
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,056
Why not?

105
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,058
The Dragon Queen.

106
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,230
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

107
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,065
Yes.

108
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,111
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

109
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,822
We'd all be dead already.

110
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,345
They lit the trench.

111
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,152
Bran...

112
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,576
I just want you to know...

113
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,622
I wish...

114
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,417
The things I did...

115
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,295
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

116
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,756
Where you belong.

117
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,051
Home.

118
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,564
I'm going to go now.

119
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,735
Go where?

120
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,845
Man the walls!

121
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,681
Man the walls!

122
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,149
Man the wall!

123
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,568
Man the walls!

124
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,529
Come on!

125
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,365
Get out there! Get moving!

126
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,243
Come on. Come on! Come on!

127
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,332
Go, go, go!

128
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,042
Come on!

129
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,209
They're against the wall!

130
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,340
Get more men up here!

131
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,721
- Fill the gaps, quickly!
- Get in there!

132
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,056
They're climbing the walls!

133
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,725
- Relieve the archers!
- Relieve the archers!

134
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,187
Archers on top!

135
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,940
- Move up!
- Go, go! Come here!

136
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,650
- Come on!
- Move back!

137
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,402
- Stand away!
- Go on, go on. Go! Go.

138
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,821
- Step back.
- All the way, archers!

139
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,213
Hold the wall!

140
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,673
The wall, they're coming up!

141
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,009
- Hold the wall!
- Hold the wall!

142
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,261
Draw!

143
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,120
Come on!

144
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,589
They're coming up!

145
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,727
Look out!

146
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,994
Clegane!

147
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,371
Clegane!

148
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,819
Clegane!

149
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,612
Clegane, we need you!

150
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,656
You can't give up on us.

151
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,908
Fuck off! We can't beat them.

152
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,285
Don't you see that, you stupid whore?

153
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,121
We're fighting Death!

154
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,539
They can't beat Death.

155
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,753
Tell her that.

156
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,998
Ahhh!

157
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,542
Open the door!

158
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,713
Open the door!

159
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,173
- Come on!
- Open the door!

160
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,841
Open the door!

161
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,638
Please!

162
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,891
Open it!

163
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,821
Come on! Go!

164
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,074
- Come on!
- Run!

165
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,518
We've gotta go!

166
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,499
The Lord brought him back
for a purpose.

167
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,673
Now that purpose has been served.

168
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,096
I know you.

169
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:08,811
And I know you.

170
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,320
You said we'd meet again.

171
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,364
And here we are.

172
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,658
At the end of the world.

173
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,745
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

174
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,998
You were right about that too.

175
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,209
Brown eyes...

176
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,294
green eyes...

177
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,881
and blue eyes.

178
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,987
What do we say to the God of Death?

179
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,325
Not today.

180
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,852
Here they come!

181
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,774
Steady, lads.

182
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,109
Steady now.

183
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,322
Make every shot count.

184
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,874
Over there!

185
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,170
There!

186
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,920
Get off.

187
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,101
Dracarys.

188
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,678
Come on! Come on!

189
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,058
No! No, no, no!

190
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,360
- Bran!
- Go!

191
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,470
Jorah!

192
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,137
Theon.

193
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,358
You're a good man.

194
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:26,449
Thank you.

195
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,857
I'm hurt.
