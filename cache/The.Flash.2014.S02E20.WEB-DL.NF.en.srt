outrun The Flash.

No. No lightning.
It's a hologram, remember?

But so far, so good!

32

I mean, I figured if they could get
Tupac rapping again at a concert,

33
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,610
we could definitely get The Flash
running around Central City.

38
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,455

this is as good an idea as any.

{\an8}Actually, I beg to differ.

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,294
{\an8}I think a better idea, instead of playing
hoodlums and holograms,

41
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,629
{\an8}would be to rebuild
the particle accelerator

that's what you keep saying.

{\an8}Look at what that explosion did
to this city.

{\an8}Not to mention, the last time
we tried something like that,

47

{\an8}we blew a hole in the universe and
created, like, 50 portals to your Earth.

{\an8}And even if you could contain it,

55
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,372
{\an8}I thought you said that Barry couldn't
tap into the Speed Force anymore.

56

Why would he bring her here?

166

To show power.

167
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,053
It's exactly what he did on my Earth.

-First thing he did was murder people.

170

then recruited
every meta-human he could find.

171
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,480
And those that disobeyed, he killed, too.

172
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,232
Where are the police now?

173
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,775
Outside the precinct.

174
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,570
He'll kill them, Joe. He'll kill them all.

175
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,071
Not with Caitlin with him.

Joe, you need to
get those guys out of there.

179
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,663
What if they set up at Jitters?

180
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,625
It's a good idea.
It's just a block away from the precinct.

He will do
the exact same thing here, Barry.

195

Then why are you keeping me here?

that I should come and see you.

-He looks like...
-Now!

313
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,691
God, I knew there was something wrong!

314
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:09,028
Every time I see you, we get attacked by
lunatics with crazy weapons!

-(METAL CLANKING)
-(GLASS SHATTERING)

316
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,701
Come on, he's gonna
blast us with that thing!

317
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:16,993
CISCO: No, he's not.

318
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,789
Go, go!

319
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,004
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

320
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,551
You wanna tell me exactly what
you've gotten us into this time?

321
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,262
HARRISON: <i>He calls himself Rupture.</i>

322
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,014
Another meta-human under
Zoom's control from my Earth.

323
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,351
Great, so he's bringing
more of his friends over.

324
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
It's what I told you that he would do.

325
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,397
Okay, well,
Zoom must've lied to fake Dante

326
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,898
and told him I was the one
who killed Reverb,

327
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,484
'cause dude wants me dead.

328
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,985
We gotta do something.

329
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,445
What else do you know about him?

330
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,989
He gets his power
from that scythe he wields.

331
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,408
Thing's legit, too.
It almost took half the van with him.

332
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,784
All right, then that's what we need to do.

333
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,911
We need to figure out a way
to get it away from him.

334
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,080
Right. (SIGHS)

335
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,665
Okay. All right, I'm sure
I can come up with something.

336
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,127
I just have to figure out a way
to not tell Dante

337
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,462
why this psychopath looks
exactly like him.

338
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,009
You know what you need to do.

339
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:16,970
(SIGHS)

340
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,555
I need a minute.

341
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,319
IRIS: Hey.

00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,530
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

343
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,617
This should be an easy decision. (SCOFFS)

344
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,452
Why isn't it? (SIGHING)

345
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,915
I mean, it's not like you're picking out
what sweater you're going to wear.

346
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
Getting hit by another
particle accelerator explosion?

347
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,628
I mean, come on.

348
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,505
What if something goes wrong? What if...

349
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,927
I thought bringing my dad here
would make this easier.

350
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,304
(CHUCKLES)

351

<i>It's just made it a lot harder.</i>

352
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,266
Yeah, I can understand
him not wanting you to do it.

353
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,934
<i>He just wants you to be safe.</i>

354
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,436
What about you?

355
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,980
I mean, I don't know if I could go through

356
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,400
what I went through last time
if you get hurt.

357
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you okay?

358
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,370
Not really.

359
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,998
What's up?

360
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,796
Do you remember when I told you
that I didn't want you going to Earth-2

361
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,090
<i>if you felt like
you didn't have anything left here?</i>

362
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,342
Yeah.

363
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,926
Because Patty left.

364
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,429
It wasn't just because of Patty.

365
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,015
What do you mean?

366
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,853
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

367
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,896
Me.

368
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,696
I've just been thinking a lot lately.

369
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,283
About us.

370
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>What Wells said
about us being married in the future?</i>

371
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,581
<i>And on Earth-2?</i>

372
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,252
And I can't help but wondering if,

373
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,046
maybe, we were meant to be together.

374
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,385
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

375
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,971
So,

376
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,769
(STUTTERS) When I told you
how I felt about you last year...

377
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,104
I wasn't available in that way.

378
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,984
But... But I am now.

379
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,154
Why are you telling me this now?

380
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,783
Because,

381
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,662
Barry, I need you to know
that it doesn't matter to me

382
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,080
<i>if you're The Flash or not.</i>

383

(VOICE BREAKING) You, Barry, that's who
I want to see if I have a future with.

384
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,549
I mean,

385
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,429
if you still want that, too, of course.

386
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,477
Um,

387
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,106
I should go see
if Jesse and Wally need anything.

388
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,236
Okay.

389
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,960
Come on.

390
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,844

RUPTURE: He needs to pay for
what he did to my brother.

And he will, later, Rupture.

What do you want me to do?

398

401
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,806
You disapprove.

402
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,683
You said you would spare them.

403
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,686
I need to teach them a lesson.

404
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:39,190
Is that why you change your voice,
so that everyone will be afraid of you?

What about Caitlin?

414
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,400

What are you gonna do, slugger?

417
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,080
Having The Flash might be the best way to

418
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,207
stop Zoom and all the metas
he's sending over.

that setting off the accelerator
will work,

it's too risky,

Are you sure this is the best plan?

00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,007
Look, I know you can't help as The Flash,

434
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,593
but stopping one of Zoom's cronies
sends him a message

435
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,136
that we won't be intimidated.

436
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,429
You think I made the right decision?

437
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,973
I don't know, Bar.

Yeah, all right.

What is this?

441
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,991
You went to another Earth?

442
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,577
You weren't supposed to read that.

443
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,829
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

444
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,623
So, yeah, I read it.

445
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,375
Look, I gotta go, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

446
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,335
No, man.
We're gonna talk about this right now.

447
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,671
Okay! Let's talk about this now.

448
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,005
What did you want me to say?

449
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,464
"What up, fam?

00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,760
"I know you probably don't care, but I'm
going off to another Earth for a hot sec.

"If I don't make it
back in time for dinner,

"it probably didn't go so well."

453
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,015
Why did you even go in the first place?

454
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,517
Because my friends needed my help.

455
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,061
What kind of help?

456
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,189
-They needed me to vibe.
-Vibe?

457
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,443
That's what that lunatic called you
who attacked us.

458
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,278
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

459
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,162
I have powers.

460
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,708
Powers?

461
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,879
What, you're like a meta-human?

462
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,849
I was affected when the accelerator
went off two years ago.

463
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,645
And now I see things, vibes, of people.

00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,396
Like, visions?

465
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,775
So that's why you called me.

466
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,652
Yeah.

467
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,570
I had one of you.

468
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,322
At least I thought it was you,

until your <i>World of Warcraft</i>
doppelganger showed up.

00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:19,661
-You killed his brother?
-No.

471
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,913
I didn't kill his brother. Of course not.

472
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,539
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

473
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,752
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

474
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,545
We haven't been close in years and...

475
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,299
And there's nothing
we can do to change that.

476
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,765
Look, I gotta go.

477
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,853
Just wait for me here, okay?

478
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,116
You all set, Cisco?

479
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,785
<i>Yeah, we're set.</i>

480
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,370
<i>Here he comes.</i>

481
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:20,305
Now where has everybody gone?

482
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,856
Flash. Not who I was expecting,
but you'll be a nice warm-up.

483
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,152
Too slow, Rupture.

484
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,329
Come on, Flash!

485
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082
-All right, time to win an Oscar.
-Let's do it.

486
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,686
-Get up.
-Are we the guys you were looking for?

487
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,355
Hope you like being alone,

488
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,357
'cause you won't be talking to anyone
in Iron Heights.

489
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,195
<i>Cisco, we got him. All good.</i>

490
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,239
-Okay, we're live! Sir...
-Get back. Get that camera back.

491
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,490
Get back.

492
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,784
{\an8}<i>Breaking news coming out of
Jitters coffee shop.</i>

493
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,870
<i>CCPN has learned that a meta-human</i>

494
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,206
<i>was just apprehended
after an altercation with The Flash.</i>

495
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,375
<i>-That's right...</i>
-You told them Rupture was coming.

496
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,918
<i>How?</i>

497
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,711
How?

498
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,969
You are smart, aren't you?

499
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,429
You betrayed me!

500
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,140
You said you would spare them.

501
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,771
-I guess now we're even.
-Jay, no!

502
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,901
My name is Zoom.

503
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,909
Oh, my God.

504
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,577
{\an8}No!

505
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,876
{\an8}<i>Make sure you get this.</i>

506
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,586
-What the...
-They gotta get out of there.

507
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,507
Everybody move!

508
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,940
Barry, don't!

509
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,900
<i>No!</i>

510
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:41,279
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

511
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,448
Hey, stop! Stop!

512
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,284
God... You've made your point.

513
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,954
Not quite yet.

514
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:57,753
You're an even bigger disappointment
than your brother.

515
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,601
{\an8}Central City, The Flash you've seen

516
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,312
in your streets is a fake.

517
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,233
A hologram meant to give you hope.

518
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,402
<i>But there is no more hope,</i>

519
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,989
<i>there is no more Flash,</i>

520
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,495
and there's no one left
to protect your city from me.

521
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,002
<i>Tell the rest of your force, Captain,</i>

522
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,588
<i>that their policing days are over.</i>

523
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,845
<i>You're only alive because of Caitlin.</i>

524
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:50,681
<i>Try something like this again,</i>

525
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,184
and my affection for her

526
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,062
won't stop me from killing you,

527
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,900
or the rest of this city.

528
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,543
Did you see this?

529
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,838
That's what you left to go do, wasn't it?

530
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,678
Look, man, I know you're mad at me,
and we haven't been close in a long time.

531
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,517
I want things to change.

532
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,730
You're my brother.

533
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,071
Okay.

534
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,867
Okay.

535
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,962
You know that wall's not just going to
open for you, right?

536
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,713
It might.

537
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,340
Yeah. Trust me. It won't.

538
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,052
We shouldn't be in here.

539
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,137
We should be out there, with them.

540
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,932
Why? So Zoom can take us again?

541
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,683
No. So we can help stop him.

542
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:18,811
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any powers.

543
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,271
I don't know.

544
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,733
But you're pretty quick at
solving "unsolvable problems."

545
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,028
Let's figure it out.

546
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,781
I will see what I can do.

547
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,618
It won't be long now.

548
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,620
He's moving faster
than he ever did on my Earth.

549
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,288
So what's next?

550
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,290
Next, he'll recruit
every meta-human he can find,

551
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,126
and then force them to do what he wants.

552
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,461
How many could be left?
We defeated most of them, didn't we?

553
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,838
<i>No. You're not even close.</i>

554
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,636
This is the list of meta-humans
from my Earth.

555
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>Ones that are the known, anyway.</i>

556
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:56,557
Particle accelerator explosion
was contained on my Earth.

557
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,559
<i>That didn't happen here.</i>

558
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:01,437
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

559
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,314
Because of The Flash.

560
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,483
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around...

561
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,193
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

562
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,403
We don't know that.

563
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,196
What more do you need?

564
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,408
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans,
we've seen him do that.

565
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,077
I told you he would kill those officers,
we saw him do that, too.

566
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,745
What more do you need?

567
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,333
Let's do it.

568
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,003
I wanna do it.

569
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,553
One of those cops that Zoom
killed tonight, he had a son.

570
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,555
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

571
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:38,599
Now another kid has to grow up
without one of their parents

572
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:43,188
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

573
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,068
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

574
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,945
I enabled him to rule this Earth.

575
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,863
I need my powers back.

576
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,285
Let's do it.

577
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,370
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

578
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,050
So how does this work?

579
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,636
It's an abbreviated version of
the accelerator evil Wells built,

580
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:20,141
except Harry is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

581
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,393
to direct it to Barry
instead of the entire city.

582
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,520
Good. Last thing we need is

583
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,814
more meta-humans
running around Central City.

584
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:32,778
So Barry just gets in,
you turn it on and that's it?

585
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,365
Yeah. No.

586
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,242
Not exactly.

587
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,536
In addition to recreating what happened
with the particle accelerator explosion,

588
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,705
we also have to recreate
what happened to Barry.

589
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,998
Getting struck by lightning.

590
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:45,916
That's right.

591
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,544
Wait, so how are you going to do that?
It's not even raining outside.

592
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,296
Well, Ramon, you have the wand?

593
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,257
The one I made for Mark Mardon?

594
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,259
No, the one you built
for the <i>Harry Potter</i> convention.

595
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,136
Yes, of course the one
you built for Mardon.

596
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,304
How do you know about
that <i>Harry Potter</i> convention?

597
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,391
Get the wand, get on the roof.

598
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,893
-Why the roof?
-Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

599
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,896
and that, Ramon, is going to be you.

600
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,907
All right, I'm on the roof.

601
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,536
I've never actually been up here before.

602
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,205
I think I can see my apartment from here.

603
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,956
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

604
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,542
When I give you the signal,

605
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,044
you're going to create
a lightning storm above you.

606
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,547
So I'm just supposed to stand here
in the middle of a lightning storm?

607
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,633
Really, Ramon, chances of being struck
are slim, indeed.

608
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,468
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it!

609
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,221
All we need is one lightning bolt
to strike the satellite.

610
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,972
The satellite's circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

611
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,309
Barry's in the breach room. Just do it.

612
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,643
<i>Yeah, I'm doing it.</i>

613
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,770
Mozart better watch out.

614
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,065
Cisco Ramon's about to
conduct something nasty.

615
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,655
You're gonna feel these clamps,
but they're necessary.

616
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,076
You good?

617
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,329
Yeah. Are you?

618
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,624
I'll be fine, Joe.

619
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,634
Barry, whatever happens,

620
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,512
it will never change the way
that I feel about you.

621
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:42,200
Son, you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

622
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,249
Being The Flash,
that's the best version of me.

623
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,379
If I don't have my speed,
I'll never be that person anymore.

624
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,964
I have to do this.

625
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,260
Okay.

626
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,473
<i>You ready, Allen?</i>

627
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,273
All right then. Here we go.

628
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,411
Think of it as hot-wiring a car.
Right, so there's a motor inside the wall.

629
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,204
So all we have to do is
provide electricity to make it turn on.

630
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,415
Exactly.

631
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,251
So let me just do a little here...

632
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,214
-Do you feel that?
-Yeah, what's happening?

633
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,427
<i>The particles are becoming unstable.</i>

634
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,470
Ramon, get ready.

635
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,806
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

636
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,942
Why are you doing this?

637
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,946
The night Barry was struck by lightning,
he was doing fingerprint analysis.

638
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,741
Those chemicals got in his system then,
and they are going in now.

639
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,242
So you're injecting them into him?

640
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,120
We have to recreate everything
that happened to Barry that night.

641
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,456
I'm okay, Iris.

642
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,124
Hold on, Barry!

643
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,796
-He's going hydrostatic.
-Almost there, almost there!

644
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,173
<i>-Wells!
-Almost there!</i>

645
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,051
-Ready, Ramon!
-Ready!

646
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,471
Now!

647
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,139
Expecto Patronum!

648
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,186
<i>Great Scott, it's working!</i>

649
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,274
No!

650
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,656
<i>Initiating collision.</i>

651
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,504
Barry!

652
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,367
It worked! Is everyone okay?

653
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,703
What happened?

654
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,889
No. What did you do to my son?

655
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:03,233
You thought you could give
The Flash his speed back?

656
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,405
Well done.

657
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,909
You killed him instead.

658
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,262
Dad, no...
