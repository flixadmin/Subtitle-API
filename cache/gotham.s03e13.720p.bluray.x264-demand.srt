but if what he says is true,
she could go to jail.

all that happens is he comes back again.

That girl, Melanie Blake,
his test subject,

204
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,689
she received thousands of volts
of electricity. That amount...

205
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,984
Would cause a power surge
in the electric grid.

BARBARA: About that.

320
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,906
I sent out the word.
Said you wanted to see everyone.

321
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,820
Express summons, etcetera, etcetera.

322
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,911
And, see for yourself.

323
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,496
This is a rebellion.

324
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,019
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

325
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,878
But I did warn ya.

326
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,420
You have been such a friend, Barbara.

327
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,091
Tell me, what should I do now?

328
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, if it were me,

329
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,102
I would pick one of them, the Duke maybe,
or Tommy Bones,

330
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,637
and teach them a lesson.

331
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,976
They don't respect you, Oswald.

332
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,813
In fact, you probably want to kill
Tommy Bones and the Duke.

333
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,018

Well, I'm glad you can find
the humor in it.

337
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:37,250
Did you really think
I would be so easy to manipulate?

338
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,209
What was your plan?

339
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,130
Take advantage of me
while I was in a weakened state?

340
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,384
Trick me into attacking my subordinates
so they truly did rebel?

341
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,803
Inciting war, so that
you could pick up the pieces? (LAUGHS)

My dear, you are tragically
out of your depth.

Oswald, I am your friend.

344
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,025
Perhaps I should call Tommy Bones.
Or the Duke.

345
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,795
Or any of the families, and ask them

346
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,992
if you really invited them
to this meeting?

I will gut you!

Did I not just see Harvey
punch him in the face?

409

What about you? You brought
a wounded suspect into the precinct

410

instead of taking him to the hospital,
because you wanted to interrogate him.

You guys can bend the rules, but I can't?

- Would you stop it?

Look, you want to blame me
for Mario's death, that's fine.

I can live with that, knowing you're okay.

turn you into something you're not.

punch a suspect in the face.
