1
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,448
Hey. Start recording.

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,283
I'll defeat you,

3
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,827
and rule as most powerful! Hah!

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,704
Not a chance.

5
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,459
Asshole! It hurts like hell! Shit!

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,713
Don't come near me! Aah! Stop! That hurts!

7
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,216
What the hell?

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,302
Run!

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,597
Shit!

10
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,934
Shit. Shit. Shit. Fuck.

11
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,770
Aah, you must be mistaken.

12
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,064
Our students are required
to check in their phones.

13
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,565
None of them could've called you.

14
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,484
Yeah.

15
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes, of course. Everything is just great.

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,654
Have a nice day.

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,078
Didn't I tell you to make sure
to take away their phones?

18
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,622
I even got you safes,
and they're saying zombies!

19
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,207
What the hell is wrong with you all?

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,917
You can't deny
there's a problem out there.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,876
It's complete madness.

22
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,003
We need the police and rescuers
to get the kids out--

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,130
Are you the only teacher?
Are you that special?

24
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,633
Whatever happens inside this school
must be handled internally!

25
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,802
Go! Put the kids in their classrooms.

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,512
But, sir, I don't think the students

27
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,847
are in the situation
where they will listen to us at all.

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,641
What are you still doing here?
Get out there!

29
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,227
And if you'd go out right now,
you can see for yourself

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,062
-that it's total chaos.
-Just do as you're told.

31
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,606
I made you the dean
to discipline them, so do that!

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,151
Where are you going, Sun-hwa?
Don't do anything stupid. Stay here!

33
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,695
I'm going to make an announcement
to tell all the kids to leave.

34
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,117
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,335
Hey, kid.

36
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,546
What's up with your leg?

37
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,880
Hey, stop that!

38
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,091
Hey! What are you doing?

39
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,718
Cut that out!

40
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,472
Ah…

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,573
What's with you?

42
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
Help! Help!

43
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,105
On-jo. Are you good?

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,274
Hey!

45
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,945
Get up.

46
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,830
Are you okay?

47
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,095
Go! Haste! Let's undo this.

48
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,858
Hurry and get up there!

49
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,693
Let's go over there!

50
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
Come on.

51
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,071
Fuck!

52
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,242
Fuck!

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,673
Come on.

54
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,757
You go first.

55
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,966
Oh, shit!

56
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,605
Get out. No!

57
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,235
Cheong-san!

58
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,453
Why aren't you coming? Come on!

59
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,539
On-jo.

60
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,000
Hurry up!

61
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,852
Run!

62
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,532
HYOSAN BUILDING MATERIALS

63
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,422
Come. This way. This way.

64
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,012
Wait up for me!

65
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,391
Stay away. Stay away, son of a bitch.

66
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,776
You should've stayed away, fucker!

67
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,870
Shit. What's going on?

68
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,831
Don't open the door. Don't open it!

69
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,166
Let go.

70
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,835
Hurry up! Lock the door! Go!

71
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,045
I need to open it.

72
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,463
You open it!

73
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,589
Move!

74
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,761
Are you okay?

75
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,137
On-jo!

76
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,016
Are you okay?

77
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,228
How's the campus? Are we dead or what?

78
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,156
Hey.

79
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,617
-What the hell? Who are you?
-Asshole. Brother…

80
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,286
-Brother-in-law.
-Oh, come in.

81
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,914
Holy shit.

82
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,874
They're so aggressive.

83
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,835
What happened to your face, huh?

84
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,754
I don't know, some crazy jerk sprayed me
with a fire extinguisher.

85
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,090
-A fire extinguisher?
-Yeah, damn it.

86
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,593
What's happening?

87
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,677
Who knows?

88
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,886
Train.

89
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
<i>-Train to Busan</i>.
-The movie?

90
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
Aren't they zombies? It's the same thing.

91
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,270
Zombies are at school?
You watch too much TV.

92
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,981
Watch this. It's true.

93
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,069
Really?

94
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,863
The door! Door!

95
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,822
Right.

96
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,201
Shit. What the hell?

97
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,911
What the fuck is that?

98
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,456
-Bare-su! It's Bare-su! Help him up!
-Quick! Quick! Quick!

99
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,041
Get in here. Hurry, man. You okay?

100
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,209
-Nam-ra! Hurry!
-Come on!

101
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,754
Hurry! Come on! Jump!

102
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
Close it. Quick.

103
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,550
Are you okay?

104
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,516
It's that, isn't it?

105
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,644
Zombies.

106
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,951
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

107
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,328
AMBULANCE

108
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,624
One, two, three.

109
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,587
-What happened to her?
-She came from the school.

110
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,882
She was bleeding when we got there.
But we're not sure exactly what caused it.

111
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,593
-When was she injured?
-We got the call about 30 minutes ago.

112
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
Why is she lethargic?

113
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,180
She seemed to be
having seizures at first,

114
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,515
but she calmed down now.

115
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
You received the PhD
in cell biology in the US,

116
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,825
returned to Korea.

117
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,662
You were a pharmaceutical researcher
and quit, then teaching.

118
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,708
You should be a college professor
with this résumé.

119
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,918
Definitely not
some lousy high school teacher.

120
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,797
The hospital needs to put Hyeon-ju
to quarantine, nothing less.

121
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,593
Why would a teacher decide
to chain a student?

122
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,637
If I were a college professor…

123
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,224
If I were a prosecutor, or a reporter,
would you have listened?

124
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,060
Ah, that's why you did it.

125
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,981
Because no one listened to you
or understood how you felt?

126
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,567
You were lonely, maybe saddened.
Is that it?

127
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,193
Fine.

128
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,779
Let's do nothing.

129
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,323
Everyone will die.

130
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,702
This world and all those damned imbeciles.

131
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,964
I hate you assholes. You're a sick kind.
Can't stand you.

132
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,136
You commit the crime,
but you blame others, society, everything.

133
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,683
When you reported your son missing,
you said, "The world swallowed my son."

134
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,436
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What, is the world an anaconda?

135
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,814
It didn't swallow him.

136
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,276
Tell me what really happened to him.

137
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,779
You killed your son.

138
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,366
But you reported him missing
to avoid being a suspect. Am I right?

139
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,536
Your son isn't missing, is he?

140
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,623
What happened to him, huh?

141
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,087
Jin-su is dead.

142
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,930
I placed the mouse and cat together.

143
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,807
MINSONG GYMNASIUM

144
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>Most of the mice sat in a corner,</i>

145
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,520
<i>and were frozen, trembling in fear.</i>

146
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,565
<i>But once in a while,</i>

147
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,443
the mouse would lose its senses
due to the overwhelming fear

148
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,903
<i>and attack the cat.</i>

149
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>When this happens,</i>
<i>its testosterone level shoots up.</i>

150
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,702
<i>I extracted that hormone and refined it.</i>

151
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,622
For all the mice in this world
living in fear, trembling.

152
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,471
<i>I thought if fear turned into rage,</i>

153
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>he'd become stronger than anyone.</i>

154
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,688
<i>He bit his mom.</i>

155
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,277
Infection, day 17.

156
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,697
I gave him benzodiazepine
and stopped the haloperidol.

157
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,241
He'll be awake in less than ten minutes.

158
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,458
You killed your son, didn't you?

159
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,731
-What the…
-Get her! Get her!

160
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,690
Turn it off!

161
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,869
Hold her down!

162
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,879
Oh…

163
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,017
-What's that sound?
-What's going on?

164
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,439
Is something going on in there?

165
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,443
Please help me.

166
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,071
Call the police! Please hurry!

167
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,315
God, I almost run her over.

168
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,483
What's the girl's problem?

169
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,577
People, you know what happens
when you perform like that?

170
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,164
Jang Ha-ri, get up.

171
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,333
Okay.

172
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
Take a good look.

173
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,089
She's your future.

174
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,759
Ha-ri's a senior…

175
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
without a single gold medal.

176
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,933
Forget the nationals
if she can't even make the reserves.

177
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,394
Couldn't even pass
today's regional qualifier.

178
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,980
What will you do, hm?

179
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,860
She can't get into college,
a corporate team…

180
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,487
No civil service exam. You didn't study.

181
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,034
Listen here. Do you know
how cruel this field is?

182
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,996
The CSAT top 100 kids get
into Seoul, yeah.

183
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,332
But if you're top 100 in archery,

184
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,419
you can't get anywhere near the Olympics.

185
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,504
You're the tritest rot.

186
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,256
Wasting away. Got it?

187
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,008
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

188
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,556
Shit. Fucking nut…

189
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,605
What the…

190
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,528
-See if it's there.
-It's not here, either.

191
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,573
Hey, Joon-yeong! I think you're right.
They can't open doors.

192
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,825
Uh… Let's hold it shut for now.

193
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,078
-Did you find one?
-There's nothing here, either.

194
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,245
-Damn it.
-Any luck, Dae-su?

195
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,455
Are you okay?

196
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,332
Look over there.

197
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,170
-It's not here, either.
-Here!

198
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,339
I found one!

199
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,551
Whose is it?

200
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,553
This is Yeong-ju's desk.

201
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,013
Shit. It's locked.

202
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,599
Do something.

203
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,309
What do you want me to do? It's locked.

204
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,520
Maybe it's her birthday.

205
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,396
When is that?

206
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,482
I don't know. Hmm…

207
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,278
She's over there. Give it.

208
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,329
SWIPE UP FOR FACE ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

209
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,335
You're gonna have to get closer.

210
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,009
For emergency calls,
you don't have to do that.

211
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,427
Just call 112.

212
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,599
AT THE SCENE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

213
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,564
-Hello. What is your emergency?
-<i>Hello?</i>

214
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,065
This is Hyosan High School.

215
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,152
A ton of zombies showed up at lunch,
and they're eating people.

216
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,653
Don't say zombies.

217
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>Then what?</i>

218
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>They won't believe you.</i>

219
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,367
Did you happen to see
the movie <i>Train to Busan</i>?

220
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,494
<i>Okay. Hyosan High, zombies.</i>

221
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,080
Please give me your name and phone number.

222
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,791
You know you'll get in trouble
for making these false reports, right?

223
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,459
This isn't a joke.

224
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,295
Everyone's…

225
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,922
Anyway, come quick.

226
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,923
Okay.

227
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,759
Lee Cheong-san.

228
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,471
Your number is 010-4362…

229
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,266
Get somewhere safe,
so that you don't get bitten. Okay?

230
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,101
We'll be there soon to check. Okay?

231
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,897
These brats think they're so damn clever.

232
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,816
Zombies are attacking.

233
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,151
Hyosan High, right?

234
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,987
They must be celebrating or something.

235
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,739
I just got a call about zombies too, sir.

236
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,490
Hello. What is the nature
of your emergency?

237
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,202
You're cutting out.
A patient is attacking people?

238
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,954
Does the person have some type of weapon?

239
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,498
She's biting them?

240
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,959
Zombie girl?

241
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,712
Hey. Go and call the school and verify.

242
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,797
Okay.

243
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,132
Hello. What's your emergency?

244
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,884
Hello. What is the nature
of your emergency?

245
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,719
-A person is biting people?
-What did you say?

246
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,974
SCHOOL MOTTO
HAPPY STUDENTS, SAFE SCHOOL

CLASS MOTTO
SUN-HWA IS WATCHING

248
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,771
No!

249
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,650
Whoa, what's going on?

250
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,818
-Where are they going?
-Why are they leaving?

251
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,325
-What are you doing, moron? Close it.
-Okay, fine.

252
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,534
You scared me.

253
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,827
And the police?

254
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,121
He said they'll come.

255
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,831
Did they believe you?

256
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,876
What if they think it's a prank
and decide not to come?

257
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,003
Well, then try again!

258
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,297
-And tell them to hurry up!
-Shh. Stop yelling.

259
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,674
What if those zombies come back?

260
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,550
Give me that.

261
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,228
<i>Fire Department.</i>
<i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

262
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,562
Hi. Hello, sir.

263
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,148
Do you know Captain Nam So-ju
from Rescue Team One?

264
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>I'm afraid I don't.</i>
<i>We have many firefighters.</i>

265
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,652
<i>What is this about?</i>

266
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,863
Captain Nam So-ju is my father.

267
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,283
Please tell him
to hurry over to my school.

268
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,368
-Who is she calling?
<i>-Sorry. This is the call center.</i>

269

<i>You should call his station</i>
<i>if you want to reach him personally.</i>

270
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,664
There's a fire.

271
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>-Fire?</i>
-Hyosan High School, classroom 2-5.

276
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,714
No one's coming?

277
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,634
I think something's happening at the gate.

278
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,096
Let's call the cops again.

279

Get them to listen.

I am, but they won't pick up.

Hey.

282
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,025
Do something.

283
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,402
Tell Miss Park to come and help.

284
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,989
Do something.

285
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,240
Do what exactly?

286
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't know. Anything!

287
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,538
What have you done as class president?

288
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,956
-Stop it.
-Huh?

289
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,554
Teacher's office?
So you just want me to leave now?

290
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,600
Well, if you're offering.

291
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,560
You told me to do something.

292
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,938
Do you want me to leave?

293
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
Stop it, you two.

294
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,193
She's only saying that
because you're the class president.

295
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,863
-Yeah. You are, right?
-So just be patient, okay?

296
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,744
So stupid. Typical.

297
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,329
What's typical?

298
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,379
Now that we are in this mess,
I'm your class president?

299
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,427
We called the police,
so I'm sure we'll be fine soon.

300
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,971
But no one's coming!

301
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,266
-Enough already. We're all scared too!
-That's why I'm telling them to call!

302
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,976
Why don't you do it, then?

303
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,395
Ladies, ladies,
can you just stop the whining?

304
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,730
Oh, now you're butting in, shithead?

305
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,524
What? Did you just call me a shithead?

306
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,026
Call me a shithead, you shithead?

307
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,781
-Let it go.
-Stop it.

308
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,075
Hold the door. I said hold the door.

309
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,369
Who the hell does she think she is?

310
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,787
Stop it.

311
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,957
-Did you hear what she said?
-Gyeong-su. Come on. Hold the door.

312
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,792
Let it go. It's nothing new.

313
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,086
-Enough already. I'm going.
-Block it. Just go block it.

314
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,589
-Fine. Seriously… Whoa!
-Shit!

315
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,594
Coach Kang.

316
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,681
Are you guys okay?

317
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,647
What about you? You weren't bitten?

318
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,318
No. Of course not. I'm, I'm all right.

319
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,321
Hey, guys. Let's block the door first.

320
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,449
Get moving. Hurry.

321
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,493
I'm fine. Let's move this.

322
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,535
Like this?

323
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,914
Yes, yes. Stack them high. High. High.

324
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,334
Coach Kang? You called the cops, right?

325
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,086
-You and the teachers. Help's coming.
-Yeah, sure.

326
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,964
What are you doing? Move quickly.

327
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,133
Stack it high. High.

328
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,259
Here.

329
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,678
-Stack it high.
-Higher?

330
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,306
Push it closer. Much closer.

331
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,559
On-jo, look.

332
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,602
What?

333
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,022
There. His arm.

334
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,027
Coach Kang.

335
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,112
Your arm.

336
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
What are you doing? Come help us.

337
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,492
-You have a bite mark on your arm!
-Is this…

338
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,952
What?

339
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,083
-What is it?
-I wasn't bitten.

340
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,669
-He said he wasn't bitten.
-No, no. I…

341
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,546
I, I wasn't bitten.

342
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,297
It's a bite mark.

343
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,591
I said it isn't.
Don't talk back to me. Okay?

344
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,635
-It looks like you were really bitten.
-I wasn't!

345
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,554
How many times must I tell you?

346
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,348
Then why the hell are you hiding it?
Just show it to us.

347
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,019
I think you should leave right now.

348
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,814
-What?
-Get out of here immediately.

349
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,650
You want me to go out there?

350
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,237
After all I did to get here?
You want me to go back out?

351
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,697
You were bitten.

352
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,574
Come on. Get out.

353
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,202
I said get out now!

354
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,453
Cocksucker!

355
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,290
How dare you yell at me like that?

356
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,375
You little…

357
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:26,918
Get over here.

358
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,628
Come here.

359
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,755
Now!

360
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,427
-You won't come? Hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.

361
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,555
-Stop. Stop. Stop it.
-He was bitten.

362
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,682
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Whoa, stay back.

363
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,309
Look.

364
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,393
Let go.

365
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,740
-You fucking bitch.
-Watch it!

366
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,492
Wait, wait.

367
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
-Holy shit.
-I think he really was bitten.

368
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,288
Guys, we should get out of here
as soon as possible.

369
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,873
Hey. Hey. He's turning.

370
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,753
Get him out of here! Hurry!

371
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,713
Hurry. Throw him out.

372
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,639
Do something!

373
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,808
No! Dae-su!

374
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,361
Min-ji…

375
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,450
Dae-su. I can't…

376
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,078
I don't want to die.

377
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,086
Get him… Get him out of here!

378
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:06,976
Cheong-san!

379
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,524
I don't want to die.

380
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,734
Help me.

381
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,839
Don't come closer.

382
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,717
Get away from me. No!

383
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,239
Stop it. Step out of the club, please.

384
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,532
We gotta go.

385
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,536
Get out! Get out!

386
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,206
-Let's go!
-Go, Cheong-san! Dae-su!

387
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,544
Hurry!

388
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,589
Hurry!

389
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,549
Get out!

390
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,550
Gyeong-su!

391
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,153
Watch your hands!

392
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,322
Watch out!

393
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,576
Hey! Get out of the way!

394
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,110
Hey! Come!

395
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,114
Come on, girls! Come on!

396
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,741
Push it!

397
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,868
Let's go!

398
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,245
Keep pushing!

399
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,455
Push!

400
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,377
Get out of here!

401
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,962
Girls, upstairs!

402
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,714
Let's go!

403
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,012
Hurry up!

404
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,566
No! No! Get back!

405
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,695
Back! Back! Back!

406
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,503
-Su-hyeok!
-Get to the lab!

407
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,380
Hurry!

408
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,185
Dae-su! Watch out!

409
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,524
Help me. Help!

410
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,485
Push!

411
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,986
Push!

412
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,659
-Push!
-Harder!

413
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,286
It's locked. Gotta go somewhere else!

414
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,955
Nowhere to go! We're surrounded!

415
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,082
-It's locked! Didn't you hear me?
-What now?

416
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,919
Try to open it!

417
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,713
-Can't you see it's locked?
-Hey, block the hole!

418
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,131
Dae-su, push!

419
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,967
Push!

420
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,939
Hey, hey, hey! Careful!
Watch your hands!

421
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,693
Why is it taking so long?

422
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,737
Hey!

423
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,116
-Above you!
-Hey, it's climbing over!

424
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,247
I can't hold them off
much longer. Hurry up!

425
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,290
It's open!

426
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,168
-Go!
-Push!

427
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,920
Push!

428
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,801
Hurry! Hurry! Go in!

429
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,180
Hurry!

430
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,747
Oh, shit.

431
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,290
Oh, damn it!

432
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,941
Get a desk!

433
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,860
Block it!

434
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,824
Block it.

435
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,926
Give me the phone.
I'm gonna try calling again.

436
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,636
Sorry, I lost it.

437
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,763
How could you lose it?

438
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,516
Who cares? We got a secured room now.

439
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,811
Like you can talk.

440
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,440
-What?
-It's because you didn't lock the door.

441
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,652
If you had done that, the gym teacher
wouldn't have gotten to us.

442
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,403
We almost died because of you.

443
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,405
Then why didn't you do anything yourself?

444
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,783
You're so fucking annoying.

445
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,409
Gyeong-su, no, no, no. Hey, don't.

446
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,121
-You bitch.
-Don't you touch me!

447
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,457
Fight after you move these.
This is not the time.

448
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,209
She's right. Stop it.

449
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,378
Yeah, fight after we finish this.
Gyeong-su.

450
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,466
Ugh! This is so fucking annoying!

451
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,899
Su-hyeok?

452
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,193
Has anyone seen him?

453
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,156
You were with him, right?

454
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,951
He was behind me.

455
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,369
Then where is he now?

456
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,748
I don't know.

457
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,363
They've all turned.

458
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,743
I think everyone except us turned.

459
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,329
We're outcasts again.

460
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,171
And this is still hell.

461
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,675
I hope everyone dies.

462
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,220
Every single one of them.

463
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,728
Shh! Shut the fuck up!

464
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,391
We should stay here a bit longer.

465
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,850
Right. Okay.

466
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,937
Do you think they're gone?

467
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,606
What do we do?
Shouldn't we go out and call the cops?

468
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,026
We can't go out now.
I'm sure they're still out there.

469
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,783
Also, who the heck is smoking
in here right now?

470
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,536
And who are you that you're hiding
in the girls' bathroom, huh?

471
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,330
Be a man. If you can even do that.

472
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,541
You… Who are you?

473
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,877
Leave her alone. It's Mi-jin.

474
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,838
Mi-jin? Park Mi-jin?

475
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:19,797
Yeah.

476
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,926
Joon-seong. I'm really dizzy.

477
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,512
Is it bad?

478
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,016
-Oh, no.
-I don't know. It's weird.

479
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,686
Everything sounds muffled,
and I'm dizzy.

480
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,690
Don't worry,
it's probably just from the shock.

481
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,151
We'll go to the hospital
when things calm down, okay?

482
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,736
Okay.

483
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,613
What is it? Who is it?

484
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,781
Hey, open up.

485
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,327
-Open up. Come on!
-What do you…

486
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,704
-Get out.
-What's wrong with you?

487
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,372
Stay still.

488
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,832
What's going on?

489
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,049
-What are you doing?
-I said to stay still, you moron!

490
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,425
Mi-jin.

491
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,635
Listen carefully.

492
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,347
You know how to play tag?

493
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,849
We hide.

494
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,477
We run to get away from someone.

495
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,020
Now…

496
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,067
Now, you are it.

497
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,601
Don't stand there! Help!

498
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,353
But Ha-lim's in there.

499
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,314
She was bitten. You got that? Now, help.

500
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,943
Mi-jin, don't do this.

501
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,861
I'm okay.

502
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,364
Let me out.

503
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,699
Shut up, zombie fucker!

504
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,284
Joon-seong, don't do this.

505
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,536
Let me out.

506
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,581
We ran away together earlier. I saved you.

507
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,044
If you let her out, we all die.

508
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,846
Shit. Shit!

509
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,516
Get it together. Look up.

510
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,435
What do you want from me?

511
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,187
-We have to kill her.
-Kill Ha-lim?

512
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,399
She's not Ha-lim. She's a… zombie.

513
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,860
Still, I don't wanna.

514
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,070
Do we have any other options?

515
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,323
I don't know.

516
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,036
Mi-jin. I hear you.

517
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,204
I know.

518
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,499
Do you really have
to do that to me?

519
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,917
You're going to turn, eventually.

520
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:07,923
I know. But you…

521
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,510
I will kill you first.

522
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,263
I'll kill you before anyone else.

523
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,307
Bitch.

524
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:19,977
Mi-jin.

525
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,898
I… I'm so scared.

526
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,043
Get ready.

527
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,213
I said to get ready.

528
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,422
For what?

529
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,174
We gotta kill her.

530
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,431
Are you gonna hold that forever?

531
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,493
Damn it.

532
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,911
What are you doing?

533
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,167
Why won't she die?

534
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,503
I don't know.
Maybe it's not the right spot.

535
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,220
What…

536
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,810
Stop. Not us. We're fine.

537
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,146
Not us, jackass!

538
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,109
Hey, I think they're okay.

539
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,235
Zombies don't curse.

540
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,153
Shoot if they turn.

541
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,532
You crazy bitch. We're fine--

542
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,371
Students and teachers
of Hyosan High School.

543
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,582
I'm Park Sun-hwa, the English teacher.

544
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,419
Something strange is happening
throughout the school.

545
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:14,091
<i>Some students</i>
<i>are attacking others indiscriminately.</i>

546
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,553
<i>So please flee and find a safe place.</i>

547
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,765
And if any student
or faculty hears this and is able to,

548
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,435
please call the police
and the fire department.

549
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:30,482
<i>Students, hide somewhere safe</i>
<i>until help arrives.</i>

550
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,278
<i>If you can get out of the school,</i>

551
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,196
<i>please get out.</i>

552
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,449
I'll say it again.

553
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,619
Some students are…

554
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,006
Hey, everyone…

555
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,718
You're okay, right?

556
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,720
<i>You're not hurt?</i>

557
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,806
I don't know

558
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,935
what's going on in here
or how this whole thing happened, but…

559
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,565
<i>Still, find a safe place and hide.</i>

560
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,283
<i>I… I'm sorry…</i>

561
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,245
<i>I can't help.</i>

562
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>Don't get hurt, okay?</i>

563
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>Please, let's stay alive and meet again.</i>

564
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,172
<i>Okay?</i>

565
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,519
<i>Rescue Team Three,</i>
<i>head to Hyosan Hospital.</i>

566
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,813
<i>Team Four, head to the accident</i>
<i>at Hyosan Intersection.</i>

567
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,107
<i>Team Two, you have another call.</i>

568
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,943
<i>Fire, Hyosan High School.</i>
<i>Please head there right away.</i>

569
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,153
<i>Ambulance One, stay where you are.</i>

570
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,657
Team One. We've arrived at the accident.

571
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,411
<i>Rescue Team Two. We'll head</i>
<i>to the accident at Hyosan High School.</i>

572
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,788
<i>Accident reports keep coming in.</i>

573
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,331
<i>All units, standby where you are.</i>

574
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,108
Let's go.

575
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,622
Fuck you!

576
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,250
-Why'd you do that?
-There was a fly.

577
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,634
You talked to On-jo, right?

578
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,928
She told Su-hyeok she likes him.

579
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,014
Okay, so?

580
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,767
Why don't you go and comfort her?

581
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,519
I keep trying, but you know.

582
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,271
No, forget it.

583
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,982
Why are you getting annoyed?

584
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,569
What does it have to be
my business who she likes?

585
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,365
Never mind.

586
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,626
On-jo.

587
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,711
Don't worry too much.

588
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,340
I'm sure Su-hyeok will be just fine.

589
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,176
He's a great athlete and super fast.

590
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,222
Mm-hm.

591
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,689
But…

592
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,943
Cheong-san's being super weird.

593
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,486
He's so annoying.

594
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:07,950
I think… he's so into you.

595
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,410
It's totally obvious!

596
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,789
I don't think so.
He doesn't feel things like that.

597
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,167
He's too busy teasing me all the time.

598
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,014
I-sak.

599
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,183
Why are you so cold?

600
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,310
So cold?

601
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,107
Your hand is really…

602
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,404
What about my hand?

603
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,498
I-sak.

604
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,836
-What's wrong? Are you--
-Really. I wasn't bitten.

605
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,465
I mean it. I really wasn't bitten.

606
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,510
She was bitten.

607
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,600
What's going on?

608
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,102
Did you get bitten?

609
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,353
I said I wasn't!

610
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,484
Hey. Are you okay?

611
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,246
On-jo.

612
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,665
I-sak.

613
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,884
No, right?

614
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,094
I'm not, right?

615
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,561
I'm not.

616
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,688
I'm not one of them.

617
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,658
What are you doing?
Get her out of here right now!

618
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,036
Shit. They're going to climb over.

619
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,913
No.

620
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,207
Come on. I said I'm okay.

621
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,844
On-jo.

622
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,721
Let go.

623
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,103
Hurry up! Do something!

624
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,398
Throw her out the window.

625
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,400
No. Let go.

626
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,527
Hurry! She's turning into a zombie!

627
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,656
I-sak, please don't.

628
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,381
I-sak.

629
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,634
I-sak, don't do this.

630
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,015
Stop it!

631
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,684
Stop it, please!

632
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,939
Cheong-san!

633
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,201
Are you crazy?

634
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,120
-Let go.
-I-sak.

635
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,538
You have to let go.

636
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,469
You want some glitter?

637
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,472
-It's fine. I can do it, okay?
-Go on.

638
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,556
I'll do it for you.

639
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,477
It's good. Look.

640
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,905
It looks great on you!

641
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:16,990
Get ready.

642
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,269
Hey!

643
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,814
Here!

644
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,916
On-jo.

645
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,647
Come block this!

646
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,970
Let's go.

647
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,472
We're not gonna last here longer.

648
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,640
Where would we go?

649
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,934
The hose from earlier.

650
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:31,935
Gyeong-su.

651
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,020
Yeah?

652
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,148
What?

653
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,652
What is it?

654
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,363
Open it just a few inches.
Enough for the hose to fit.

655
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,615
Isn't it better to wait
for the rescuers to come save us?

656
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,325
We might all die by the time they arrive.

657
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,452
This will kill us faster.
It's just gonna be--

658
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,746
Is waiting for someone to save us
the best thing we can do?

659
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,249
Oh, whatever.

660
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,876
If I turn into zombie… You're so mad.

661
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:47,886
Did you get it?

662
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,679
Hey!

663
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,850
Nam-ra, the door.

664
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,776
Help me make some knots.

665
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,486
How do you want it?

666
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,615
Wrap it and tie it.
So a hand or foot can fit.

667
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,075
You said big enough for a foot?

668
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,412
Zigzag. Make it a zigzag.
Big enough increments.

669
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,539
-Zigzag.
-Is this right?

670
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,165
We need more.

671
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,961
This is good, right?

672
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,216
Let's go.

673
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,061
Are we gonna make it down there?

674
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,523
I'll go down and check the empty rooms.
I'll call when it's clear, okay?

675
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,482
Okay.

676
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,025
Be careful.

677
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,445
Hold it.

678
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,531
What are you doing?

679
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,118
What is it?

680
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,787
Come on. Go down, dude.

681
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,624
What?

682
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,086
Gyeong-su, you go first.

683
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,963
Why? Did you see something?

684
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,798
No. But you go first.

685
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,175
What's down there?

686
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,469
Just go.

687
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,305
-You go. Go up there.
-Go already.

688
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,347
You should go.

689
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,682
Then you go, okay?

690
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,725
No. You can do it.

691
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,518
-Man, you can do it.
-Fuck.

692
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,646
But why… why am I…

693
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,898
Grab it and go.

694
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,901
Rock, paper, scissors?

695
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,069
-Just go. Come on.
-I mean…

696
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,571
Cowboy. Shit. God.

697
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,407
Where is it? Hold on.

698
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,242
Wait, I can't reach it.

699
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,536
-Put your foot in.
-Oh, I got it.

700
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,996
-Ohh.
-Careful.

701
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,372
Okay.

702
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,552
Damn it. Where is it?

703
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,816
Oh, shit. Okay, shit. Fuck.

704
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,985
Damn it.

705
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,448
I'll go down.

706
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,507
I wanna go down first.

707
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,553
One person at a time.
You might fall if it shakes too much.

708
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,221
Well, I won't shake it then.

709
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,849
-How long do you want me to wait?
-Just a little bit.

710
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,942
Shit. Why won't it come out?

711
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,737
Gyeong-su! Gyeong-su!

712
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,863
Ms. Park!

713
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,198
Gyeong-su!

714
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,117
-Are you okay?
-Quickly. Hurry.

715
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,827
-Be careful.
-Oh, right.

716
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,662
Cheong-san!

717
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,330
Hey, guys! Miss Park is here!

718
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,541
Miss Park is on the second floor.

719
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,585
The second floor? Broadcasting room?

720
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,295
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

721
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,380
Were you with the other kids
by any chance?

722
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,924
They're in the science lab.
They'll come down now.

723
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,010
Come down! Okay?

724
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:58,886
Come down!

725
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,096
Seriously!

726
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,432
What?

727
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,144
Careful. Careful. I got you.
Hold on. Hold on.

728
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,689
You're so heavy.

729
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,232
-Dae-su.
-Miss Park.

730
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,736
Be soon.

731
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,294
Grab the window frame. Okay.

732
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,378
-Grab her.
-I got you.

733
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,713
Let go.

734
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,922
-I have a cramp!
-You okay?

735
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,675
-Ah, shit.
-Straighten your knee.

736
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,552
-Not my legs!
-Watch out for your neck!

737
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,388
Good. You did great. You did great.

738
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,126
Go down.

739
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,048
I-sak…

740
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,591
You have to get it together.

741
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,844
Everyone in here lost a friend, On-jo.

742
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,222
Do you know how many people died?
Why are you so…

743
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,391
There's just no one left that I like.

744
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,564
Well, there are people who like you.

745
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:35,983
Like your dad.

746
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,031
You have to stay alive for them.

747
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,623
Let's go.

748
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,814
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE
BROADCASTING ROOM, NAM-RA

749
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,265
Oh…

750
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,835
Hurry.

751
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:18,753
Hurry up.

752
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,254
Grab her. Okay.

753
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,008
Careful. Okay. Okay.

754
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,151
