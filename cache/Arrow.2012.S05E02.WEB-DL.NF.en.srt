00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,004
GOD, I'D ALMOST FEEL BAD

162
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,505
ABOUT BOOSTING
THEIR STOCK PRICES

163
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,800
IF IT WASN'T SO GOOD
FOR YOUR APPROVAL RATINGS,

164
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,886
BUT, ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD
REALLY HANDLE THE PRESS

165
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,012
ON THIS ONE.

166
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,680
MAYBE YOU CAN...

167
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,390
GOD, OLLIE, I THOUGHT
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

168
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,019
I CAN'T KEEP DOING
EVERYTHING ON MY OWN.

169
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,436
I HAVE FAITH THAT YOU CAN,

170
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,856
BUT EITHER WAY, NOW
IS NOT A VERY GOOD TIME.

171
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,274
AND WHY IS THAT?

172
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,692
I'M RECRUITING A NEW TEAM.

173
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,194
OH.

174
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,653
YOU OK WITH THAT?

175
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,365
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

176
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,574
I QUIT.

177
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,034
NO, I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
A DIFFERENCE

178
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,785
BETWEEN LEAVING
AND BEING REPLACED.

179
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,204
OH.

180
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,289
IT'S REALLY CUTE YOU
THINK I CAN BE REPLACED.

181
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,456
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

182
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,833
I KNOW,

183
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,252
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD

184
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,545
FOR YOU TO NOT BE
OUT THERE SOLO ANYMORE.

185
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,048
PLUS IT WOULD MEAN
YOU HAVE MORE TIME

186
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,299
TO ACTUALLY BE HERE.

187
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,550
THAT'S THE IDEA,

188
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,843
BUT IT'S GOING
TO TAKE A MINUTE

189
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,178
TO GET THESE KIDS
UP TO SPEED.

190
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,804
WAIT, MAYBE I SHOULD
HIRE MY OWN TEAM

191
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,014
FOR THE OFFICE, THEN.

192
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,891
THAT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA.

FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THAT,

00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,537
HOW THE HELL DID THEY
KNOW WE WERE HERE?

323
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,663
UP, UP!

324
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,088
ON THE LINE.

325
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,924
I'M HERE TO LEARN
SOMETHING, MAN,

326
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,217
NOT JUST GET BEAT UP.

327
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,135
I TOLD YOU.

328
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,887
I'M TEACHING YOU.

329
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,389
TEACHING US WHAT,
EXACTLY?

330
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,391
BECAUSE, ACTUALLY,
I FIND MYSELF AGREEING

331
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,311
WITH THE SCARY,
WEIRD GUY.

332
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,062
THE GOAL OF THIS EXERCISE

333
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:37,400
IS TO FIGURE OUT THE GOAL
OF THIS EXERCISE.

334
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,277
NOW GET ON THE LINE!

335
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,154
FELICITY: ACTUALLY,
GREEN ARROW,

336
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,073
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

337
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,533
NOW.

338
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,244
YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT MAYBE

339
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,454
WE COULD HOLD OFF
ON THE CRITICISM

340
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,871
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

341
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,206
OH, YEAH, NO PROBLEM,
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT.

342
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,501
LOOK.

343
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,085
I THOUGHT THERE WASN'T
ANY USABLE FOOTAGE

344
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,211
FROM TRAFFIC CAMERAS.

345
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,338
YEAH, BUT WHO NEEDS
TRAFFIC CAMS

346
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,298
WHEN YOU GOT KH-10
SPY SATELLITES?

347
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,259
COULD BE A META
OR MAGIC OF SOME SORT.

348
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,385
EXACTLY.

349
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,928
SO THEA MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE TOLD ME

350
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,096
ABOUT YOUR
BRILLIANT PLAN

351
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,097
TO PROTECT
THE FREE CLINIC

352
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,766
ALL BY YOURSELF.

353
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,017
I WON'T BE ALL BY MYSELF.

354
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,602
I'LL HAVE
THE SCPD AND THE ACU.

355
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,812
NO WAY.

356
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,647
THIS IS OUT OF BOTH
OF THEIR LEAGUES.

357
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,191
WHAT?

358
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,234
IT'S OUT OF THEIR
LEAGUE, TOO.

359
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,944
THEY'RE TOO GREEN.

360
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,237
SOME COULD SAY
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

361
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,239
[LAUGHING] I'VE BEEN
WAITING 5 YEARS

362
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,033
TO MAKE THAT JOKE.

363
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
THE CONVENTION CENTER
HAS 20 ENTRANCES.

364
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,122
YOU CAN'T
BE ON THEM ALL.

365
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,332
THROW THEM AROUND
THE PERIMETER

366
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,375
FOR 3 EXTRA PAIRS
OF EYES.

367
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,418
WHAT COULD IT HURT?

368
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,048
OLIVER: OK,
HEADS ON SWIVELS,

369
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,676
BUT DO NOT ENGAGE
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

370
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,677
COPY THAT.

371
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,845
YES, SIR.

372
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,055
I MEAN, OLIV...
I MEAN, GREEN ARROW.

373
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,223
WILD DOG,
DO YOU COPY THAT?

374
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,641
WE GOT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS CODENAME.

375
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,142
OLIVER: NOT NOW.
STAY FOCUSED.

376
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,644
YOU KNOW, IT'D HELP
TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

377
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,936
OLIVER: NO, IT WOULDN'T,

378
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,146
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO ENGAGE.

379
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,565
COME ON, WHERE'S
THE FUN IN THAT?

380
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,817
EVELYN: MAN, IT WOULD
TAKE ONE MAJOR ASSHAT

381
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,652
TO MAKE A MOVE AGAINST
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

382
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,028
CURTIS: SOMETHING
I'VE LEARNED RECENTLY

383
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,822
IS THE CITY IS
FILLED WITH THEM.

384
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,699
STARTS AT THE TOP,
YOU KNOW?

385
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,368
PRETTY BOY QUEEN HERE

386
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,246
THINKS HE'S ACTUALLY
SAVING THE CITY.

387
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,207
THANK YOU,
OFFICER.

388
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,333
HOW ARE YOU?

389
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,169
HELLO.

390
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,170
HI.

391
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,171
DOCTOR: HI.

392
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,339
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

393
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,758
HER BROKEN BONE
NEVER SET.

394
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,092
OH, YOU'LL BE FINE.

395
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,510
I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
WITH THAT.

396
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,598
EVELYN, CHECK
THE NORTHWEST CORRIDOR.

397
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,973
I DON'T GET A CODENAME?

398
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,642
WE REALLY THANK YOU
FOR STICKING WITH US.

399
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,937
OH, WELL, I'M GLAD THAT
OLIVER CHANGED MY MIND.

400
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,898
IT'S NICE TO FEEL
THAT THIS COMPANY

401
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,108
CAN STILL DO SOME GOOD.

402
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,444
UM, SORRY I'M LATE.

403
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,738
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

404
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,906
THE EVENT IS ALMOST OVER.

405
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,323
YEAH, I KNOW,

406
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,742
BUT IT'S BEEN TYING UP
TRAFFIC, YOU KNOW?

407
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,951
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO WATCH

408
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,369
THE 10TH STREET
ENTRANCE.

409
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,205
I JUST SAID,
THE TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE.

410
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,665
ARE YOU OK?

411
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,793
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, I'M...
I'M FINE, YOU KNOW.

412
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,879
SORRY, IT WON'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

413
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,047
YEAH, BUT...

414
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,718
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
DRINKING AGAIN,
HAVE YOU?

415
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,386
[JANET SCREAMING]

416
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,102
JANET CARROLL,

417
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,105
YOU HAVE BEEN JUDGED
AND FOUND WANTING.

418
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,150
HE'S HERE.

419
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,403
[CROWD SCREAMING]

420
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,863
SON OF A BITCH.

421
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,621
OLIVER: OVERWATCH?

422
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,122
I DON'T SEE HIM ON ANY
OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS.

423
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,457
IT'S LIKE HE JUST...
DISAPPEARED.

424
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,708
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT

425
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,376
IF I DIDN'T SEE HIM DO
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF

426
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,377
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE.

427
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,214
CURTIS: I'M ALMOST
AFRAID TO ASK...

428
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,342
ACTUALLY,
I AM AFRAID TO ASK...

429
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,718
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I'M JUST AFRAID.

430
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,886
IS HE COMING?

431
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,721
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

432
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,389
DID HE SOUND...

433
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,100
UNHAPPY?

434
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,727
WHY DID YOU DO THAT,
ANYWAY?

435
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,856
HE SPECIFICALLY TOLD US
NOT TO ENGAGE!

436
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,023
FIRST, HE'S NOT
THE BOSS OF ME,

437
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,525
NEVER WILL BE.

438
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,151
SECOND, IF HE THINKS I'M
JUST GOING TO STAND BACK

439
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,361
AND WATCH SOME
LITTLE GIRL GET HURT,

440
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,445
THEN HE NEVER SHOULD
HAVE RECRUITED ME

441
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,071
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

442
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,448
I THINK THAT'S
QUICKLY BECOMING
THE MAJORITY OPINION.

443
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,116
THIRD, IF I HADN'T
DONE WHAT I DID,

444
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,869
I WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN THIS.

445
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,077
WAIT, IS THAT
A PIECE...

446
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,579
YEAH, THE RAG MAN.

447
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,164
NOW, I MAY BE NEW
AT THIS AND ALL,

448
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,082
BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU GUYS CALL "EVIDENCE"?

449
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,501
OLIVER: ON THE LINE.

450
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,711
LISTEN, BEFORE
YOU SAY ANYTHING,
I THINK...

451
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,546
MY INSTRUCTIONS
WERE SPECIFIC.

452
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,839
BY NOT LISTENING,

453
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,549
YOU PUT EVERY ONE
OF OUR LIVES AT RISK.

454
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,550
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN...

455
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,592
NOW, I KNOW
THAT NONE OF YOU

456
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,052
ARE READY FOR THIS,

457
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,512
BUT NOW I'M NOT SURE IF
YOU'RE EVER GOING TO BE,

458
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,972
BECAUSE YOU
ARE RECKLESS,

459
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,765
YOU'RE USELESS IF YOU'RE
NOT BEHIND A COMPUTER,

460
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,433
AND YOU ARE JUST
A LITTLE GIRL

461
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,935
WHO SHOULD BE DOING
SOMETHING BETTER

462
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,478
WITH HER LIFE!

463
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,146
FELICITY:
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH
PEP TALK FOR ONE DAY.

464
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,232
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

465
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,529
DID YOU LEARN NOTHING

466
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,864
FROM WHAT HAPPENED
TO CURTIS LAST YEAR?

467
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,532
NOW, YOU KNOW I DON'T
HAVE A BEDSIDE MANNER.

468
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,867
THERE'S HAVING
NO BEDSIDE MANNER,

469
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,035
AND THEN THERE IS BEING

470
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,452
PHYSICALLY
AND EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE.

471
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,954
IT TOOK ME YEARS 5 IN HELL

472
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,539
TO TURN INTO SOMEONE
CAPABLE OF GOING OUT THERE.

473
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,874
YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T
HAVE 5 YEARS?

474
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,002
LAUREL LANCE.

475
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,088
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

476
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,131
OH, WERE THOSE 5 YEARS
JUST FULL OF PAIN
AND SUFFERING,

477
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,300
OR DID YOU HAVE SOMEONE
WHO TAUGHT YOU?

478
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,344
I HAD A FEW PEOPLE
WHO TAUGHT ME,

479
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,638
AND I'M TRYING
TO TEACH THEM.

480
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,765
WHAT, TO TAKE A PUNCH?

481
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,933
AN INSULT?

482
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,225
YOU KEEP EXPECTING THEM

483
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,643
TO DO WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING THEM TO DO,

484
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,854
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT
GIVING THEM ANY REASON.

485
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,188
YOU JUST KEEP JABBING
THEM WITH A CATTLE PROD,

486
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,356
EXPECTING THEM
TO PERFORM,

487
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,816
AND THE GUY THAT YOU
CALLED RECKLESS

488
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,444
GOT US OUR ONLY CLUE
WE HAVE SO FAR.

489
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,239
I NEED YOU TO DO
A FULL WORKUP ON THAT.

490
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,449
YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T.

491
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,784
I MEAN, NOT HERE.

492
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,037
THE GHOSTS DESTROYED
OUR GAS CHROMATOGRAPH,

493
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,957
BUT I HAVE
OTHER METHODS.

494
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,541
GOOD.

495
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,501
I HAVE TO GET TO CITY HALL.

496
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,963
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

497
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,338
THE CITY JUST EXPERIENCED

498
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,174
THE EQUIVALENT
OF A TERRORIST ATTACK.

499
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,927
THOSE 3 CAN WAIT.

500
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,888
JOHN: YOU SHOULD GET
TO THE MEDIC TENT

501
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,222
WHEN WE GET BACK,

502
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,557
BUT THIS SHOULD HOLD YOU
FOR A FEW HOURS.

503
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,225
A FEW HOURS?
WHY, WE'RE NOT BUGGING OUT?

504
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,644
OUR ORDERS ARE
TO GET THAT TRIGGER.

505
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,979
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

506
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,396
THE MEN ARE ON
THE SECOND FLOOR.

507
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,815
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY
GUYS ARE UP THERE.

508
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,024
YOU REMEMBER WHAT I
TOLD YOU ABOUT FEAR?

509
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,150
GETS YOU THROUGH.

510
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,401
THAT'S RIGHT.

511
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,361
AND SO DOES
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

512
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,947
WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT DO OR DON'T

513
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,407
OR RIGHT OR WRONG.

514
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,368
THERE'S A CLARITY
IN THAT, RIGHT?

515
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,996
A PEACE.

516
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,622
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

517
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,167
FALL OUT.

518
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,295
SECURE THE SOUTH HALLWAYS.

519
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,922
I'LL TAKE THE NORTH.

520
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,342
MAN: CONTACTS WILL
BE HERE ANY MINUTE,

521
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,929
SO LET'S KEEP OUR HEADS
ON SWIVELS, LADIES.

522
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,472
JOHN: THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE EITHER DEAD OR GONE.

523
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,389
COLLINS TOOK
A THROUGH-AND-THROUGH.

524
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,474
HE'LL BE FINE, BUT...

525
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,225
[GUN COCKS]

526
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,560
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

527
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,104
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, SERGEANT.

528
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,150
YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO SECURE THE TRIGGER.

529
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,526
YOU'RE STEALING IT.

530
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,820
CAN'T STEAL ANYTHING
IF NOBODY OWNS IT.

531
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,238
NOW, YOU BE CAREFUL NOW,
SERGEANT.

532
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,199
YOU JUST MIGHT
LIVE THROUGH THIS.

533
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,786
FELICITY: NOT THAT I
WOULD NORMALLY CONDONE

534
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,412
DRINKING THIS
MUCH CAFFEINE,

535
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,165
BUT SINCE YOU ARE
SO BUSY TRYING TO SAVE

536
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,374
THE ENTIRE CITY
AND ALL...

537
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,500
ADD IT TO THE LIST OF VICES

538
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,960
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO SWEAR OFF.

539
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,461
OH, DO I EVEN
WANT TO KNOW?

540
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,671
JUST AS MUCH
AS I WANT TO KNOW

541
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,464
WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

542
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,091
YOU ALREADY BOUGHT ME
AN AMERICANO THIS MORNING

543
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,384
BEFORE I GOT TO WORK.

544
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,180
AND THAT'S WHY YOU
ARE THE DETECTIVE.

545
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,723
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I DATED ANYONE.

546
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,224
IS THIS A THING NOW?

547
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,559
NO, THIS IS NOT A THING.

548
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,270
THIS IS...THIS IS...

549
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,107
A VERY LONG,
FUNNY STORY.

550
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,274
DO YOU...

551
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,194
WANT TO TELL ME
THIS STORY?

552
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,820
YEAH. THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE.

553
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:42,658
UM, THIS BELONGED
TO MY FRIEND'S MAID...

554
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,951
CLEANING LADY.

555
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,494
YOUR FRIEND'S
CLEANING LADY?

556
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,704
SHE'S GONE MISSING.

557
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,789
AND HE'S VERY WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

558
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,291
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A REPORT
TO MISSING PERSONS?

559
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,626
NO, NO, NO.
I WAS THINKING THAT...

560
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,087
WELL, SHE LEFT
THIS RAG BEHIND,

561
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,629
SO I WAS THINKING THERE
MIGHT BE SOME EVIDENCE

562
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,923
LEFT BEHIND ON IT

563
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,465
THAT, UM...

564
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,467
COULD HELP MY
FRIEND LOCATE
HER CLEANING LADY.

565
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,804
I THOUGHT YOUR FRIEND
WAS A GUY?

566
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,139
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

567
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,974
ONLY INSOFAR AS I HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY MET

568
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,685
ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS YET.

569
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,730
AND, YES, THAT'S A HINT
OFFICIALLY BEING DROPPED.

570
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:17,193
HINT NOTED.

571
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,570
SO JUST A QUICK
FORENSIC WORKUP,

572
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,821
LIKE MAYBE JUST
A QUICK PASS

573
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,950
THROUGH THE GAS
CHROMATOGRAPH?

574
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
FINE.

575
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,702
IT'S YOUR TAX DOLLARS.

576
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,579
YOU ARE THE BEST.

577
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,334
THEA, MAY I SPEAK...

578
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,003
-HI.
-HI.

579
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,422
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

580
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,673
IS EVERYTHING OK?

581
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,092
UH, YEAH, YEAH,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

582
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,093
I WAS JUST
TALKING TO THEA

583
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,177
ABOUT MAYBE COMING ABOARD,

584
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,804
HELPING OUT
WITH SOME STUFF.

585
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,805
YEAH.

586
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,473
YEAH, ANYWAYS.

587
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,349
SO, UM...ANYWAY,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

588
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,350
OK.

589
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,351
OK.

590
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,230
UH, THANKS.

591
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,522
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

592
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,857
IT...IT'S NOTHING.

593
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,358
LOOK, WE HAVE
WAY BIGGER PROBLEMS

594
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,359
ON OUR PLATE RIGHT NOW.

595
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,527
BECAUSE OF YOU,

596
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,988
WE ARE ON THE HOOK
WITH AMERTEK,

597
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,656
AND THE C.E.O.
IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

598
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,991
ACTUALLY,
SHE WAS JUST RELEASED.

599
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,325
SHE'S FINE.

600
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,785
OK, BUT SHE'S GOING
TO HIT THE CITY

601
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,369
WITH A MULTI-MILLION-
DOLLAR LAWSUIT.

602
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,663
WELL, CAN YOU SPEAK TO HER?

603
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,039
MY HANDS ARE KIND OF
FULL RIGHT NOW.

604
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,707
OK. WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

605
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,251
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH QUENTIN?

606
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,171
I AM 90% SURE
HE'S DRINKING AGAIN.

607
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,923
I'M 100% SURE.

608
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,925
HE TOLD ME WHEN I SAW
HIM LAST WEEK.

609
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,637
OLLIE, I PUT HIM TO WORK
SECURITY AT THE EVENT.

610
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,472
THE DUDE IN RAGS CAME IN
THROUGH THE DOOR

611
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,599
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING.

612
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,226
THEA, I'M SORRY.

613
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,936
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO REACH OUT TO HIM,

614
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,271
BUT WHY IS HE TALKING

615
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,856
LIKE HE'S GOING
TO BE WORKING WITH US?

616
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,982
"I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW"?

617
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,151
WHAT IS THAT?

618
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,652
HE'S HURTING, OLLIE.

619
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,820
I DON'T THINK
THAT PUTTING HIM

620
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,155
IN A POSITION
OF RESPONSIBILITY

621
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,572
IS THE BEST IDEA FOR HIM

622
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,034
OR FOR US RIGHT NOW.

623
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,535
OK?

624
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,744
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

625
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,288
[PHONE BEEPS AND VIBRATES]

626
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,583
I HAVE TO GO. THANK YOU.

627
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,419
WHAT'S GOING ON?

628
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,921
WHERE ARE OTHERS?

629
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,798
SOMEWHERE NOT HERE.

630
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,091
THEY QUIT.

631
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,383
THIS REALLY
SHOULDN'T COME

632
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,011
AS ANY SORT
OF SURPRISE TO YOU.

633
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,386
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

634
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,555
WE CHOSE
THE WRONG PEOPLE.

635
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,597
INCLUDING ME, RIGHT?

636
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,932
CURTIS.

637
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,433
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PURPOSE

638
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,853
OF THIS EXERCISE IS?

639
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,521
TO FIGURE OUT THE PURPOSE
OF THIS EXERCISE?

640
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,065
NO, IT'S TO WORK TOGETHER,

641
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,108
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY THAT YOU WIN.

642
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,902
THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO TEACH ALL OF YOU.

643
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,863
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
A REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T.

644
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,948
WE DON'T TRUST YOU.

645
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,033
THAT'S ON YOU.

646
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:29,950
NO, MAN.

647
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,160
THAT'S ON YOU.

648
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,828
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
TRUST US,

649
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,621
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT US.

650
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,622
OK, THIS IS A SETBACK,

651
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,832
BUT WE CAN SALVAGE THIS.

652
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,251
THEY'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

653
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,626
CAN YOU JUST TELL THEM

654
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,961
HOW OLIVER USUALLY
APPROACHES THINGS AND...

655
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,963
I TRIED THAT.

656
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,382
I TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT

657
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,385
HOW YOU AND SPEEDY
AND SPARTAN WERE A FAMILY,

658
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,179
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE
TOUGH AND SCARY

659
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,390
AND EVEN A LITTLE ABUSIVE,

660
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,934
THEY CLEARLY TRUSTED YOU
BECAUSE THEY STOOD BY YOU.

661
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,230
BUT THEN IT HIT ME.

662
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,814
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

663
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,440
THEY LEFT,

664
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,318
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.

665
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,444
YOU DON'T RESPECT PEOPLE.

666
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,654
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HAVE PARTNERS.

667
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,323
YOU DON'T BUILD
PEOPLE UP.

668
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,118
YOU TEAR THEM DOWN.

669
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,328
I THOUGHT I COULD
TRUST YOU...

670
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,039
WE COULD TRUST YOU.

671
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,334
I WAS WRONG.

00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,516
AS MUCH AS I USUALLY
LOVE HEARING

676
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,644
THOSE 3 LITTLE WORDS,

677
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,606
GLOATING RIGHT NOW WOULD
BE LIKE KICKING A PUPPY.

678
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,401
I FAILED THESE RECRUITS
AS A LEADER.

679
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,612
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT A LEADER.

680
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,448
WELL, IN YOUR DEFENSE,
YOU NEVER SET OUT TO BE.

681
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,201
YOU NEVER PLANNED ON
DOING THIS WITH PARTNERS.

682
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,620
THOUGH, I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY EVER HAD A WAY

683
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,621
AROUND THAT ONE.

684
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,623
HOW SO?

685
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,625
WHEN I GOT TO KNOW YOU...

686
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,920
THE REAL YOU...

687
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,969
I WAS IN AWE.

688
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,555
I HAD NEVER MET SOMEBODY
SO PASSIONATE...

689
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:21,270
SO FOCUSED AND DETERMINED
TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE.

690
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,147
BUT THE RECRUITS

691
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,816
DIDN'T GET TO SEE
THE REAL YOU

692
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,567
BECAUSE ALL YOU SHOWED THEM

693
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,527
WAS THIS ANGRY GUY
IN A MASK,

694
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,071
LIKE SCARY ANGRY.

695
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,282
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IF THEY
DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS,

696
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,825
IT WOULD MAKE THINGS EASIER.

697
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,243
HOW WOULD THAT MAKE
THINGS EASIER FOR THEM?

698
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,495
FOR ME.

699

EASIER FOR ME.

NOBODY IN THE BRATVA
USES THEIR REAL NAMES.

IT'S EFFECTIVE.

707

THEY TEACH YOU THAT
THE ONLY PERSON
YOU CAN TRUST

I LET THEM IN...

963
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,169
SORRY IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT, YOU KNOW.

964
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,503
OK, QUENTIN, THAT'S...

965
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,506
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO WORK FOR ME.

966
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,967
WHAT?

967
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,094
YOU LEAVING AND HITTING
THE BOTTLE AGAIN, OK?

968
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,929
NO, I THINK WE CAN
DO BETTER THAN THAT.

969
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,013
I'VE BEEN TO MEETINGS.

970
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,347
NOT A MEETING.

971
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,142
A JOB.

972
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,437
HOW DOES
DEPUTY MAYOR SOUND?

973
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,607
YOU WANT TO...YOU WANT
TO HIRE A DRUNK

974
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,818
TO BE YOUR
DEPUTY MAYOR, HUH?

975
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,821
WHAT, OLIVER'S APPROVAL
RATINGS ARE NOT LOW ENOUGH?

976
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,489
IF WE WERE HIRING
A DRUNK,

977
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,824
THAT WOULD BE
A VERY GOOD POINT,

978
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,700
BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

979
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,038
WE ARE HIRING
THE FORMER CAPTAIN
OF THE SCPD WHO...

980
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,082
WHO JUST LOST
HIS DAUGHTER

981
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,667
AND IS HONORING
HER MEMORY

982
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:00,379
BY DEDICATING
HIMSELF TO THE CITY
THAT SHE LOVED.

983
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,674
OK, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT ONE?

984
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,889
I THINK MAYBE THE WRONG
QUEEN RAN FOR MAYOR.

985
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,224
LOOK, OLLIE,

986
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,685
HE TOLD ME YOU SAID

987
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:19,899
THAT YOU NEEDED A REASON
TO STAY SOBER, SO...

988
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,068
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THIS COULD BE IT.

989
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,243
YEAH, MAYBE IT COULD.

990
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,494
YOU LET CHURCH
ALMOST KILL YOU

991
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,787
SO THAT YOU COULD
RECRUIT RAGMAN?

992
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,164
I WAS BETTING
THAT HIS HEROISM

993
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,498
WOULD TRUMP HIS VENGEANCE.

994
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,624
THAT'S A BIG RISK
TO TAKE ON A STRANGER,

995
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,709
DON'T YOU THINK?

996
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,626
YEAH.

997
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,379
WELL, I'M NOT DONE YET.

998
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,881
HEY.

999
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,258
-YEAH.
-ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1000
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,552
YEAH. FINE.

1001
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,097
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

1002
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,515
RENE: I ONLY CAME

1003
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,684
BECAUSE BLONDIE SAID
THERE'D BE AN APOLOGY.

1004
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,396
WELL, BLONDIE
MADE A GOOD POINT.

1005
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:07,030
YOU'RE NOT JUST JOINING
UP WITH THE GREEN ARROW.

1006
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,000
YOU'D BE JOINING UP
WITH ME.

1007
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,836
THE GREEN ARROW
IS THE MAYOR?

1008
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,588
CURTIS: I HAD THE SAME
COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.

1009
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,923
RENE: I HOPE YOU DON'T
THINK I'M GOING
TO APOLOGIZE

1010
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,549
FOR THE TRASH
I TALKED ABOUT YOU.

1011
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,800
NO MORE THAN I'M GOING
TO APOLOGIZE

1012
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,635
FOR THE TOUGH TRAINING,

1013
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,265
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ALL NEED
TO TRUST ME.

1014
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,893
THIS IS AS FAR
AS I KNOW HOW TO GO.

1015
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,644
YOU'RE SORT OF ASKING
WITHOUT ASKING

1016
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,980
IF WE WANT TO COME
BACK, RIGHT?

1017
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,024
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S DOING.

1018
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,610
OK. GOOD.

1019
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,195
THEN I'M IN.

1020
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,821
ME, TOO.

1021
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,742
WILD DOG?

1022
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,411
I'LL FIGHT ANY WAR

1023
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,663
AS LONG AS I TRUST WHO'S
LEADING ME INTO BATTLE...

1024
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,459
BUT WE HAVE GOT
TO RETHINK THIS CODENAME.

1025
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,463
NO CHANCE.

1026
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,634
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

1027
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,514
HEH HEH HEH!

1028
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,849
AH...

1029
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,977
CAN'T STAY AWAY
FROM ME, CAN YOU?

1030
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,109
YOU ALMOST KILLED
THE GREEN ARROW

1031
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,193
THE OTHER NIGHT.

1032
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,111
IF YOU HAD,

1033
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,862
YOU'D BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

1034
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,156
WHO THE HELL...

1035
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,368
THE GREEN ARROW IS MINE.

1036
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,371
YOU KILL HIM, YOU DIE.

1037
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,165
WHO ARE YOU?

1038
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,502
PROMETHEUS.
