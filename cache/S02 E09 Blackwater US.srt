1
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,174
That's it.

2
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,470
Hold on.

3
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,295
-The tide's against us.
-Aye, but we have the wind.

4
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,422
She'll blow us straight to the gates.

5
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,633
You're coming home.

6
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,635
King's Landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.

7
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,766
I spent most of my life dodging
the royal fleet.

8
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,853
And now, I'm sailing right at them.

9
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,105
This is the royal fleet.

10
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,524
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

11
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,653
Of course, there are several royal fleets
at the moment.

12
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,029
Not after tonight.

13
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,990
When the sun rises, Stannis will sit
on the Iron Throne

14
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,784
and you will be his Hand.

15
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,327
-Gods be good.
-God...

16
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,372
Father, there's only one
and he watches over us.

17
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,082
-But not over them?
-Over all of us.

18
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,709
The people of King's Landing
did not choose

19
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,169
the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.

20
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,339
They will be glad to see his head
on a spike.

21
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,257
But first, we have to put it there.

22
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,969
Our ships outnumber theirs ten to one.

23
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
Our army outnumber theirs five to one.

24
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,059
Those walls have never been breached.
And the men guarding the walls,

25
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,269
when they see you,
they don't see a liberator.

26
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,065
They see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

27
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,486
I have faith in the Lord of Light.
I have faith in our cause.

28
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,990
And I have faith in my captain.

29
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,359
Are you afraid, my lion?

30
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,785
If this city falls, Stannis will burn
every Lannister he can find.

31
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,414
Of course I'm afraid.

32
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,544
I won't let them hurt you.

33
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,595
I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice
in all this.

34
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,931
But it's not your war.

35
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,231
It is now.

36
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,405
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

37
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,575
I have so far.

38
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,831
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

39
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,003
That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.

40
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,479
As you know, Your Grace,
it is not only the sworn duty

41
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,858
of a maester to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

42
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:46,864
but also to offer guidance and console
in times of war.

43
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,909
Your words are always wise and measured.
If you could--

44
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:55,915
If anything, a maester's duties
become more urgent

45
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,293
in times of war and in turmoil.

46
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,048
I remember back in the days of King--

47
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,176
-You brought me something?
-Yes.

48
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:17,228
Essence of nightshade is as dangerous
as it is efficacious.

49
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:24,694
A single drop in a cup of wine suffices
to soothe ragged nerves.

50
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,448
Three drops will bring on a deep
and dreamless sleep.

51
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,120
-Ten drops, however--
-I know what ten drops will bring.

52
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,832
-You Grace, if I may ask--
-You may not.

53
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
You must have a lot of work to do.

54
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,548
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

55
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,261
Yes. A siege is very--

56
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,388
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

57
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,310
Your Grace...

58
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,773
And so he spoke

59
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,737
That Lord of Castamere

60
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,656
But now the rains

61
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,705
Weep o'er his halls
With no one there to hear

62
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,124
Yes, now the rains

63
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,668
Weep o'er his halls

64
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:28,549
And not a soul to hear

65
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,011
-Good boys!
-Lannisters!

66
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,473
-Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
-Drunk Lannisters.

67
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,728
-You've got a pretty voice.
-Thank you very much.

68
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,900
And I like your nose.
How many times you break it?

69
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,949
Now let's see. First time, I was five.

70
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,701
My mom smacked me with an iron poker.

71
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,915
It wasn't me she was aiming at.
She was trying for my little brother.

72
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,834
Now he was a real pest. Second time,

73
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,131
I was nine. Got in a scrap
with a few older boys.

74
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,217
They won.

75
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,761
Third time...

76
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,729
You don't wanna know about third time.

77
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,445
-Poor nose.
-Don't feel sorry for him.

78
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,864
He'll be halfway up your ass
before the night's through.

79
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,830
It's the last one.

80
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,253
Welcome, friends.

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,925
This round's on me.

82
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,395
I don't think he likes me.

83
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,660
You think you're a hard man?

84
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,997
I know it.

85
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,879
It's warm in here.

86
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,050
We've got beautiful women
and good brown ale.

87
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,052
Plenty for everyone.

88
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,807
And all you want is to put one of us
in the cold ground

89
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,268
with no women to keep us company.

90
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,606
There's women in the ground.
I put some there myself.

91
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,025
So have you.

92
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,322
You like fucking and drinking and singing.

93
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:03,371
But killing...
killing's the thing you love.

94
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,540
You're just like me.

95
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
Only smaller.

96
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
And quicker.

97
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,390
Your Lord lmp's going to miss you.

98
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,564
Aye...

99
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,444
I expect he will someday.

100
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,119
Here we are.

101
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,128
See you on the other side.

102
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,008
One more drink before the war? Shall we?

103
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,730
I've always hated the bells.

104
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,735
They ring for horror. A dead king,
a city under siege.

105
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,404
-A wedding.
-Exactly.

106
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,700
Podrick, is that it?

107
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,327
"Is that it?" Nice touch.

108
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,372
As if you don't know
the name of every boy in town.

109
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,584
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

110
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
what I'm suggesting.

111
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,047
Do you trust him?

112
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,178
Oddly enough, I do.

113
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,306
Good.

114
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,105
The map you asked for.

115
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,820
There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath this city.

116
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,530
Closer to 50.

117
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,992
The Targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege

118
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,871
and to provide escape if necessary.

119
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,334
I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of this ship,

120
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,629
-and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
-That is good to hear.

121
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,799
Though I'm sure many captains say
the same while their ship is afloat.

122
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,388
-You look well suited for battle, my lord.
-Well, I'm not.

123
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,308
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

124
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,522
My little birds tell me that
Stannis Baratheon has taken up

125
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,191
with the Red Priestess from Asshai.

126
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,400
What of it?

127
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,487
You don't believe in the old powers,
my lord?

128
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,241
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting?
What do you think?

129
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:52,790
I think you believe in what you see...
and in what those you trust have seen.

130
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,877
You probably don't entirely trust me.

131
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,839
Don't take it personally.
I don't entirely trust myself.

132
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,594
And yet I have seen things...
and heard things.

133
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,932
Things you have not.
Things I wish I had not.

134
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,230
I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.

135
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,025
No, I don't believe you have.

136
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,029
One day I will.

137
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,660
The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis
with his armies

138
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,288
and paved his path to our door.

139
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,709
For a man in service to such powers
to sit on the Iron Throne,

140
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,336
I can think of nothing worse.

141
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,968
And tonight, I believe you are
the only man who can stop him.

142
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,583
-They're welcoming the new king.
-I've never known bells to mean surrender.

143
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,920
They want to play music with us?
Let's play. Drums.

144
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,381
Drums!

145
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,534
-Remember, wait until the ships--
-The ships are in the bay.

146
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,911
They must be far enough in

147
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,663
-so they won't be--
-I know what "in" means.

148
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,374
-Do you know how to use that?
-I chopped wood once.

149
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

150
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,171
I saw you kill a man with a shield.
You'll be unstoppable with an axe.

151
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,050
-Don't get killed.
-Nor you, my friend.

152
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,428
-Oh, are we friends now?
-Of course we are.

153
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,682
Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.

154
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,433
Enhances it, really.

155
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,311
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.

156
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,146
Been spending time with fancy folks.

157
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,078
Lady Sansa and Sheila.

158
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,123
-Shae.
-Shae, yes.

159
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,209
Surely my sister has asked you to join
the other highborn ladies

160
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,585
in Maegor's Holdfest?

161
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,880
She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent
for me to see him off.

162
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,508
Sansa!

163
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,468
Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

164
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,803
Sansa, come here!

165
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,599
I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

166
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,478
-Will you?
-Just as I pray for the king's.

167
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,944
-Stay safe, my lady.
-And you, my lion.

168
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:20,038
Your king rides forth to battle.
You should see him off with a kiss.

169
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,543
My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it.

170
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,672
Kiss it.

171
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,686
You'll kiss it again when I return
and taste my uncle's blood.

172
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,062
Will you slay him yourself?

173
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,566
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

174
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,778
So, you'll be outside the gates fighting
in the vanguard?

175
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,866
A king doesn't discuss battle plans
with stupid girls.

176
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,911
I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right.
I'm stupid.

177
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,746
Of course you'll be in the vanguard.

178
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,875
They say my brother Robb always goes
where the fighting is the thickest.

179
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,545
-And he's only a pretender.
-Your brother's turn will come.

180
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,216
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

181
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,314
Some of those boys will never come back.

182
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,276
Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.

183
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,530
Come, my lady.

184
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,621
-Where's our fleet?
-On the way.

185
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,541
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

186
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,754
Hound, tell the Hand that
his king has asked him a question.

187
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,382
The king has asked you a question.

188
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,887
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell
the king that the Hand is extremely busy.

189
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,848
The Hand of the King would like me
to tell you to tell the king--

190
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,226
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.

191
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,855
That would make me the Quarter Man.
Just doesn't have the same ring to it.

192
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,901
Cut me in half and I won't be able
to give the signal.

193
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,611
No signal, no plan.

194
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,031
No plan, and Stannis Baratheon
sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne,

195
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,326
puts your pinched little head
atop a gate somewhere.

196
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,496
It might be quite amusing.
Except that my head'll be up there, too.

197
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,290
I've never much liked my head,

198
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,126
but I don't want to see it removed
just yet.

199
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,048
Where are their ships?

200
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,967
It is wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

201
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,095
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

202
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,805
There are no surprises here.

203
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,766
If it's true there's dissention
in their ranks,

204
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,061
-maybe their sailors have mutinied.
-Maybe.

205
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,412
I don't know why she wants me here.

206
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,958
She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.

207
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,627
Maybe she hates you less
than she hates everyone else.

208
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,296
I doubt it.

209
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,385
-Maybe she's jealous of you.
-Why would she be jealous?

210
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,303
Sansa?

211
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,601
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

212
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,315
You look pale, child.
Is your red flower still blooming?

213
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,944
-Yes.
-Fitting, isn't it?

214
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,531
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

215
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,285
-Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
-I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

216
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,871
So? I didn't offer you water.

217
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,921
-What's he doing here?
-Ser Ilyn?

218
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,716
He's here to defend us.

219
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,970
When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.

220
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,598
-But we have guards to defend us.
-Guards we have paid.

221
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,436
Should the city fall, they'll be
the first ones out of the doors.

222
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,693
The lads caught a groom and two maids
trying to sneak away with a stolen horse

223
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,736
and some gold cups.

224
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,323
The battle's first traitors.
Have Ser Ilyn see to them.

225
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,869
Put their heads on spikes
outside the stables as a warning.

226
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,166
The only way to keep the small folk loyal
is to make certain

227
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,543
they fear you more than they do the enemy.

228
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,672
Remember that... if you ever hope
to become a queen.

229
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,426
You said he was here to protect us.

230
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,305
He is.

231
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,058
Traitors are a danger to us all.

232
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,101
More wine.

233
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,326
There they are.

234
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:57,209
-Archers to their marks!
-Archers! To your marks!

235
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,962
Archers!

236
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,555
-Nock your arrows!
-Nock arrows!

237
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,184
-Hold fast!
-Hold fast!

238
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,853
What are you doing?
We need to attack them!

239
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,773
-Hold fast.
-Boulders ready!

240
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,776
Hold fast!

241
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,197
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

242
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,492
Where are the rest of them?

243
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,665
There's only one ship.

244
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,712
Archers, stand to!

245
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,424
-Man the below! Nock!
-Nock and set!

246
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,010
Draw!

247
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,644
-Hold!
-Hold!

248
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,863
There's no one onboard.

249
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,163
More rocks coming up!

250
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,181
Hold.

251
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,358
-Wildfire.
-Steer clear! Steer clear!

252
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,344
Matthos! Get down!

253
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,982
-Prepare to land.
-Your Grace.

254
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,984
The dwarf has played his little trick.

255
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,778
-The wildfire.
-He can only play it once.

256
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,405
We're too far from the gates.

257
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,909
The fire, their archers.
Hundreds will die.

258
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,038
Thousands.

259
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,346
Come with me and take this city!

260
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,908
Sansa, come here, little dove.

261
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,332
My queen.

262
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,877
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

263
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,173
You're perfect, aren't you? Praying.

264
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,053
-What are you praying for?
-For the Gods to have mercy on us all.

265
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
-On all of us?
-Yes, Your Grace.

266
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,811
-Even me?
-Of course, Your Grace.

267
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,896
Even Joffrey?

268
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,734
-Joffrey is my--
-Oh, shut up, little fool.

269
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,946
Praying to the Gods to have mercy
on us all.

270
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,865
The Gods have no mercy.
That's why they're Gods.

271
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,786
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

272
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,623
My mother had just died, you see.

273
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,710
I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

274
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,339
I thought that if I prayed very,
very hard,

275
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,759
the Gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.

276
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,178
Your father doesn't believe in the Gods?

277
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,681
He believes in them.
He just doesn't like them very much.

278
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,477
One for her.

279
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,941
Here.

280
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,487
Sit. Drink.

281
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,243
Not like that. Drink, girl.

282
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,248
I should have been born a man.

283
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,251
I'd rather face a thousand swords

284
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,713
than be shut up inside with this flock
of frightened hens.

285
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,466
They are your guests
under your protection.

286
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,011
-You asked them here.
-It was expected of me,

287
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,306
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

288
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,477
If my retched brother should
somehow prevail,

289
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,813
these hens will return to their cocks

290
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:39,486
and crow of how my courage inspired them,
lifted their spirits.

291
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,446
And if the city should fall?

292
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,658
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

293
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,661
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

294
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:53,374
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

295
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,336
If it were anyone else
outside those gates,

296
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,465
I might have hoped for a private audience,
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

297
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,093
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his whores.

298
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,390
Have I shocked you, little dove?

299
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,977
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

300
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,067
The best one's between your legs.
Learn how to use it.

301
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,194
Drink.

302
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,992
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

303
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,454
No, you wouldn't, would you?

304
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:38,962
If the city falls, these fine women...
should be in for a bit of a rape.

305
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,716
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

306
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,678
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

307
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,016
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

308
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,605
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

309
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,194
A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

310
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
More pressure!

311
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,788
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

312
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,999
That's it, men!

313
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,170
-That's it, men!
-Pull!

314
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,965
Pull! Pull!

315
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,055
He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

316
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,725
They're coming. They're coming ashore.

317
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,769
Rain fire on them.

318
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,522
-Archers!
-There are too many.

319
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,774
Hound, form a welcome party

320
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,611
for any Baratheon troop that manages
to touch solid ground.

321
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:52,201
Pod, run to the King's Gate.
Bring any men guarding it here, now!

322
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,453
Yes, my lord.

323
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,457
Let's go. Stannis is sending us
fresh meat.

324
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,042
You too.

325
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,796
Any of these flaming fucking arrows
come near me,

326
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,715
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

327
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,598
Pull, pull! Go!

328
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,807
Nock!

329
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,646
Draw!

330
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,149
Draw!

331
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,411
Loose!

332
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,246
Loose!

333
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,675
-Draw!
-Draw!

334
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,802
-Loose!
-Loose!

335
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,306
To the Mud Gate! Go now!

336
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,810
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the Mud Gate!

337
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,981
Any man dies with a clean sword,
I'll rape his fucking corpse!

338
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,895
When we were young, Jaime and I,
we looked so much alike

339
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,605
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

340
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,484
I could never understand
why they treated us differently.

341
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,697
Jamie was taught to fight with sword
and lance and mace

342
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,327
and I was taught to smile and sing
and please.

343
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,829
He was heir to Casterly Rock,

344
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,918
and I was sold to some stranger like
a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.

345
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:52,173
-You were Robert's queen.
-And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

346
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,970
I don't think I know this one.

347
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,186
Pretty.

348
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,861
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

349
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,823
Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it
when I was four.

350
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,158
Straighten your back and bend.

351
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,372
Better. You learn fast.

352
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,708
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

353
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,712
A few weeks, Your Grace.

354
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,384
And when did you leave Lorath?

355
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,888
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

356
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,144
But she was a nobleman's daughter.
You're not.

357
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,150
When did you come to Westeros?

358
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,362
Ten years ago, Your Grace.

359
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,576
From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
in ten years,

360
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,744
all without learning how to curtsy.

361
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,415
I imagine that's a very interesting story.

362
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,919
-What's your name?
-Shae, Your Grace.

363
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,213
Tell us a story, Shae.

364
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,263
When I was 13, I--

365
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,643
-Your Grace!
-What news?

366
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,691
The Imp has set the river on fire.
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

367
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,152
Stannis' fleet destroyed, but...

368
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,658
But... his troops have landed
outside the city walls.

369
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,535
Where is Joffrey?

370
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,204
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

371
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,373
Bring him back inside at once.

372
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,084
-Your Grace!
-What?

373
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,340
-The king's presence is good for morale.
-Bring him back to his chambers now.

374
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,051
-Not here?
-With the women and children?

375
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,553
Do you want him to be mocked
as a coward for the rest of his life?

376
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,221
-No, but I--
-Now!

377
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,605
When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier,
I lied.

378
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,527
Do you want to hear the truth?
Do you want to know why he's really here?

379
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,784
He's here for us.
Stannis may take the city,

380
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,912
he may take the throne,
but he will not take us alive.

381
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,063
Get the ladders up!

382
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,308
Faster, you bastards! Faster!

383
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,518
Come on! Kill the scum!

384
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,813
Someone bring me a drink.

385
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,198
Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

386
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,505
Can I get you some iced milk
and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

387
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,759
-Eat shit, dwarf.
-You're on the wrong side of the wall.

388
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,511
I lost half of my men.

389
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,264
The Blackwater's on fire.

390
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,102
Dog, I command you to go
back out there and fight!

391
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,148
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

392
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,402
We must beat them back
or they're going to take this city.

393
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,153
Your king's city.

394
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,698
Fuck the Kingsguard.

395
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,660
Fuck the city.

396
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,454
Fuck the king.

397
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,607
Loose!

398
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,612
Loose!

399
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,018
They're coming up the wall!

400
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:26,150
Heave! Heave! Heave!

401
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,905
Your Grace! The queen has sent me
to bring you back to the Red Keep.

402
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,993
If you won't defend your own city,
why should they?

403
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,787
-What would you have me do?
-Lead!

404
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,832
Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders

405
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,958
who want to kill them!

406
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,462
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?

407
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
She did not say, Your Grace.

408
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,092
-All men to the battlements!
-Heave!

409
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,554
Ser Boros, Ser Mandon.

410
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,766
Stay with my uncle and represent the king
on the field of battle.

411
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,813
Archers, hold your line
or I'll kill you myself.

412
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,786
No!

413
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,832
Get up, you fool!

414
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,417
We need more arrows!

415
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,005
Where's the king?

416
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,509
-Why isn't he with us?
-Who are we fighting for?

417
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:36,929
Who leads us?

418
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,389
I'll lead the attack.

419
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,849
I'll lead the attack!

420
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,063
-What are you talking about?
-Pod, my helmet.

421
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,403
Ser Mandon, you will bear
the king's banner. Men, form up!

422
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,031
Men...

423
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,576
Men!

424
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,911
They say I'm half a man.

425
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,998
But what does that make the lot of you?

426
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,003
The only way out is through the gates
and they're at the gates!

427
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,463
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

428
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their asses!

429
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,394
Don't fight for your king,
and don't fight for his kingdoms!

430
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,440
Don't fight for honor!
Don't fight for glory!

431
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,026
Don't fight for riches
because you won't get any.

432
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:36,697
This is your city Stannis means to sack.
That's your gate he's ramming!

433
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,367
If he gets in,
it will be your houses he burns,

434
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,955
your gold he steals,
your women he'll rape.

435
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:52,421
Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!

436
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,675
Those are brave men knocking at our door.

437
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,928
Let's go kill them!

438
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,869
The battle is lost, Your Grace.

439
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,956
Stannis' troops are at the gates.

440
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:32,544
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,
they lost all heart.

441
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,590
-Where is my son?
-I want to escort him back to the battle.

442
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,550
Why do I care what you want?

443
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,136
-Bring me--
-Now listen to me. We--

444
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,812
Don't be afraid.

445
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,649
The queen has raised the drawbridge.
This is the safest place we can be.

446
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,402
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

447
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,114
His knights have rallied behind him.
They will save the city.

448
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,574
Should we sing a hymn?

449
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:08,288
Gentle mother, font of mercy

450
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,668
Save our sons from war, we pray

451
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,044
Gentle...

452
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:18,549
You must go. Run to your chamber
and bar your door.

453
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,677
Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

454
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,599
-Come with me.
-I need to say goodbye to someone.

455
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,437
-The queen said they'd rape everyone.
-No one is raping me.

456
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,232
Go. Run!

457
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:40,946
...font of mercy
Save our sons from war, we pray

458
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,356
The ladies starting to panic?

459
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,944
-What are you doing here?
-Not here for long.

460
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,780
-I'm going.
-Where?

461
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,159
Someplace that isn't burning.

462
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,289
North might be. Could be.

463
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,042
What about the king?

464
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,837
He can die just fine on his own.

465
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,637
I can take you with me.

466
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,681
Take you to Winterfell.

467
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,688
I'll keep you safe.

468
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,193
Do you want to go home?

469
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,242
I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.

470
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,453
Look at me.

471
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,040
Stannis is a killer.

472
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,793
The Lannisters are killers.

473
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:23,048
Your father was a killer.
Your brother is a killer.

474
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,802
Your sons will be killers someday.

475
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,306
The world is built by killers.

476
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,604
So you better get used to looking at them.

477
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,318
You won't hurt me.

478
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,452
No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

479
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,353
Heaνe!

480
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,445
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

481
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,034
Attack!

482
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,966
Roll it over!

483
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,894
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

484
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:03,148
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

485
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:08,904
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

486
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,948
Oh, fuck me.

487
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,172
-Be calm, my sweet.
-They're still fighting.

488
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,218
No one's going to hurt you.

489
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,141
I'll tell you a story.

490
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,145
You know the one about the mother lion
and her little cub?

491
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,230
They lived in the woods.

492
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,691
-The Kingswood?
-Yes, my love.

493
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:33,989
In the Kingswood, there lived a mother
and her cub. She loved him very much.

494
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,035
But there were other things that lived
in the woods, evil things.

495
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,537
Like what?

496
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,541
Like stags.

497
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,545
Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.

498
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,132
-And wolves.
-My lord.

499
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,470
He could hear them howling in the night.
Little cub was frightened.

500
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,892
His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid."

501
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,115
"For one day, all the beasts
will bow to you."

502
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,242
"You will be king."

503
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,331
"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow."

504
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,543
"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south."

505
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,465
"All the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea."

506
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,345
"They will all come to you, little lion,

507
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,723
to rest a crown upon your head."

508
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:52,025
And the cub said, "Will I be strong
and fierce like my father?"

509
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,570
"Yes," said his mother.

510
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,199
"You will be strong and fierce,
just like your father."
