1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,956
Cactus 1549.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,698
Runway four. Cleared for takeoff.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,614
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,370
Mayday, mayday. Cactus 1549.

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,054
We've lost both engines. Both engines.

6
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,059
No relight on one or two.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,556
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,218
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,596
Departure control, we can make it.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,850
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,095
LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,773
Sully, we're too low.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,453
Sully, we're too low!

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,814
Come on.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,740
Just a little farther.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,693
Come on.

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Sully!

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,454
Lorrie, I love you.

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,496
What the hell's the matter with you?

20
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,099
The on board count, 150 passengers,

21
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,455
three flight attendants
and two pilots, one of whom,

22
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,498
the senior pilot, drew on
all of his experience and skill,

23
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,055
which combined with
near-miraculous good luck

24
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,972
and a result that was,
frankly, astounding.

25
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,937
There were some non-critical injuries,

26
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,179
but everyone, everyone, survived.

27
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,457
The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...

28
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,930
You think that you're gonna die.
That's what you think.

29
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,660
And then, miraculously, you don't.

30
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,693
Thank you, Captain.

31
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,449
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,737
Okay, thank you,
everybody, thank you.

33
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,060
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

34
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,256
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

35
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,956
I'm glad you could make it in
this morning.

36
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,891
Not as glad as we are.

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,116
For the record,
we had an Aircraft Systems Team

38
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
on this investigation.

39
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,972
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT,

40
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,017
Aircraft Performance, ATC,

41
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,138
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

42
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,929
Today, we begin with our operation
and human performance investigation

43
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,375
on the crash of US Airways Flight 1549.

44
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,770
- Water landing.
- Captain?

45
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,771
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

46
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,049
We knew what we were
trying to execute here.

47
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,255
It was not a...

48
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,536
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

49
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,540
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

50
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,491
There simply was not enough altitude.

51
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,340
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,820
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

53
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,020
Air Traffic testified

54
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,020
that you stated
you were returning to LaGuardia,

55
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,652
but you did not.

56
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,492
As I began the left turn,

57
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,128
I realized I couldn't make it back

58
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,236
and it would have eliminated
all the other options.

59
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,180
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,836
Okay, well, let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

61
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,220
There was no time for calculating.

62
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,732
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude and speed

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,970
of thousands of flights over four decades.

64
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,716
You're saying you didn't do any...

65
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,219
I eyeballed it.

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,531
You eyeballed it?

67
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,573
Yes.

68
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,698
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,734
And I'd bet my life on it.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,174
In fact, I did.

71
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,093
And I would do it again.

72
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,057
Aviation engineers are theorizing

73
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,256
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

74
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,895
Well, engineers are not pilots.

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,698
They're wrong.

76
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,619
And they weren't there.

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,236
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications

78
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,852
as part of our investigation.

79
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,534
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

80
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,260
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

81
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,297
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

82
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,690
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

83
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,169
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

84
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,020
Not possible during an investigation.

85
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,655
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,135
due to multiple bird strikes?

87
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,131
That would be unprecedented.

88
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,573
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

89
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,620
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

90
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,139
Eight hours. Enough.

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,018
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

92
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,058
I was rested, alert
and completely aware of my surroundings.

93
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,396
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

94
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,420
Nine days ago.

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Drugs?

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
No. Never.

97
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,259
First Officer Skiles?

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,411
Uh, don't drink. Never have.

99
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,694
Captain, have you had
any troubles at home lately?

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,893
No more than anyone else.

101
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,096
And nothing that affected my work.

102
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,857
It's bullshit.

103
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,490
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

104
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,916
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

105
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,214
and their insurance company.

106
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,098
We should expect some blowback.

107
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,276
Come on, Mike. What are they gonna say?
That he shouldn't have saved everybody?

108
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,939
It's not personal.
NTSB's just doing its job.

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,978
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

110
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,289
Sully,

111
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,577
they should pin on the medal
and send you back to work.

112
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,276
Sorry. This mailbox is full.

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,451
I didn't call Lorrie since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

114
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,012
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say,

115
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,136
it is an honor driving you today.

116
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,893
Thank you.

117
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,778
What has it been this year so far?

118
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,575
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.
Many million new people with no work.

119
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,975
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

120
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,969
Friday's headline? This is beautiful.

121
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,498
Hey, Mike. How about we add
the driver as a character witness?

122
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,575
Finally!

123
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,332
Yeah, finally.

124
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,775
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

125
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,529
I know.

126
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,693
I just needed to hear your voice.

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,532
I've been hearing everybody else's.

128
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,975
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

129
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,371
It doesn't feel much like family here.

130
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,651
Pretty quiet here, too.

131
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,853
The reporters want me to give an update
inside the mind of Sully.

132
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,374
What should I tell them?

133
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,276
Lorrie, tell them you're not
allowed to talk to anybody.

134
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,892
- Look, I can't hear you.
- Lorrie, I...

135
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,116
- I can't hear you. Call me back.
- I'm trying to tell you

136
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,356
you do not have to talk to anybody.

137
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,018
I can't hear you. Call me back.

138
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,898
Lorrie, I'm trying to tell...

139
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,036
Hey, Captain Sully!

140
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,780
- Captain Sully!
- Sully!

141
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,116
How does it feel to be a miracle maker?

142
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,414
Sully, one question!

143
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,796
- How did you pull off the impossible?
- Sully!

144
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,015
Captain Sully! Sully!

145
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,295
Pardon me.

146
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,940
Captain Sully!

147
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,436
I'm thinking about
running over the press with the car.

148
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,610
Self-defense.
You think a jury would convict?

149
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,180
Just do what you have to do.

150
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,292
You know, I'm taking that as permission.
The cops'll be coming after you.

151
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,098
Sullenberger couldn't be here.

152
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,291
He is not able to speak to the media

153
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,089
while the NTSB
is conducting its investigation.

154
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,611
Sully, are you listening to me?

155
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,896
Maybe we should talk later.

156
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,096
Honey, it is later.
I've been waiting all day.

157
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,409
Are you okay?

158
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,810
Yeah, just tired, that's all.

159
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,493
How are the girls?

160
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Well, they're...

161
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,570
They're a little overwhelmed.
It sounds like you are, too.

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Yeah...

163
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,972
Yeah, well, they'll be all right.

164
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,255
It is a lot.

165
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,688
Yes, it is.

166
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,956
Those missing engines

167
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,860
were definitely not
what investigators wanted...

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,411
The whole world is talking about you.

169
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,894
My Sully.

170
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,972
God, I just can't believe this.

171
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,172
Lorrie, I have to stay here longer

172
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,012
for the NTSB investigation.

173
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,968
Did I tell you that already?
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

174
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,659
There is no need for you to apologize.
You are right where you need to be.

175
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,132
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

176
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,978
Of course you did. You saved everyone.

177
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,658
Uh, maybe we should
just talk in the morning. I'm tired.

178
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,414
I'm overwhelmed by all this attention.

179
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,853
I'm gonna be on TV in the morning.

180
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,900
What are they gonna ask me?
What am I gonna say?

181
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,176
Sully, do you want me to come be with you?

182
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,258
No, Lorrie.

183
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,856
Thanks, but the girls need you.

184
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,333
Tell them I love them.

185
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,649
I love you. Get some sleep.

186
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,409
Yeah.

187
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,014
Hey, maybe when I wake up,
it'll be January 14th.

188
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,329
Wouldn't that be good?

189
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,739
I love you.

190
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,931
Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision

191
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,614
to turn the Hudson into a runway?

192
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,418
Well, only he can answer.

193
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,209
But we now know it was the wrong choice.

194
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,454
A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those on board.

195
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,374
So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero,

196
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,577
this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding

197
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,135
of the so-called "Miracle on the Hudson."

198
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,215
Sully Sullenberger,
are you a hero or a fraud?

199
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,052
- Hello?
- Jeff?

200
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,773
I'm sorry to call so late.

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,295
It's okay.
There's no sleep in this room either.

202
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,293
Can you believe they charge
$5 for a Snickers?

203
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,140
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

204
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,011
Just thought
maybe you would want to, uh...

205
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Talk?

206
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,693
Absolutely.

207
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,772
Let's get some air.

208
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,495
Great.

209
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,296
All right. Be down there in five minutes.

210
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,818
You enjoying the shakes?

211
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,258
The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.

212
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
A little bit.

213
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,417
Union's offering us counseling.

214
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,611
Yeah. What are they gonna say?

215
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,817
"You were in a plane crash and lived."

216
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,369
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

217
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,778
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

218
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,976
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,580
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing

220
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,776
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

221
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,211
We're doing David Letterman?

222
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,450
Yeah. Right after the next NTSB interview.

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Letterman.

224
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,369
I'm guessing Dave
is gonna be slightly funnier.

225
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,808
This is so surreal.

226
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,858
I guess I'm having a little trouble

227
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,818
separating reality
from whatever the hell this is.

228
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,129
Yeah.

229
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,495
This is two men freezing their asses off.

230
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,175
Sully.

231
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,656
Don't worry. You did a great thing.

232
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,970
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

233
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,852
Here's the funny thing.

234
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,330
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air,

235
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,179
but in the end,
I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

236
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,296
Come on. Tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

237
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,250
Computer sims will prove you were right.
We can all put our wings back on.

238
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,773
You wanna run?

239
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,168
Yeah, let's run.

240
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,738
Fucking cold out here.

241
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,853
It was obvious.

242
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,419
It was a critical situation,

243
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,013
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

244
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,373
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

245
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,695
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

246
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,451
I was sure I could do it.

247
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,054
You were?

248
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,614
Yes.

249
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,292
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

250
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,535
I don't feel like a hero.

251
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,050
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

252
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,974
The right man for the job
at the right time.

253
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,890
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

254
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Forty-two. It's been my life.

255
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,857
My whole life.

256
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,093
Your aircraft.

257
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,613
My aircraft.

258
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,610
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

259
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,419
So, you can take the plane up, I guess,
when you please.

260
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,740
Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

261
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,374
A pilot never stops acquiring knowledge.

262
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,454
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

263
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,939
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,928
And never forget,
no matter what's happening,

265
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,613
to fly the airplane.

266
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,895
Absolutely, sir.

267
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,377
Oh, one other thing,
and this is important.

268
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,849
- Sir?
- You can go ahead and smile.

269
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,495
All right.

270
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,460
- I apologize for the perspiration.
- Oh, no.

271
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
After what you did,

272
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,940
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

273
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,174
Oh, it wasn't Katie.

274
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,298
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

275
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,253
Okay. All done.

276
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,530
That was from my mom.

277
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,809
Her name is Brenda,

278
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,733
she says to say "thank you"
and that she's single.

279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,331
Well, you tell Brenda thank you,
but I've got a girl at home.

280
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,537
- Lucky woman.
- Thank you.

281
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,779
Sully.

282
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,010
Sully. Sully!

283
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,732
Sully, where are you?

284
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,291
I'm standing here calling your name.

285
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,973
What's up with you?

286
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,138
You need to get focused.

287
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,379
Because the media request
avalanche continues.

288
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,768
Yeah. Yeah.

289
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,260
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in

290
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,416
and ride shotgun with you
the rest of the way.

291
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,738
Thought you might need a friend.

292
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,050
He'll take you to today's NTSB meeting.

293
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,419
Airbus completed their
computer simulations as well.

294
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,491
Good. Good, that'll help.

295
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,697
There's something else.
Arnie Gentile called.

296
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,739
He has the ACARS data.

297
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,255
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

298
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,413
Not possible. I felt it go.

299
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,332
It was like we were stopped in midair.

300
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,014
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle,

301
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,977
that it still could've had thrust.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,937
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

303
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,893
Is retirement next?

304
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,859
What's next for you? What's next?

305
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,609
Some room, please.

306
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,299
Sully! Over here!

307
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,015
Hey, Larry. Good to see a friendly face.

308
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,411
Might be the last one you see today.

309
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,716
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

310
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,196
Look,
I'm sorry if you're frustrated,

311
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,257
but our job is to investigate
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

312
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,092
On the Hudson River.

313
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,939
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

314
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,614
Seeking the facts
is hardly "fishing," Mr. Skiles.

315
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,356
Okay,
then here's the most important fact.

316
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,876
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day

317
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
and I'm one of them.

318
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,460
And we appreciate your perspective.

319
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,416
Why do you even think we're here today?

320
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,089
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

321
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,813
Look, I just finished training on the A320
and I can tell you,

322
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,956
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did,

323
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,538
that the aircraft could land anywhere,

324
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,460
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

325
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,616
He was simply following the QRH.

326
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,259
No. No, he wasn't.

327
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,217
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

328
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,575
And I know, because
I had the QRH in my hands.

329
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,654
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

330
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,651
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

331
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,139
Fifteenth.

332
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,980
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

333
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,892
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

334
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,096
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

335
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,938
Look, what Jeff is saying

336
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,252
is that I know the A320,
what it does and what it doesn't do.

337
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,174
I have read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots

338
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,900
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

339
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,331
There is no question

340
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,732
that you are a talented, dedicated,
experienced professional.

341
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,454
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

342
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,976
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

343
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,134
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

344
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,698
Your union has been advised.

345
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,373
ACARS data relayed that the left engine

346
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,411
continued to turn throughout the flight.

347
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,178
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

348
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,012
The evidence shows that the left engine

349
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,456
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird strike.

350
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,976
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

351
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,372
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

352
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,735
But we can circle back to that later.

353
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,778
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say,

354
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,448
a dual engine loss due to bird strike.

355
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,578
Your weight was 151,510 pounds,

356
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,774
wind and temperature
north, northwest, 21°.

357
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,171
Speed and altitude
200 knots at 2,818 feet.

358
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,379
- Agree?
- Correct.

359
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,756
We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

360
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,217
And the resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

361
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,178
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

362
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,539
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike

363
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,055
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

364
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,975
Successful?

365
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,495
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

366
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,975
Intact.

367
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,048
Undamaged.

368
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,256
You got that from one computer simulation?

369
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,455
No.

370
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
From 20.

371
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,290
Including attempts made for
Teterboro runways 1-9

372
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,770
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

373
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,615
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

374
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,210
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

375
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,972
And not just possible, probable.

376
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,128
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

377
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,458
Captain Sullenberger?

378
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,888
First Officer Skiles?

379
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,852
Not at this time.

380
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,853
I would like to go over
the parameters that were used.

381
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,498
We will make them available to the union.

382
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Thank you.

383
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,617
Once the investigation is complete,

384
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,533
we'll be able to share
the actual computer simulations.

385
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,531
For now, they remain confidential.

386
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,577
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

387
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,494
There's been far too much talk
in the press already.

388
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,698
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled,

389
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,057
along with ATC
and all on board transcripts combined,

390
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,219
we will call you back.

391
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,577
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

392
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,214
Thank you.

393
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,808
They're playing Pacman.

394
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,580
You were flying a plane
full of human beings.

395
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,690
Somehow, that's not how I remember it.

396
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,659
It just doesn't seem right.

397
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,851
It's because it's not right.

398
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,540
Sully, you did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

399
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,819
Ask the passengers.

400
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,255
Ask your wife and kids. Ask mine.

401
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,651
So what was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

402
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,776
- "Brace for impact." Yes.
- "Brace for impact."

403
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,860
Now, uh, ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

404
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,299
No, not ever.

405
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,419
Ever hear that in any other
aspect of your lives?

406
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,208
I don't know.

407
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,338
I don't know.

408
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,814
They could take this show away from me.

409
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,650
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

410
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,196
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

411
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,300
Are they paying you

412
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,253
for all this media stuff at least?

413
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,933
It's news, Lorr.

414
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,698
No payment is necessary.

415
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,691
Oh, I wish the bank felt the same way.

416
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,253
Why? What do you mean?

417
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,648
It's just...

418
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,409
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

419
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,614
We'll find a tenant.

420
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,929
It just takes time.

421
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,876
Yeah, you've been saying that
for nine months, Sully.

422
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,969
It's still vacant.

423
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,812
The economy has to take a turn.

424
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,055
It feels like if we lose that space,
the next domino to fall is the house.

425
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,089
Lorr, we're not gonna lose the house.

426
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,574
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,379
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,172
I'm just anxious

429
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,969
and I'm alone and not enough sleep.

430
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Yeah, I know.

431
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,690
Not a lot of sleep going on here either.

432
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,691
I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress.

433
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,249
But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon.

434
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,732
Not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

435
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,899
We need you flying.

436
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,018
Lorr, if this goes badly,

437
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,174
my career as a safety expert
will end as a website and a business card.

438
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,615
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

439
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,691
What if I did blow this?

440
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,738
What are you saying?

441
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,249
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

442
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,296
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

443
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,450
Sully, watch the news. You're a hero.

444
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,214
Everyone's gonna have to get used to it,
including the NTSB.

445
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,372
Worst case scenario,

446
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,259
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

447
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,059
That's immediate retirement. No pension.

448
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,775
My life's work gone.

449
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,057
Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.
What is going on?

450
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,096
The left engine might have
still been idling.

451
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,972
And the Airbus simulations say

452
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,098
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

453
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,298
But that doesn't make sense.

454
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,739
Doesn't jibe with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

455
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,610
Then why did you do it, Sully?

456
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,572
What, land in the water?

457
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,014
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

458
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,774
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

459
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,010
The, uh, tuna basil
or the ham and cheddar?

460
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,648
Tuna basil, Mr. Sully. Very fresh.

461
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,171
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

462
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,296
Too cold today. Too much cold.

463
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,809
When are you gonna come fly with me?

464
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,932
When US Air starts flights to Hyderabad.

465
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,610
I will talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.

466
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,690
- Oh, for heaven's sakes, Diane!
- No!

467
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,532
- It's his birthday!
- Come on! No, Mom!

468
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,133
Just a little something.

469
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,500
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

470
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,620
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

471
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,612
Feels like you've traveled, too.

472
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,538
Ma, he's turning one.

473
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,453
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

474
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,019
But I will.

475
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,057
Maybe a snow globe.

476
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,734
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

477
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,130
Were you this generous when we were kids?

478
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,494
Okay, sweetheart.

479
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,969
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

480
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,138
Fine. Come on.

481
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,700
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

482
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,339
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

483
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,456
- Jeff.
- Hey, Sully. How are ya?

484
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,494
Hey, guys! Jeff!

485
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,849
We're not gonna make it!

486
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,316
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

487
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,716
I'm not gonna miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

488
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,380
We'll see you there, Uncle Robbie.

489
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,055
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

490
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,370
3-0-2-3.

491
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,537
Start checklist complete.

492
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,976
You really think they'll release us?

493
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,980
I've checked the latest reports.

494
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,500
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

495
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,369
Then steaks.

496
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,258
Del Frisco's. On me.

497
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,899
Never been.

498
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,369
And I hear good things.

499
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,338
The rib eye'll break your heart.

500
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,053
I'm more of a porterhouse man.

501
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,015
The porterhouse will stop your heart.

502
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,940
We are now closed
for US Airways flight 1549,

503
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
service to Charlotte...

504
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Wait, wait!

505
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,780
- You got it.
- Wait, wait, wait!

506
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,209
Hi. I'm sorry.

507
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,059
Um, Spirit sent us.

508
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,196
We got canceled and they said
that we were re-routed.

509
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,539
That you guys had some seats?

510
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,735
Flight is closed.

511
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,414
Wait, see that old guy
limping up right there?

512
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,876
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's gotta be on this flight.

513
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,572
What kind of emergency?

514
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,379
- Golf emergency.
- This flight canceled?

515
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,893
Oughta be.

516
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,418
- ID's please.
- Oh, my God!

517
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,716
How many people are traveling?

518
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,889
Three. Thank you.

519
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,573
Nothing together.

520
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,500
That's all right.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

521
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,936
Here we go.

522
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,374
22A,

523
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,575
6A

524
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,208
And 6C.

525
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,916
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

526
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
Thank you.

527
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,216
- Yes! What!
- Happy ending.

528
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,088
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard!

529
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,454
- Ahoy.
- Welcome aboard.

530
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,756
- How's it going?
- Lucky you made it.

531
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,054
- Yeah, no kidding.
- All right.

532
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,460
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Thank you!

533
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,775
- We're in six, Jeff.
- Oh, no. That's all Jimmy.

534
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
I was up till 3:00.
I gotta get some sleep.

535
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,008
You can sleep here.

536
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,116
Not with you verbally running
the course the whole time.

537
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,996
"I think I'll play
the seven iron on the 9th."

538
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,373
No. Good night.

539
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,818
Sorry. Excuse me.

540
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,812
Here. There you go.

541
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,618
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

542
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,613
Hey, guys, I'm in here.

543
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,889
I'm so sorry.

544
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,288
He likes to throw everything.

545
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,451
That's perfect.
I like to catch everything.

546
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,733
Hey, little man.

547
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,659
I googled you last night.

548
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,417
Read all about your company
on your website.

549
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,809
It's impressive.

550
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
Thanks.

551
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,457
I thought I was
a good bullshitter, but you?

552
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,009
You could go pro.

553
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
Hey.

554
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,978
Oh, I'm only teasing.

555
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,260
The site does make it sound

556
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,140
like your air safety consulting business
has got about 100 employees

557
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,217
and headquarters in three states.

558
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,733
Then when I dug a little deeper,

559
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,329
I realized it's only you.

560
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,539
Go easy.

561
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,696
I'm just getting it going.

562
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

563
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,851
Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

564
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,853
Off that website? I'd hire you.

565
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,011
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,410
Welcome on board US Airways Flight 1549

567
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,933
with service to Charlotte.

568
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,300
Please review the safety instruction card
in the seatback pocket in front of you.

569
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,689
It explains the safety features
of this aircraft

570
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,136
as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices.

571
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,860
Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device.

572
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,291
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

573
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,596
Cactus 1549, gate 21 cleared to push.

574
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,973
Spot 28, ground for taxi.

575
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,212
Be sure you turn that off.

576
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,893
Tray table up.

577
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,250
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

578
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,248
Well, you know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

579
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,614
Yeah, what's that?

580
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,930
Fly out of JFK.

581
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Funny.

582
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,576
Takeoff minimum fuel quantity verify.

583
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
19, 000 pounds required.

584
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,259
We got 21.8 on board.

585
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,139
19,000 pounds required. 21.8 on board.

586
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,337
Cactus 1549.
Runway 4. Cleared for takeoff.

587
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,090
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

588
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,933
TO/GA.

589
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,453
TO/GA set.

590
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,255
Positive rate.

591
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,088
Gear up, please.

592
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Gear up.

593
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,978
Nice view of the Hudson.

594
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,533
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

595
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,257
Life's easier in the air.

596
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,092
I guess it is.

597
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Birds!

598
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,012
Oh, shit.

599
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,575
Oh, yeah.

600
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,612
It's just turbulence, probably.

601
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,054
I'll check the cabin.

602
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,340
What do you think's going on?

603
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
It's okay.

604
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,690
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

605
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,938
We got one rolling back.

606
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,530
We have both of them rolling back.

607
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,129
Ignition start.

608
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,779
Oh, my God.

609
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,573
I'm starting the APU.

610
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,420
Just double-check your seat belts, please.

611
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,580
Seat belt. Relax.

612
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,196
Can I make sure
your seatbelts are fastened?

613
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,020
Make sure
your seat belts are fastened.

614
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,499
Seat belts.

615
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,173
- What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

616
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,896
- Then we're going back to LaGuardia.
- Yeah.

617
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,116
Get out the QRH.

618
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,176
Loss of thrust on both engines.

619
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,736
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

620
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
We hit birds.

621
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,931
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

622
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,490
We've lost thrust on both engines.
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

623
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,452
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

624
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,976
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

625
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,619
Which engine did you lose?

626
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,929
Both. Both engines.

627
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,236
- Supe?
- Yeah?

628
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,739
I have an emergency.

629
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
What's the report?

630
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,215
Both engines.

631
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,610
- What?
- Both engines gone. No thrust.

632
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,980
All right.

633
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,608
LaGuardia says go to runway 1-3.

634
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,408
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

635
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,218
1549, bird strike.

636
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,177
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

637
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,500
Which engine?

638
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,849
He lost thrust in both engines, he said.

639
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,895
Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1 -3?

640
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,730
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

641
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,855
I got an A320 diving for the river.

642
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,692
Al, stack all the inbounds to LaGuardia.

643
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,498
Let's put a hold on the tower, please.

644
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,854
Come on, guys, stay on point.

645
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,196
What about over to our right?

646
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,495
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

647
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,796
Teterboro tower, I need a runway.

648
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,596
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

649
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,973
Newark tower, what have you got?

650
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,916
You have runway 2-9 cleared and ready.

651
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,340
- You need emergency landing?
- Yes.

652
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Okay, yeah.

653
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,651
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

654
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,974
Shit.

655
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,498
This is the Captain.

656
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,218
Brace for impact.

657
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,495
Oh, my God.

658
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,809
What?

659
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,533
Brace, brace, brace!

660
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,368
Heads down, stay down!

661
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,970
Brace, brace, brace!

662
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,608
Heads down, stay down!

663
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,736
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

664
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,572
You can land runway one Teterboro.

665
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,855
We can't make it.

666
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,578
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

667
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,696
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

668
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,049
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

669
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,140
KC, come on over here.

670
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,217
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

671
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,458
Don't go in the river.

672
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,212
- Sir?
- Plug in.

673
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,299
Cactus 1549, if you can,

674
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,894
you got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

675
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,891
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

676
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,575
Come on.

677
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,739
Please, God.

678
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,974
I'm sorry, Patrick.

679
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,596
He's inbound to Newark, I know it.
He just went off the box to focus.

680
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Patty.

681
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,139
He'll come back up.

682
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,012
He's heading to Teterboro.

683
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,091
We need other eyes and ears.

684
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,174
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

685
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,100
When we come up
around this bend up here,

686
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,938
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

687
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,051
We got an A320 on emergency descent.

688
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,815
Cactus 1549 is low level above the Hudson.

689
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,615
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

690
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,299
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.

691
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,371
I'm staying on this.

692
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,053
He's out there.

693
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,853
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.
It's only seven miles.

694
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,133
Cactus 1549, this is departure control.
On guard, do you read?

695
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,572
He's going down.

696
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,371
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

697
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,419
Shit! He's going down!
He's gonna hit the water.

698
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,169
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

699
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,009
Tester's gonna come down.

700
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,337
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

701
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,816
His voice was so calm.

702
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,294
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

703
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,531
This isn't happening.

704
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,014
People don't survive
water landings, Henry.

705
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,899
Pull up. Pull up.

706
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,334
We're gonna brace.

707
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Pull up! Pull up!

708
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,375
Thirty.

709
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,214
Twenty.

710
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Ten.

711
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,819
I'd better go.

712
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,133
I am so sorry. I love you.

713
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,418
Yeah. I gotta go.

714
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,916
It had just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport,

715
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,010
bound for Charlotte, North Carolina,

716
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,011
and then a mid-air disaster

717
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,377
struck US Airways Flight 1549.

718
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,328
It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.

719
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,209
The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land.

720
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,211
His options severely limited,

721
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,338
the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River.

722
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,213
Choosing to land
on the Hudson, that was a big "if."

723
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,340
Have you had
any troubles at home lately?

724
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,014
Why'd you do it, Sully?
Land in the water?

725
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,596
Sully, you did everything
you could. It was more than enough.

726
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,169
Every computer simulation
demonstrated that a return was possible.

727
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,420
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

728
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,015
There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

729
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,860
Wasn't that the most
dangerous thing you could have done?

730
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,616
This is Tasty 1-1.
Abort test bombing run.

731
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,556
I have an emergency
flight control malfunction.

732
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,899
Two, join on me.

733
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,096
Roger that.
Two joining on you.

734
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,618
- Feels like hydraulics.
- Sir, do we need to punch out?

735
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,340
No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.

736
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,259
Get the checklist.

737
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,756
We have the checklist, sir.

738
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,500
Increasing thrust.
We need altitude.

739
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,814
Hold on, we 're gonna climb.

740
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,180
Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 1-1

741
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,796
with an emergency
flight control malfunction.

742
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,060
We need a straight-in approach.

743
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,196
Roger, Tasty 1-1.

744
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,575
Turn left 2-0-0 to runway 3.

745
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,980
Unable.
I repeat, I need a straight-in approach.

746
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Okay.

747
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,940
Proceed straight ahead to runway 2-1.

748
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,658
2-1, Tasty 1-1.

749
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,212
Two, I'm decreasing speed.

750
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,211
Clear the board for a damage check.

751
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,276
One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.

752
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,495
Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.

753
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,329
One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.

754
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,996
I have visual on the runway.

755
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,169
What's our heading?

756
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,649
Heading 0-2-0.
Five miles out, sir.

757
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,932
All right. Gear in three.

758
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,380
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.

759
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,291
Looks like you're coming in hot.

760
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,396
Nellis Tower,
I need speed to maintain control.

761
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,331
Avoiding a stall.

762
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,116
One, check your heading.
You're not gonna make the runway.

763
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,175
I got it.

764
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,373
I'm bringing her back.

765
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,335
That was a hell of a landing, sir.

766
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,616
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

767
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,676
I'm gonna start charging you
for this stuff, all right?

768
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,540
- Oh, get out of here.
- You hear me?

769
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,928
- Thanks, Pete.
- Thanks, Pete.

770
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
You got any nuts?

771
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,256
Let me know if you need anything.

773
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,695
But what still seems so hard to believe

774
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,454
is that everyone
aboard the plane survived,

775
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,652
including two shivering babies
who were found in a life raft...

776
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Hey...

777
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,978
Is that you?

778
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,449
- Are you the pilot? Sully?
- Yeah.

779
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,372
- That is you, right?
- Yeah.

780
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,617
Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.

781
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,971
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

782
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,455
- That was really something.
- Yeah, he's a hero.

783
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,656
A real pleasure to meet you.

784
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,380
You know, we invented a drink after you

785
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,236
as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

786
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,057
Yeah, you did. In fact, I'll take one.

787
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,332
The Sully!

788
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,212
It's a shot of Grey Goose

789
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,373
with a, uh, splash of water.

790
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,292
Splash of water.

791
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,895
Hey, listen.

792
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,252
To January 15th.

793
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,055
Best day of the year.

794
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,620
- To Sully.
- Sully.

795
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,820
Hey, Pete.

796
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,255
Sully's here, and he's there!

797
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,695
Damn, Pete. He's everywhere!

798
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,580
Yeah!

799
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,849
Sully!

800
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,175
You're like a real hero, man.
You know that?

801
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,330
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

802
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Agreed.

803
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,900
Twenty-one people on board, Cap.

804
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,658
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

805
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,856
- All right, thanks. Roger that.
- All right.

806
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,454
Twenty-one on the TJ,
departing Midtown, slip Seven.

807
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
Unbelievable.

808
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,236
I cannot believe
you have the sack to say that.

809
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,276
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

810
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
I'll say it again.

811
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,676
Dennis Eckersley is without question

812
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,860
the greatest relief pitcher
in the history of baseball.

813
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,373
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

814
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,576
Is that what it is? Or is it the mustache?

815
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,460
You're just jealous he was never a Yankee.

816
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,620
Jealous?

817
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,215
Yeah.

818
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,620
Now, let's turn to page seven...

819
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,491
Brace, brace, brace!

820
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,695
Heads down, stay down!

821
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,339
Let me hold him.

822
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,916
- Brace, brace, brace!
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

823
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,089
Okay.

824
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,137
Heads down, stay down!

825
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,291
Brace, brace, brace!

826
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,535
Heads down, stay down!

827
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,780
- We're not gonna make it, Uncle Robbie.
- It's okay.

828
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,076
Brace, brace, brace!

829
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,453
I love you, Mom.

830
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,975
- Heads down, stay down!
- To the moon and the stars

831
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,980
- and all the way back.
- And all the way back.

832
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,773
Heads down, stay down!

833
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,579
What do we do, darling?

834
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,409
Oh, my God.

835
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,934
Evacuate.

836
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,289
Evacuate.

837
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,899
Grab your life vests, please.

838
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,652
Opening forward door.

839
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,933
It's flooding back here!

840
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,579
Rob Kolodjay!

841
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,696
- Dad!
- Go, go, go!

842
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,578
Everyone! The aft exits are unusable.

843
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,095
Move forward to the overwing exits!

844
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,530
And don life vests now!

845
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,610
Go! Exit! Go, go!

846
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,260
Move forward.

847
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,596
Move forward to the right
or left exit door.

848
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,620
Jeff!

849
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,100
He's back there, can you see him?

850
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,699
Dad!

851
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,580
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump!

852
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,573
Sir, evacuate the plane right now! Go!

853
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,140
Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.

854
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,579
Sir! Come back, sir!

855
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,094
Calm down. You'll be fine.

856
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,579
The rafts are waiting.

857
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,739
Come on, come on, come on.

858
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,168
Hurry up!

859
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,076
It's gonna be bitter out there.
Here you go.

860
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,853
Here. Gonna be bitter out there.

861
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,060
Slowly.

862
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,676
You need to get off this plane now.

863
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,380
Feet first.
Slide slowly and gently.

864
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,180
- Plenty of room.
- Come on, people.

865
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,817
Okay. It's good now. Jump! Jump!

866
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,338
Oh, my God. Is that gas?

867
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,615
We have to jump.

868
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,288
No, no, no, wait!

869
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,129
You seeing this?

870
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,530
Yeah. Holy Christ, that's a plane.

871
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,009
Deploy that
man overboard ladder right away.

872
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,374
All right, I'm on it.

873
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,649
Shit.

874
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,728
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

875
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,494
Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1 -6, Thomas Jefferson.

876
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,732
We have a passenger airliner
in the north river.

877
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,209
We're en route. We will advise.

878
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,094
Let's go, let's go!

879
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,933
Jimmy, Jeff's still on that plane!

880
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,780
We can't leave him there!

881
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,532
Robbie, Robbie. Robbie!

882
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,895
Robbie! The crew will grab him, okay?

883
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,516
- The crew will get him, okay?
- He's in there!

884
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,100
He'll be okay. He'll be okay.

885
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,179
I'm okay, Mom. I'm okay.

886
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,859
- Ma!
- Just leave me.

887
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,851
Keep moving forward!

888
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,692
Follow your instructions.

889
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,836
- It's all right.
- There's water in the back.

890
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,396
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out!

891
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,780
One after another. Keep moving forward.
Keep moving forward.

892
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,379
This way. I'll help you out.

893
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,876
You go ahead, sweetheart.

894
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Come on. She can't move.

895
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,316
- Sir! Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am?

896
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,340
Right there.

897
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,889
Here's a floatation device.
Take that.

898
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,896
Everyone, keep moving forward.

899
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,857
Over the wings.

900
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,535
If you have a life vest, put it on!

901
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,170
All series near the Intrepid,
plane down.

902
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,457
We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution.

903
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,020
Stay calm and you'll all get out.

904
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,540
Thank you.

905
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,299
Move forward, move forward.

906
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,135
Come on!

907
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,049
Come on!

908
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,012
Put a blanket on her leg.

909
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,773
She needs a tourniquet.

910
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,896
You're gonna be fine, honey. Go slow.

911
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,659
Go slowly. Blanket.

912
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,889
Wrap this around her leg. Make it tight.

913
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,651
It's so cold out here.

914
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,451
Get those first-aid kits
up to the bow

915
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,372
and get some extra life jackets out there.

916
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,537
We're here! We're here!

917
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,377
It's all right. We're here.

918
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,254
Give me a countdown, Victor.

919
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,819
All right.

920
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,260
Three,

921
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,134
two...

922
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,132
We're good. We're good.

923
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,219
Come on, buddy.

924
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,615
Hold it right there, baby. Come on.

925
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,140
Easy. Go easy.

926
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,696
Come on. One at a time.

927
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,497
We're gonna get everybody, guys.

928
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,011
This is Yogi Berra.
We're 30 seconds out.

929
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,809
With a water temperature of 36 degrees
and a wind chill of minus 5,

930
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,858
the surviving passengers of Flight 1549

931
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,375
literally have minutes to live.

932
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,213
We're five out.
We have visual on aircraft.

933
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,556
All right, give me your hand.

934
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,935
If anybody's got any problems,
just wait down there.

935
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,660
We got some really good people
coming on their way, all right?

936
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,933
Stand by.

937
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,290
Fifty yards, go!

938
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,929
You okay?

939
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,011
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
All right?

940
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,180
Got you.

941
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,458
Is anyone still here? Come forward.

942
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,173
Captain! Come back!

943
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,819
Come forward!

944
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,451
We need to get off the plane now.

945
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,449
Captain!

946
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,214
Captain! We have to go!

947
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,371
It's time to get off the plane, right now!

948
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,251
All right, you guys go. Go.
I'll be right behind you.

949
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,777
Sully, we gotta go.

950
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
Thank you.

951
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,933
Everybody's okay.
Help is on the way.

952
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,414
Twenty-six passengers
going to Port Imperial.

953
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,616
Nineteen headed to Pier 81.

954
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,216
We got 24 passengers on board
headed to Port Imperial.

955
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,336
Whoever has miraculously survived

956
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,656
this plummet from the skies
into the icy Hudson

957
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,857
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

958
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,296
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

959
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,735
In Manhattan, Bobby Cuza, New York One.

960
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,180
Come on, sir. Give me your hand.

961
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,220
Grab on.

962
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,020
Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.

963
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,619
We got you.

964
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,012
- My hands.
- Gotta warm them up.

965
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,052
Get him a blanket, fast.

966
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,458
I was sure I was gonna die.

967
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,255
Hey, no one dies today.

968
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,814
Give me your hand.

969
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,729
Here you go, Captain. This way.

970
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,254
Give us your hand, sir.

971
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,739
Sully, wrap it around your arms.

972
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,739
- Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

973
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,356
Can we get
a couple more blankets over here?

974
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,380
Thank you.

975
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,855
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

976
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,375
Give him some room.

977
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,814
You're welcome.

978
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,455
Hello?

979
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,417
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

980
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,457
Oh, good. Are you still on the 5:50 home?

981
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,735
There's been an incident.

982
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,929
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

983
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,694
Turn on the television.

984
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,130
What do you mean "Turn on the television"?

985
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,779
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

986
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,130
I will call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

987
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,259
I had to land in the Hudson.

988
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,655
Sully, I don't understand.

989
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,655
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I am okay.

990
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,092
But I have to go.

991
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,812
Girls, turn on the TV.

992
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,740
An extensive rescue effort is underway

993
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,977
after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River,

994
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,694
- sending passengers scrambling for safety.
- Oh, my God.

995
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,796
If you have any wet clothing on,
take it off

996
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,015
and wrap up in a blanket
from the Red Cross.

997
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,531
You're gonna be okay. Okay, Lucille?

998
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,168
I'm gonna take you right
to the ambulance, all right?

999
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,375
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

1000
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,773
There's lots of boats! Jeff!

1001
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Sully!

1002
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,615
Dan!

1003
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,975
Dan, I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

1004
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,779
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

1005
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,419
Okay. How are you?

1006
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,134
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

1007
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,369
All right.

1008
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,332
Honey, it's me.

1009
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,610
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

1010
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,099
Sherri, I cannot believe
I am talking to you.

1011
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,293
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg

1012
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,018
and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

1013
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,196
If the Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

1014
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,220
We're still working.

1015
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,496
Sully, I can keep assembling the count.

1016
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
Jeff.

1017
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,291
Jeff, I need a count.
We've gotta have a count.

1018
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,316
There's no way to get
a real count out here, Sully.

1019
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,340
Sully, Jeff's right.

1020
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,476
Let's get you in some dry clothes
before you freeze to death.

1021
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,356
Captain, what if the Mayor and Chief Kelly
come down here to meet with you?

1022
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,257
Dan, because it was a domestic flight...

1023
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,773
Yeah, we got no manifest.

1024
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,659
We're gonna have to track
the passenger information down one by one.

1025
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,094
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1026
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,356
I'm gonna call John Carey.
We're gonna get you a count.

1027
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,940
But, Sully, listen. You've done enough.
Let me take it from here.

1028
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,650
- Jeff?
- Pop!

1029
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,935
I'm okay.

1030
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I was on the other wing.
They brought us to Jersey.

1031
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,492
I couldn't see you. I couldn't find you.

1032
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,580
I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.

1033
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,458
I shouted back. I guess the river...

1034
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Are you okay?

1035
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,414
I love you, son.

1036
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,017
I love you, too.

1037
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,652
Can you believe we made it?

1038
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,818
I mean, the plane crashed

1039
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,777
on the river!

1040
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,539
Are you kidding me?

1041
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,740
Ah, so unbelievable.

1042
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,617
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1043
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,100
Hey, Patty.

1044
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,694
Supe sent me looking for you.

1045
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,339
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1046
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,695
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1047
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,328
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1048
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,251
Huh. I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch!

1049
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,768
What?

1050
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,369
Everyone's been pulled off.
It's a miracle!

1051
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,417
I thought I lost them all.

1052
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,696
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1053
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,330
What is my pulse rate?

1054
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,532
It's 110.

1055
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,137
My normal resting is 55.

1056
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,528
110...

1057
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,659
That's not good.

1058
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,334
You are right. 110 is not good.

1059
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,816
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1060
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,777
How is Doreen?

1061
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,373
Fairly severe laceration.

1062
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,316
But we'll keep her a day or two
to stem the infection.

1063
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,455
But she'll be okay?

1064
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,975
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1065
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,316
Although no one'll believe her.

1066
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,756
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1067
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,596
You landed a plane on the Hudson.
Not a scratch on you.

1068
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,655
Arnie.

1069
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,858
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today, huh?

1070
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,659
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

1071
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,054
Got a count.

1072
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,334
155.

1073
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,248
155.

1074
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,614
It's official.

1075
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,851
- 155.
- 155.

1076
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,419
155.

1077
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,658
Thank you, Arnie.

1078
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,371
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1079
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,893
- Sully.
- Carl.

1080
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,900
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1081
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,015
Well, we're here.

1082
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,057
It's about all I know at the moment.

1083
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,132
Oh, this is Ms. May, with the hotel.

1084
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,820
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

1085
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,260
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1086
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,556
This is only to say that my staff and I

1087
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,956
are committed to protecting your privacy.

1088
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,494
So, if there's anything I can do at all...

1089
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,811
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1090
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,420
It's the only clothing that I have.

1091
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Dry-cleaning?

1092
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,332
If it's too much... If it's too late...

1093
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,649
Are you kidding?

1094
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,693
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

1095
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,489
Oh, okay.

1096
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,690
Well, thank you, Evelyn.
Thank you very much.

1097
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,691
- Anything for Sully.
- Okay.

1098
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,259
Have a blessed day.

1099
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,053
What just happened?

1100
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,450
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1101
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,373
Ah, come on, Sully.

1102
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,531
When's the last time you heard of someone

1103
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,691
landing a jet plane on the water

1104
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,539
and everybody lived?

1105
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,055
Exactly.

1106
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,215
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1107
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,377
And new clothes.

1108
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,936
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1109
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,772
Kmart was the only store open.

1110
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,236
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.

1111
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,728
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- Yeah.

1112
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,220
Sully.

1113
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,652
What are you even still doing in uniform?

1114
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,652
Ah. You know, I don't know.

1115
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,415
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1116
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,414
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1117
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,370
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

1118
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,574
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1119
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,740
Especially with an airplane in it.

1120
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,939
I'll see you later, Sully.

1121
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,690
The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing."

1122
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,977
The perfect timing of the NYPD scuba units

1123
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,171
and of the ferry boat captains,

1124
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,492
and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.

1125
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,050
Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time,

1126
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,450
became a man for all time.

1127
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,780
This is Kristine Johnson...

1128
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,940
The timing.

1129
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,780
...reporting live from the Hudson River.

1130
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,076
New York One Minute.

1131
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,236
The coast guard released this new video
of Flight 1549

1132
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,216
making its emergency landing
on the Hudson.

1133
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,292
Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft.

1134
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,652
Hey, Sully. Let me...

1135
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,219
Come on. Answer.

1136
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,015
Answer!

1137
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,535
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1138
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,815
Sully?

1139
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,655
I know that Airbus has simulations
scheduled for the S22 sim at the factory.

1140
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,415
But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?

1141
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,854
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1142
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,140
I need you to make it happen

1143
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,739
before we listen to the CVR.

1144
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,856
Before our testimony is complete.

1145
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,169
Why?

1146
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,738
I have a right to see the simulations
and I have a feeling that

1147
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,256
with human pilots and not a computer,
the results are going to be different.

1148
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,854
What if they show the exact same result?

1149
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,375
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

1150
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,893
It's all about the timing, Larry.

1151
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,156
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

1152
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,932
I sure as hell agree with that.

1153
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,409
The CVR is on Wednesday. That's 36 hours.

1154
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,899
Can you make it happen?

1155
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,699
I'll try.
It's a lot of phone calls to make.

1156
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,516
It's already 7:30
in the morning in France,

1157
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,655
so you better get started.

1158
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,697
Thank you, Larry. Thank you.

1159
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Hey, Lorrie.

1160
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,772
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing.

1161
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,374
Sweetheart, what happened?

1162
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:44,371
I realized just now,
for the first time, that there were...

1163
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,293
There were 155 people
on that plane and you were one of them.

1164
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,537
We almost lost you.

1165
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,172
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

1166
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,572
How are you holding up?

1167
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,293
Oh, I'm holding up.

1168
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,337
Please tell me this is almost over.

1169
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,418
It's almost over.

1170
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,615
Okay.

1171
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,895
I love you.

1172
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,459
I love you, too.

1173
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,810
I'll call you when they're done with me.

1174
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,416
- Sully.
- Let's go, Larry.

1175
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,455
- Good morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

1176
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,636
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

1177
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,809
My name is Charles Porter.

1178
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,659
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

1179
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,169
to conduct this public hearing here today.

1180
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,252
We have a lot of material to cover.

1181
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,493
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1182
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,580
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

1183
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,179
along with you, gentlemen.

1184
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,696
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

1185
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,090
Airbus has agreed to link us via satellite

1186
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,330
to today's piloted simulations.

1187
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,172
Upload link, please.

1188
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,700
They're just simulations, Sully.

1189
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,090
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1190
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,498
Might change theirs.

1191
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,135
Birds.

1192
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,740
Number one's rolling back. And number two.

1193
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,220
Auto pilot's off.

1194
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,576
- Pilot off.
- Flight Director's off.

1195
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,889
Flight Director is off.

1196
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,858
All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1197
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,379
We have to return to the field.

1198
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,213
Okay. I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1 -3.

1199
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,420
I'll activate the approach for you.

1200
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,453
It's activated.

1201
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,053
Runway 1-3.

1202
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,097
Glide slopes coming in nicely.

1203
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,816
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1204
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,812
Sink Rate 900.

1205
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,658
Too low, flaps.

1206
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,573
Flight slow.

1207
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,219
Too low, flaps.

1208
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,617
Forty, 30, 20...

1209
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,291
Successful landing
at LaGuardia, runway 1-3.

1210
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,740
For the record,

1211
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,972
the pilots and the computer
sims bear the same result.

1212
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,455
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1213
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,252
Upload the second run.

1214
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,934
Birds.

1215
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,276
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1216
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,858
Heading 3-1-0.

1217
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,420
I'm gonna give you direct to Teterboro.

1218
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,900
Direct Teterboro.

1219
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,500
One thousand.

1220
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,208
Flaps two.

1221
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,574
Flaps two.

1222
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,820
Too low, terrain.

1223
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,419
Too low, terrain.

1224
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,019
Too low, terrain.

1225
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,379
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1226
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,568
Successful landing
at Teterboro, runway 1-9.

1227
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,488
Multiple airports, runways,
two successful landings.

1228
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:52,092
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1229
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,250
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1230
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:02,220
And frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1231
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,696
Can we get serious now?

1232
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,535
Captain?

1233
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,436
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

1234
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,020
and now we are watching actual sims.

1235
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,330
But I can't quite believe

1236
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:19,452
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

1237
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,139
Human piloted simulations

1238
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,260
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1239
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,894
No, they don't.

1240
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,219
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings,

1241
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,888
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

1242
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,780
Well, they may not be reacting
like you did.

1243
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,452
Immediately after the bird strike

1244
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,178
they are turning back for the airport.

1245
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,296
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

1246
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,460
That is correct.

1247
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,896
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1248
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,419
They did not run a check.

1249
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:45,933
They did not switch on the APU.

1250
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,375
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

1251
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,178
No one warned us.

1252
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,133
No one said,
"You are going to lose both engines"

1253
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,939
"at a lower altitude
than any jet in history."

1254
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,729
"But be cool."

1255
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,255
"Just make a left turn for LaGuardia"

1256
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,695
"like you're going back
to pick up the milk."

1257
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,218
This was dual engine loss at 2,800 feet

1258
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,570
followed by an immediate water landing

1259
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:12,334
with 155 souls on board.

1260
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,288
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

1261
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,460
No one.

1262
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,776
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

1263
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,335
we were not the Thunderbirds up there.

1264
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,316
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver

1265
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,410
before he actually pulled it off.

1266
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,292
I'm not questioning the pilots.

1267
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,893
They're good pilots.

1268
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,972
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

1269
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,937
immediately after the bird strike.

1270
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,258
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1271
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,613
In these simulations, you've taken
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1272
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,653
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

1273
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,378
For these simulations?

1274
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,215
You are looking for human error.

1275
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,338
Then make it human.

1276
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,370
This wasn't a video game.

1277
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,292
It was life and death.

1278
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,010
Sully's right. That's worth a few seconds.

1279
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,614
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1280
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,019
Seventeen.

1281
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,898
Seventeen?

1282
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:34,658
The pilot who landed at Teterboro
had 17 practice attempts

1283
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,493
before the simulation we just witnessed.

1284
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,899
Your reaction decision time
will be set at 35 seconds.

1285
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,810
Thirty-five seconds.
That's not enough time.

1286
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,053
We only had 208 seconds total,

1287
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,339
so I'll take it.

1288
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,014
Upload the link.

1289
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,533
Return to LaGuardia.

1290
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,260
Now with an added
35-second delay in response time.

1291
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,516
- Birds.
- Okay, I saw them.

1292
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,900
- Give me 35 seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1293
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,089
Time's up.

1294
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,449
Here we go.

1295
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,088
Flight path vector.

1296
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,769
Going for 1 -3.

1297
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,975
Okay.

1298
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,660
Activate confirm.

1299
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,930
All right. You are confirmed.

1300
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,060
We're heading right for the airport.

1301
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,980
Caution, obstacle.

1302
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,219
Caution, obstacle.

1303
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,935
We're about
seven miles from the runway.

1304
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,618
Caution, obstacle.

1305
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,652
Terrain, terrain.

1306
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,139
Pull up.

1307
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,380
Pull up.

1308
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,700
Pull up.

1309
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,380
Pull up.

1310
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,771
Too low, terrain.

1311
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,876
We got a little extra speed.

1312
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,935
You want some flaps?

1313
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,093
Too low, terrain.

1314
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,740
No, leave the flaps up.

1315
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,858
Too low, terrain.

1316
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,414
Too low, terrain.

1317
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,134
Too low, terrain.

1318
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,293
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1319
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,532
Let's try Teterboro.

1320
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,848
Upload the link, please.

1321
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,815
Birds.

1322
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,796
Auto pilot off.
Flight Director off.

1323
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,820
Hack the time.

1324
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,381
- Thirty-five seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1325
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,132
Engine one and two fail.

1326
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Turn.

1327
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,860
Okay.

1328
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,811
Let's see if we can make it.

1329
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,500
Heading sub 2-9-8.

1330
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,013
You seeing Teterboro out there?

1331
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,374
I do.

1332
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,139
Way too low.

1333
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,817
Obstacle, obstacle.

1334
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,979
Pull up.

1335
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,055
Pull up.

1336
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,020
Pull up.

1337
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,180
Pull up.

1338
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,540
Pull up.

1339
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,056
Not gonna work, not gonna work.

1340
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,220
Pull up.

1341
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Pull up.

1342
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,851
Pull up.

1343
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,373
Does anyone need to see more simulations?

1344
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,939
Now that we've seen
what could have happened,

1345
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,529
can we, uh, listen to what actually did?

1346
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,938
We will look at all
the results at a later date.

1347
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,414
Elizabeth.

1348
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,094
For the record,

1349
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,775
this is the CVR of US Airways Flight 1549,

1350
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,215
January 15th, 2009.

1351
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,814
Gentlemen, headsets.

1352
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Birds!

1353
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,618
Shit.

1354
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,208
Oh, yeah.

1355
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,418
We got one rolling back.

1356
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,895
We have both of them rolling back.

1357
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:26,340
Ignition start.

1358
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:33,974
I'm starting the APU.

1359
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,252
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1360
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,968
Get out the QRH.

1361
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,619
Priority left.

1362
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,133
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1363
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,490
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

1364
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,616
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1365
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,458
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

1366
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,276
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

1367
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,972
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1368
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,574
- Which engine did you lose?
- Both. Both engines.

1369
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,316
"If fuel remaining, engine mode,
select your ignition."

1370
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,659
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1371
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,209
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1372
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,769
Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.

1373
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,769
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1374
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,220
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

1375
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,700
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

1376
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,135
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1377
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,298
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1378
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,018
Online.

1379
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,978
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1380
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,812
Distress message transmit. We did that.

1381
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,858
Cactus 1549,
it's gonna be left traffic, runway 3-1.

1382
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,340
Unable.

1383
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,973
Okay. What do you need to land?

1384
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,260
Wind shear.

1385
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,371
FAC 1 off, then on.

1386
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,850
Been 10 seconds, Captain. Come on.

1387
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,254
Talk to me.

1388
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,614
Cactus 1549,

1389
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,658
runway 4's available if you wanna make
left traffic to runway 4.

1390
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,340
I don't think we can make any runway.

1391
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,376
Uh, what about over to our right?

1392
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,076
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

1393
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,180
Okay, yeah.
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

1394
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,374
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1395
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,236
This is Teterboro tower. Go ahead.

1396
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,216
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.

1397
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,836
Needs to go to the airport right now.

1398
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,100
Check. Does he need assistance?

1399
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,410
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1400
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,649
Cactus 1549, you wanna

1401
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,540
try and go to Teterboro?

1402
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,540
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1403
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,773
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1404
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,260
Pull up.

1405
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,739
Clear of conflict.

1406
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,701
"No relight after 30 seconds,
engine master one and two, confirm off."

1407
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:56,780
Off.

1408
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,093
"Wait 30 seconds."

1409
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,739
Too low, terrain.

1410
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,449
Too low, terrain.

1411
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,380
Too low, terrain.

1412
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,129
Too low, terrain.

1413
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,779
This is the captain.

1414
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,773
Brace for impact.

1415
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,340
Five hundred.

1416
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,452
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

1417
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,178
You can land runway one Teterboro.

1418
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,614
We can't make it.

1419
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,596
Okay. Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?

1420
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,939
Go ahead. Try number one.

1421
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,579
Number one.

1422
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,253
No relight.

1423
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,620
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

1424
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,916
Too low, terrain.

1425
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,460
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

1426
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,860
Too low, terrain.

1427
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,175
All right, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1428
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,340
Flaps out.

1429
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,180
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

1430
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,019
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

1431
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,436
Got flaps out.

1432
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,132
Two hundred fifty feet in the air.

1433
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,061
170 knots. Got no power on either one.
Try the other one.

1434
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,140
Try the other one.

1435
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,978
1549? Still up?

1436
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,620
One hundred and fifty knots.

1437
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,335
- Got flaps two. You want more?
- No. Let's stay at two.

1438
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,996
You got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

1439
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,356
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

1440
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,177
You got any ideas?

1441
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,700
Actually not.

1442
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,293
Terrain, terrain.

1443
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,853
Pull up. Pull up.

1444
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,060
Pull up.

1445
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,660
Pull up.

1446
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,580
Pull up.

1447
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,540
Pull up.

1448
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,020
Pull up.

1449
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,408
We're gonna brace.

1450
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,740
Pull up.

1451
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,020
Thirty...

1452
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,220
Twenty...

1453
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,580
Pull up.

1454
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,777
I need to take a quick break.

1455
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,618
What did you think?

1456
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,459
Hearing the CVR just now?

1457
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,771
Let me tell you what I think.

1458
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,412
I'm just so damn proud.

1459
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,938
And you, you were right there,
through all that distraction.

1460
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,971
With so much at stake.

1461
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,968
We did this together. We were a team.

1462
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,174
Thanks, Sully.

1463
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,696
- We did our job.
- We did our job.

1464
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,771
Hey, you did good.

1465
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,340
All right, folks.

1466
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,996
I'd like to call this hearing
back to order.

1467
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,692
If we could settle, please.

1468
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,173
Take your seats.

1469
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,016
That is honestly the first time

1470
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,011
that I have listened to a crash recording

1471
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,692
while actually sitting

1472
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,498
with the captain and the first officer.

1473
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,773
It's extraordinary.

1474
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,814
That was no simulation.

1475
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,213
No, it wasn't.

1476
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,088
Gentlemen,

1477
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:28,369
I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

1478
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,695
We just received a comprehensive report.

1479
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,052
There was extensive damage

1480
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,688
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

1481
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,658
Five compressor blades were fractured

1482
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:45,893
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

1483
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,297
So, no thrust?

1484
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:49,529
As you testified,

1485
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,370
it was completely destroyed.

1486
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,735
The ACARS data was wrong.

1487
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,378
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1488
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,857
I can say with absolute confidence

1489
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:08,012
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew,

1490
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:11,374
with bird experts, aviation engineers,

1491
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,379
after running through every scenario,

1492
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,770
after interviewing each player,

1493
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,694
there is still an "X" in this result

1494
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,253
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1495
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:28,414
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

1496
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,852
I disagree.

1497
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,253
It wasn't just me. It was all of us.

1498
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:39,218
It was Jeff and Donna
and Sheila and Doreen

1499
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,609
and all of the passengers,
the rescue workers,

1500
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,055
air traffic control,

1501
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:48,609
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1502
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,571
We all did it.

1503
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,610
We survived.

1504
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:03,133
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1505
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,736
Anything you would have done differently

1506
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,578
if you had to do it again?

1507
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,814
Yes.

1508
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,058
I would have done it in July.

1509
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:51,412
7F. 11F.

1510
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:52,580
9D.

1511
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,780
1C.

1512
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,896
- 25B.
- 26B.

1513
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,256
- 10B.
- 9A.

1514
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:01,332
- 13C.
- 21A and B.

1515
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,572
155 is a number,

1516
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:07,650
but when you can put faces to it

1517
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:12,177
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces,

1518
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,253
the wives, the daughters, the sons,
the fathers, the mothers, the brothers,

1519
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,736
it gets to be a pretty big
number pretty quickly.

1520
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,857
This is your captain speaking.

1521
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:30,459
I think today was as much and as good
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1522
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:35,058
And because of the events
of January 15, 2009,

1523
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:40,692
I'm convinced that we will be joined
in our hearts and in our minds forever.

1524
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,410
I am the keeper of the mail.

1525
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,650
So I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1526
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:46,415
And I open the letters
that come to our house from your families.

1527
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,178
And I open the Christmas cards.

1528
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,853
So, thank you so much

1529
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,171
for the gratitude that you've
expressed to our families

1530
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,695
and the letters and the cards

1531
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:59,489
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1532
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,979
So, thank you.
