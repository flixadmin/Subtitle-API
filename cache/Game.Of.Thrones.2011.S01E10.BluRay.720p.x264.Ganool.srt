479
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,024
despised by most,

480
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,401
feared by all...

481
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,111
Am l? That is good to know.

482
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,573
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

483
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,741
But you carry on...

484
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,912
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

485
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,958
l admire you.

486
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,336
And l admire you, Lord Baelish.

487
00:38:56,461 --> 00:39:00,883
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

488
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,011
- and women.
- A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.

489
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,348
So...

490
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,475
here we stand...

491
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,061
in mutual admiration and respect.

492
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,230
Playing our roles.

493
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,690
Serving a new king.

494
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,109
Long may he reign.

495
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,361
- My king.
- My king.

496
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,782
My lords. Shall we begin?

497
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,702
[Yoren] You're Arry now, hear me?

498
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,746
Arry the orphan boy.

499
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:35,501
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

500
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,503
What's your name?

501
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,795
Arry.

502
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,508
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

503
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,803
l've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

504
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,182
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

505
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,560
and l didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

506
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:54,978
This lot -

507
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,941
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

508
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:03,111
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

509
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,783
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

510
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,537
You stay with this lot, boy.

511
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,163
And stay...

512
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,959
or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

513
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,298
Watch yourself, midget.

514
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,009
He's got a sword, this one.

515
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,679
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

516
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,765
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

517
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,475
He looks like a girl.

518
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,686
l bet he stole that sword.

519
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,146
Let's have a look.

520
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,693
l could use me a sword like that.

521
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,153
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

522
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:48,031
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

523
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,992
l've seen him kick a boy to death.

524
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,286
l knocked him down
and l kicked him in the balls

525
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,663
and l kept kicking him
until he was dead.

526
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,582
l kicked him all to pieces.

527
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,211
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

528
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,005
l'll give it to you.

529
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:05,757
l already killed one fat boy.

530
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,260
l bet you never killed anyone.

531
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,096
l bet you're a liar. But l'm not.

532
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,098
l'm good at killing fat boys.

533
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,850
l like killing fat boys.

534
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,727
[Gasps]

535
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,021
You like picking on the little ones, do you?

536
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,815
l've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

537
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,318
When l hit that steel, it sings.

538
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,196
Are you gonna sing when l hit you?

539
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,079
This is castle-forged steel.

540
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,290
Where'd you steal it?

541
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,084
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

542
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,629
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

543
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:47,090
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

544
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,634
murderers.

545
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:52,054
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

546
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,226
But my master got sick of me, so...
here l am.

547
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:00,437
[Yoren] Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

548
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,857
lt's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

549
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,401
And winter is coming!

550
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,226
Ham.

551
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:44,189
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

552
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,067
Bring me some beer at least.

553
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:51,113
You look exhausted.

554
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,240
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

555
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,787
Don't look so terrified.

556
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:01,540
lf we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

557
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:04,376
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

558
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,838
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

559
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,591
Honour made you leave,

560
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,384
honour brought you back.

561
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,429
My friends brought me back.

562
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,515
l didn't say it was your honour.

563
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:23,270
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

564
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,522
No? Good.

565
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,358
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

566
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:34,156
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

567
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,326
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

568
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,578
from dusk until dawn.

569
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:44,124
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

570
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,794
to what ends the gods only know.

571
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,215
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

572
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,550
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

573
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,721
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

574
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:05,479
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

575
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:07,814
No.

576
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,735
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

577
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,739
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

578
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,909
- No.
- Good.

579
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,662
Because l want you
and your wolf with us

580
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:24,706
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

581
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,417
Beyond the Wall?

582
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,546
l'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

583
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,590
l mean to find out what's happening.

584
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,635
The Night's Watch will ride in force

585
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:40,931
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

586
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,558
[Men shouting]

587
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,311
[Mormont] And we will find Benjen Stark,

588
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,980
alive or dead.

589
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,149
l will command them myself.

590
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,820
So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

591
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:56,780
[Man] Move out!

592
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,491
[Mormont] ..are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

593
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,203
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

594
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,947
ls this your command, Khaleesi?

595
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,499
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

596
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:54,713
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

597
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,882
They were not given to me to sell.

598
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,474
Khaleesi, my Queen...

599
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,061
l vow to serve you, obey you,

600

601
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,483
but let him go, Khaleesi.

602
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,777
l know what you intend. Do not.

603
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,570
l must.

604
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,823
[Sighs] You don't understand...

605
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,869
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

606
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,746
l won't watch you burn.

607
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,416
ls that what you fear?

608
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,896
You will be my khalasar.

l free you.

- l will.
