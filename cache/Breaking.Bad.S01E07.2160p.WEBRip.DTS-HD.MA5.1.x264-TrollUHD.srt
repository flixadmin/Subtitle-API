1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,971
In closing, I can tell you

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,476
we take this very seriously.
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:09,853
Stopping the sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:12,061
remains one of our highest priorities.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,193
The theft of lab equipment from your
school is also receiving our attention.

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,279
Rest assured, no stone will go unturned

7
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:22,638
in our search for the person
or persons responsible for this.

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:25,577
If you have any questions,
now would be the time. Sir.

9
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,955
You're talking like
you haven't caught anybody yet.

10
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,464
What about the janitor
dealing drugs at school?

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:35,212
There is no indication
that this individual was selling drugs.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,220
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana

13
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,717
in his car, not in the school.

14
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,677
And he's since been fired.

15
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:46,848
He had a record. I'd like to know
how he got a job here in the first place.

16
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:48,808
Why wasn't there a background check?

17
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:53,230
There was one. We're currently
reviewing our hiring policies.

18
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:56,988
You better be doing more. This guy
was arrested in front of my daughter.

19
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,208
This guy was stealing
lab equipment, right?

20
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,404
That's not our thinking at this time.

21
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,863
We're looking at others, but not
limited to the maintenance staff.

22
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,333
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know when this happened?

23
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:10,914
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

24
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:14,522
We haven't been able to establish
a date or time. There is no sign

25
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:15,976
of breaking or entering.

26
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,421
So whoever took it had a key.

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,925
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

28
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,221
Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss
details with you. What I can tell you

29
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,979
is we have good people
working hard on this case.

30
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:32,102
I'm sorry, officer,
but that just sounds like double talk.

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,860
We're trying to protect our children.
Level with us.

32
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,149
Really, we're giving you
all the information we have.

33
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:41,308
You know what I'd like to see
in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

34
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:45,282
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and
locker searches and strip-searches.

35
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,286
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada

36
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:52,244
they arrested one
of the groundskeepers with drugs,

37
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,030
and the next day they found out over
half the students were high on LSD.

38
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,837
LSD? When were you gonna tell us
about the LSD?

39
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:03,717
No, please.
No one said anything about LSD.

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,170
What about the equipment that's stolen?

41
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,726
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry-department locker.

42
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,234
And tonight we're lucky
to have someone here

43
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,439
to give us some specifics.

44
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,232
Walt?

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,027
Yeah.

46
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:26,323
Mr. White
is currently on medical leave.

47
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:28,781
But as he's chair
of the science department

48
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:32,037
he's made a very special effort
to be with us here.

49
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:36,082
And I'd like to take a moment
to thank him for that.

50
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:48,094
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

51
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,680
- Please.
- Yes.

52
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,474
Sorry.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,935
And thank you.

54
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,984
The inventory list
for the missing labware is as follows:

55
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:08,365
<i>One 5000 milliliter
round-bottom boiling flask.</i>

56
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:13,119
<i>One Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters.</i>

57
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:16,206
<i>Two full-face respirators.</i>

58
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:20,210
<i>Some CEP funnels, some head
with a thermometer holder.</i>

59
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,804
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,312
Where did that come from?
And why was it so damn good?

61
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,066
Because it was illegal.

62
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:24,149
The basement.
Unfinished, of course.

63
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:29,237
But just look at all this space.
You gotta think rec room, media room.

64
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:32,490
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

65
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,327
{\an8}Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighborhood.

66
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:40,957
{\an8}Big lawns and shade trees,
walking distance to the country club.

67
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,966
{\an8}What happened there?

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,263
Bit of a fixer,
but this house has great bones.

69
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:03,409
{\an8}Know what? We're zeroing in. I've got
another listing, new, around the corner.

70
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,773
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:07,400
{\an8}- Hi.
- Hi.

72
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:12,906
{\an8}- It's by appointment only.
- Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.

73
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:18,536
{\an8}He's in the recreational vehicle.

74
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,003
{\an8}Yo, it's appointment only.

75
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,934
{\an8}How are you feeling?

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,193
{\an8}About as good as you look.
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

77
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,363
{\an8}Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

78
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,741
Yeah, Skinny Pete
said you wanted Tuco's address.

79
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,577
{\an8}Acting like you're all out for blood.

80
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,373
{\an8}But you are alive.
Obviously you wised up.

81
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:06,251
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

82
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,420
- So, what, are you selling your house?
- I got two dudes

83
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,779
{\an8}that turned into raspberry slushy
and flushed down my toilet.

84
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,301
{\an8}I can't even take a proper dump in there.

85
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,972
{\an8}I mean, the whole damn house
has gotta be haunted by now.

86
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:22,433
{\an8}You didn't actually go see Tuco.

87
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,019
Here.

88
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:32,235
{\an8}That is 17,500.
Your half of the 35,000.

89
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:36,823
{\an8}Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours. You've earned it.

90
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,576
- You got this money from Tuco?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:42,620
So Tuco gave you this,
is what you're saying.

92
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:43,879
Well, we made a deal.

93
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,499
- You made a deal?
- That's right.

94
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,795
{\an8}How...? Why would you
make a deal with that scumbag?

95
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,304
- You see what he did to me?
- Because I think

96
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:57,135
{\an8}that we can do business together.
We came to an understanding.

97
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,596
No way, man.
Okay? No understanding.

98
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,806
Take a look at the money in your hand.

99
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,560
Now, just imagine making that every week.

100
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:10,398
That's right.
Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.

101
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:16,696
{\an8}Without even talking to me
you told this insane ass-clown

102
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:20,283
{\an8}dead-eyed killer that...

103
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,441
{\an8}That we would give him 2 pounds a week.

104
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:25,285
We'll just scale up our operation,
add a few more hours.

105
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,021
No, don't talk to me about hours.

106
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:30,418
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

107
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:34,380
{\an8}You think the meth fairy's
just gonna bring it to us?

108
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,008
{\an8}God, it takes me a week
to get this stuff.

109
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm driving all the way to Las Cruces

110
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:42,472
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs.

111
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,642
{\an8}- Smurfs?
- The dudes who go to the drugstores,

112
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,850
{\an8}and get a couple boxes at a time
and then sell them to me.

113
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,837
That's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

114
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:56,027
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

115
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,278
All right.

116
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,907
Of course, you would've known
that if you would've just asked me.

117
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:06,412
- Well, here we are again.
- Here we are.

118
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,372
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

119
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,833
You must be, what, six, seven months?

120
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:14,212
- How goes it?
- It's great.

121
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,132
Other than waddling
to the bathroom every five minutes.

122
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,468
The baby shower is next week.

123
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:22,720
And it'll be good to...

124
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:26,516
It'll be good to have a day
that's just about Skyler.

125
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,601
Very nice.

126
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,066
- Walt, I see you committed to hair loss.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,610
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

129
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:41,155
I... You know, pretty decent, actually.

130
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:44,617
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

131
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:49,330
And he's even more physical.

132
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,999
More physical?

133
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,335
Well, sexual.

134
00:08:56,504 --> 00:09:00,550
Frisky, actually. I mean,
that's gotta be a good sign, right?

135
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:03,886
- Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
- Right.

136
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,514
Couldn't that mean
that the chemo is working?

137
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:10,768
Well, realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the antiemetics tuned right.

138
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,896
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo,

139
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:17,316
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

140
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:20,111
Well, isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

141
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,406
I've been wondering
about alternative medicine.

142
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,951
I mean, Eastern healing.

143
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,330
- You know, holistic.
- Well, I can't speak to its efficacy,

144
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,489
but as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment

145
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,503
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook

146
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:41,466
a better comfort, is fine by me.

147
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:45,928
So you're saying it's all psychological.

148
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,347
It doesn't make any real difference.

149
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:52,143
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

150
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:56,481
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

151
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,377
What?

152
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:27,470
A junkyard?
Let me guess, you picked this place?

153
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:31,349
What's wrong with it? It's private.

154
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:35,978
This is like a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

155
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:38,815
This is, "Oh, I saw this in a movie.
Look at me."

156
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:42,819
Yes. So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

157
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,780
I don't know, how about Taco Cabeza?

158
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,866
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

159
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:53,496
Nice and public. Open 24 hours.

160
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:57,083
Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.

161
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,378
Hell, why not the mall?

162
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:03,881
You know, wait at the Gap.
Hey, it's time for the meet.

163
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,843
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis

164
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,345
head on over, grab an Orange Julius.

165
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:13,099
Skip the part where
psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know

166
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:17,061
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

167
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:29,031
Look, you don't have to be here for this.

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,075
Okay? I mean, seriously.

169
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,077
I'm okay.

170
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,291
No. I'm no pussy.

171
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,835
I'm good.

172
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,770
Mr. Clean and his boy.

173
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,900
Now, I'm sorry that I had to tune you up.

174
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:07,320
Respect, <i>ése,</i>
you gotta give it to get it.

175
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,451
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

176
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:16,412
What, they close the mall or something?

177
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,499
Heisenberg, come on, break it out.

178
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:28,591
- That's it? That's all you got?
- We had some production problems.

179
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,968
0.53.

180
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,387
I thought you was a player.

181
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,515
You told me 2 pounds,

182
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,144
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

183
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:55,534
Seventeen and a half.
Minus the half for wasting my time.

184
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,162
- Hey, come on.
- What, you gonna argue?

185
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,706
You got something to say?

186
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:06,671
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

187
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,048
I want all of it.

188
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,803
Seventy grand.

189
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:16,514
- What did you say?
- You like this product.

190
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,516
And you want more.

191
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,686
Consider it a capital investment.

192
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,941
Look, old, bald motherfucker.

193
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,322
Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig.

194
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,908
Vig?

195
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,161
Interest, weekly.

196
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,915
Okay.

197
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:49,839
That's $65,625 with interest.

198
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,218
- 1.875 pounds.
- No, 2 pounds.

199
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,847
Next Friday, and no production problems.

200
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:01,475
Can you handle 4 pounds?

201
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:09,025
Listen, old man, talk is talk.

202
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:14,280
But owing me money, that's bad.

203
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:39,638
What did you just do?

204
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:47,229
Four pounds. Four pounds.
Two pounds wasn't bad enough.

205
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:51,442
We're talking 2, 300 boxes
of sinus pills.

206
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,700
There ain't that many smurfs
in the world.

207
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,780
We're not gonna need pseudoephedrine.

208
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,824
We're gonna make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace.

209
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:03,329
We're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

210
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,248
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

211
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,209
So you do have a plan.

212
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,628
Yeah, Mr. White.

213
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:12,254
Yeah, science.

214
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,965
Okay.

215
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:21,472
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

216
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,142
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

217
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,603
One autotransformer

218
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:33,401
6 liters anhydrous methenamine.

219
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:37,780
- Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
- It's mm, millimeter.

220
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:41,117
One 70 millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by.

221
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,619
Forty grams thorium nitrate.

222
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,539
Yo, Mr. White,
I can't even pronounce half this shit.

223
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,374
No. Count me out. All right?

224
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:51,132
I'm leaving town.
I'm moving to Oregon or something.

225
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:53,943
- This is just...
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.

226
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:59,343
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

227
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:02,596
- What are you doing?
- The first day of the rest of your life.

228
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,330
But what kind of life will it be?

229
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:08,310
Will it be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no. I can't do this."

230
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,355
Of never once believing in yourself?

231
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,984
- I don't know.
- Listen.

232
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:18,195
These things?
We need them, all right?

233
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:21,073
And only you can get them for us.

234
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:31,041
<i>Okay, it's ready. Here you go.</i>

235
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,921
<i>Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.</i>

236
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,180
<i>Of course you already know that
because when you watch this</i>

237
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:42,511
<i>20 years from now, I will look
exactly the same as I do now.</i>

238
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,309
<i>I know, it is amazing.
I have aged shockingly well. Haven't I?</i>

239
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:53,856
<i>Anyway, welcome to your baby shower,
Esmeralda.</i>

240
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,859
<i>- Esmeralda?
- Esmeralda.</i>

241
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,267
<i>That's your name
and you heard it here first.</i>

242
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:03,866
<i>Now, that is your wonderful,
handsome older brother.</i>

243
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:06,911
<i>Show her, older brother, your face.</i>

244
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:12,374
<i>Okay, not right up the nose. Don't...
Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.</i>

245
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,254
<i>Here's your mommy. Hello, Mom.</i>

246
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:20,758
<i>- And look, there you are, Esmeralda.
- Yeah.</i>

247
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:27,473
<i>- Wake up, baby. Time to party.
- Easy, easy. Believe it or not</i>

248
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:32,770
<i>Esmeralda, right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.</i>

249
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,328
<i>And I believe, Hank,
that was around the time</i>

250
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,539
<i>we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum.</i>

251
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,000
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.</i>

252
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,198
<i>Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.</i>

253
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:52,289
<i>There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy.
Say hello to your daughter.</i>

254
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:00,506
<i>Holly, I am very proud of you.</i>

255
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:05,135
<i>And I...
I think about you all the time.</i>

256
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:14,270
<i>Wherever you go, whatever you do in life</i>

257
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:20,317
<i>always know that you have a family
who loves you very, very much.</i>

258
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,614
<i>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</i>

259
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:30,452
Oh, my God, it's so cute.
Oh, Carmen. It's...

260
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,956
Oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable.

261
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:37,501
- I love it, Carmen. Thank you.
- You're so welcome, honey.

262
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,963
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

263
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:48,512
- Okay.
- From me. And Hank.

264
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,972
What nice wrapping paper.

265
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,308
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

266
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,351
- I do.
- Okay.

267
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,480
Let's see. And...

268
00:18:58,689 --> 00:18:59,940
Exciting.

269
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,695
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

270
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:14,913
- It's... It's a... A tiara.
- Yes.

271
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,293
Marie, is this...?

272
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:23,297
White gold and several carats
worth of zircons.

273
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,924
Oh, Marie.
You spent too much on this.

274
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:29,345
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

275
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:33,515
But it's so... It's really... It's...

276
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,767
It's sparkly.

277
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:38,103
- Sparkly.
- I know.

278
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:41,190
- Thank you.
- Hey, listen, Walt.

279
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,198
You got anything stronger than beer?

280
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,195
- It's... It's great. I love it.
- Yeah.

281
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:50,741
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie, thank you.

282
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:56,413
Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after
200 presents, it just gets kind of old.

283
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,794
- It's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

284
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:08,342
I got just the thing to go with that.

285
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:16,850
- I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

286
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:18,894
You mind if I have one?

287
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:24,608
- You think that's a good idea?
- Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

288
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,862
Okay. You got me there.

289
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:32,116
Thanks.

290
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,829
Cuban.

291
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:43,961
I did a little favor for an FBI guy.

292
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:49,758
Now, I was under the impression

293
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,469
that these were illegal.

294
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:59,601
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit
tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

295
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:07,651
It's funny, isn't it?
How we draw that line.

296
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,445
Yeah.

297
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,864
What line is that?

298
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:19,621
Well, what's legal, what's illegal.
You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.

299
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,502
You know, if we were drinking this
in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.

300
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:29,006
Another year, we'd be okay.

301
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,926
Who knows what will be legal next year.

302
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,221
You mean like pot?

303
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:45,189
Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.

304
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,234
Cocaine? Heroin?

305
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,988
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

306
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:58,744
Well, you ought to visit lockup.
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.

307
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:02,623
"Hey, man, what, you busting me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

308
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:07,377
It's all going to be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

309
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,004
Say it, buddy.

310
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,215
It don't only go one way either.

311
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:14,760
I mean, some other stuff is legal
that shouldn't be.

312
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:19,223
I mean, frigging meth used to be legal.

313
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:23,769
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

314
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:27,313
Thank God they came to their senses
on that one, huh?

315
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,610
Yeah.

316
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:39,243
Okay.

317
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,750
Nice party.

318
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:52,172
A tiara.

319
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:57,010
A white-gold tiara for a newborn baby.

320
00:22:57,219 --> 00:23:02,391
Yeah. You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.

321
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,939
I mean, that thing must've cost,
like, what, 5 or 600 dollars.

322
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,944
You know, I think I'm gonna return it.

323
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,738
Are you sure?
She's bound to find out.

324
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:21,034
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie

325
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:26,123
more than a white-gold baby tiara.

326
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,258
Hey. You know, I've been thinking

327
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,719
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

328
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:36,466
No. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mention that anymore.

329
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,971
No, no, no. What I mean is that
maybe there is something to it.

330
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:48,770
Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

331
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:52,816
Healing ceremony. It's supposed
to be good for your lungs.

332
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,360
I'm not saying that I believe in it...

333
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:01,074
but it might be an experience.

334
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,951
Really.

335
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,870
You?

336
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,371
In a sweat lodge.

337
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:10,626
I was thinking about driving up
on Friday, coming back Sunday.

338
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:14,796
- I mean, if you're okay with it.
- Well, of course I'm okay with that.

339
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,590
Okay.

340
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:27,559
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

341
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,228
I'm already sweating. Help me out.

342
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,148
Okay.

343
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,275
Hey.

344
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,469
70 millimeter tube furnace. Excellent.

345
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,906
- This is excellent. Good work.
- Damn straight.

346
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,952
Okay, hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced, yes?

347
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,010
Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this...

348
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:50,749
This crap wasn't easy to get.
And it's expensive.

349
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,758
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

350
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,586
I don't see the methylamine.

351
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:58,674
Yeah, well,
that's where I ran into some trouble.

352
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,300
What kind of trouble?

353
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,709
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

354
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:06,014
But this methylamine...

355
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,601
Not so easy.
I mean, they got it locked down tight.

356
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,980
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

357
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:16,024
But they want 10 grand.

358
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,133
What's the problem?
You have the money.

359
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:20,779
No, had.
I spent almost the whole wad.

360
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:25,200
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

361
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,371
So these thieves, did they say
where they would be stealing it from?

362
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,290
A chemical supply place, south of town.

363
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:36,545
They got guards and security cameras.
They got steel doors.

364
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:40,090
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

365
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:41,925
What?

366
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,568
So why don't we just steal it ourselves?

367
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,446
Yeah?

368
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:04,865
How we gonna do that?

369
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,909
With this.

370
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,383
So, what's this stuff called again?

371
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,263
Thermite.

372
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,682
And that will cut through a lock?

373
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,518
Because this is supposed to be
one big-ass lock.

374
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,229
In World War II

375
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:40,400
the Germans had an artillery piece...
It's the biggest in the world.

376
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,527
...called the Gustav Gun.

377
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:45,280
And it weighed a thousand tons.

378
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:49,785
And the Gustav
was capable of firing a 7-ton shell,

379
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:54,498
and hitting a target,
accurately, 23 miles away.

380
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,795
I mean, you could drop bombs on it
every day for a month

381
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:02,464
without ever disabling it.

382
00:27:02,964 --> 00:27:04,341
But

383
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,510
drop a commando

384
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:10,889
one man, with just a bag of this...

385
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:16,061
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel,

386
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:18,522
and destroy that gun forever.

387
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:23,443
Jeez.

388
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,281
So yes

389
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:33,537
I think it will cut through
any lock we're likely to find.

390
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:38,416
- You'd like to return this.
- It's very nice, but yes.

391
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,836
Well, it... It is from this store,
isn't it?

392
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:43,713
Oh, yes, it's from this store.

393
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:46,049
Do you happen to have a receipt?

394
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:48,718
No, I don't. It was a gift.

395
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:50,636
A gift.

396
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:53,056
Mr. Wilson,
could you step over here, please?

397
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:59,104
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

398
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,189
Whoa, excuse me?

399
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:04,901
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

400
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,487
- It...
- Come with me, please.

401
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:13,869
Oh, yes. I intend to press charges.

402
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,705
Please do.

403
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,207
We'll be here.

404
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,713
Look, I...
I've never stolen anything in my life.

405
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:28,925
All right?
I told you, that tiara was a gift...

406
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:32,387
- A baby-shower gift.
- So who gave it to you, then?

407
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:38,184
- I don't have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

408
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:40,061
You can talk to the police.

409
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,570
I can tell them
my daughter-in-law remembers

410
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:45,734
showing this particular item
to a tall blond woman

411
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:49,292
who, when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

412
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,156
- So there.
- Oh, yeah?

413
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:55,327
Well, then, I can talk
to the Channel Three News.

414
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:59,456
Yeah, I can tell them
how you people, without a shred...

415
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:02,667
Without a modicum of evidence,
illegally detained

416
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:07,297
an innocent pregnant woman
in a dank storeroom.

417
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:11,259
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

418
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:15,138
Furthermore, I'm not
getting enough air back here.

419
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,891
I don't think...
I don't think I can breathe.

420
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:20,936
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, no.

421
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:24,272
I'm going into labor. Yes, I...

422
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,369
<i>Hi, you've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.</i>

423
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:40,956
Marie, it's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

424
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:45,043
I need to talk to you immediately.

425
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,506
Where is the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

426
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:52,964
- Do you think he already passed?
- Look, I don't... I don't know.

427
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,094
Okay.

428
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:56,762
- Wait, there he is. There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

429
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,473
Okay, wait till he passes.

430
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:00,225
Okay, it's clear.

431
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,522
Here.

432
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,777
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

433
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,947
If this is all they had,
you're in the wrong place.

434
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,448
Just put it on.

435
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:17,575
Should've... Of course.

436
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,251
Okay, okay.

437
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,754
Okay. This is it.

438
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:33,216
Oh, God.

439
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:47,063
Okay.

440
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,191
- Get...
- What?

441
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,360
- Look.
- What?

442
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,177
Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping...

443
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,615
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

444
00:30:58,074 --> 00:30:59,326
Oh, my God.

445
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:02,037
<i>Hope everything comes out all right.</i>

446
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,498
- He's going to the crapper.
- Oh, God.

447
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:08,710
- Okay. You coming, man? Come on.
- What are you doing?

448
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:43,161
Okay, there it is.

449
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,374
Is this gonna be loud?

450
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:50,168
You'll find out in about 10 seconds.

451
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:52,420
Stand back.

452
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:56,633
Jesus.

453
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:10,105
Come on, come on.

454
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:15,110
Hey, what's going on?

455
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:21,491
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't...

456
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:24,119
- God!
- What?

457
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:26,663
Let's just take this.
Come on, come on.

458
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:28,623
What the...?

459
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,000
Damn it.

460
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:38,591
What are you doing opening the door?

461
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:41,803
- How are we gonna take this thing out?
- Come on. Take that.

462
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:43,847
Lift.

463
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,724
- God.
- Jeez.

464
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,645
Hey. Somebody?

465
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:53,814
<i>- Billy, you back from the crapper yet?</i>
- Let me out of here.

466
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:57,902
- I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
<i>- The alarm's going off. Check it out.</i>

467
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,988
<i>Billy?</i>

468
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,449
<i>- Billy?</i>
- Jimmy?

469
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:03,950
Help!

470
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,966
- Come on, let me try.
- How is it gonna be any different?

471
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,843
- Can I just try it?
- Fine, go ahead.

472
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,346
Jesus. Okay.

473
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:27,557
All right.

474
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:37,400
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.

475
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:39,277
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm the king.

476
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,074
No. No, no. That didn't sound good.

477
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:49,579
Oh, God.

478
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,540
Well, this thing's not going anywhere.

479
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:56,461
We're not cooking
in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.

480
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,384
God.

481
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:06,137
What part of "slow it down"
did you not understand?

482
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:10,433
What are you talking...? I'm...
It's heavy, man. It got away from me.

483
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:13,686
Okay. All right.
Now, that's good, that's good.

484
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,980
Now just bring it up, bring it up.

485
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:19,275
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

486
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:22,946
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

487
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,531
Oh, shit.

488
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,075
Yeah. I don't know.

489
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:28,910
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

490
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:33,957
Good call, yo.

491
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:09,701
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

492
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:13,413
We'll need to run it two more hours

493
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:16,082
to have enough to make
4.5 pounds.

494
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,376
Four and a half, not 4?

495
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:21,629
Two pounds pays Tuco back.

496
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,301
Four and a half pounds
puts us $44,000 ahead.

497
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:29,470
- Each.
- Right on, man.

498
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:30,888
Right on.

499
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:33,847
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night

500
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:36,978
we can make
4.5 pounds a week for...

501
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:39,689
Well, for the foreseeable future.

502
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:43,484
How long is that gonna be?

503
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,780
I mean, in your situation.

504
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,450
How much cash do you need?

505
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,620
More.

506
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,127
Someone's in the yard.

507
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:05,340
Yeah, this is definitely the one.

508
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:06,883
It's pretty.

509
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,136
Actually, I like it.

510
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:12,445
We could pull that out
and put in a closet.

511
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:15,350
Just a little...
We'll have to bring that down.

512
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,311
I thought you didn't like
that type of thing.

513
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,189
Oh, no. No, I don't.

514
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,691
Right, right.

515
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:32,659
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon, an open house?

516
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:36,417
- I left her a message. It's not my fault.
- I don't care how you do it

517
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,937
just keep them out of here.
Do you understand?

518
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,833
- Yeah.
- All right, go.

519
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,524
Absolutely.

520
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:12,198
You know, you can't duck me forever.

521
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:13,616
What?

522
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:16,035
Come on, I left you, like, 15 messages.

523
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,744
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back.

524
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:21,791
I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.

525
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,049
Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

526
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,506
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

527
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,341
That...

528
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:34,137
That tiara.

529
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:38,349
They accused me, at Zachary's,
of shoplifting it.

530
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:41,018
What were you doing at Zachary's?

531
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,646
I was returning it.

532
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,733
You were returning it.

533
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:48,901
Why would you return it?

534
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,487
It just wasn't...

535
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:55,742
Marie, what is wrong with you?
Can you please tell me that?

536
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,078
Can you tell me
why you'd do such a thing?

537
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:05,501
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

538
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:12,800
That... means that I have no idea
what the hell you're even talking about.

539
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:16,012
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

540
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,805
The shop...

541
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:21,851
The shoplifting. No idea?

542
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:26,856
You're not going to admit this, are you?

543
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:31,319
I can't really admit to something

544
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:35,406
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

545
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:54,598
- Would you like that gift-wrapped?
- Yes, actually.

546
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:56,928
Don't forget to sign in.

547
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:04,268
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

548
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,231
You're right.

549
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:11,526
Look at this wall here.

550
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:25,373
Excuse me,
I'd just like to see the basement.

551
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:28,793
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

552
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:32,171
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

553
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,230
You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.

554
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,301
You got that? Is that sinking in?
Now, beat it.

555
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,637
All you all, house is not for sale.

556
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:41,931
Get the hell out.

557
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:23,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,227
So how was it?

559
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:32,565
Was it an experience?

560
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:34,191
Yeah.

561
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,320
It was definitely an experience.

562
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,869
What's that smell?

563
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,956
Oh, yeah, it's

564
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:51,834
sacred Navajo herbs.

565
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,794
You know.

566
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,560
Hey, everything okay?

567
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,228
No.

568
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,230
Not really.

569
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,901
Actually, not at all.

570
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:23,032
You know that tiara that Marie gave us?

571
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,955
- Yeah.
- Well, she stole it. Yep.

572
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:33,167
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

573
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:34,627
Oh, my God.

574
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:38,839
I mean, she refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

575
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,175
I don't know what to do.

576
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:51,519
People sometimes
do things for their families.

577
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:57,191
People sometimes
do things for their families?

578
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,403
And what, that justifies stealing?

579
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:03,489
Well...

580
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:07,326
That must've been some sweat lodge.

581
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:11,622
Are you even listening to the words
coming out of your mouth?

582
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,878
What would you do if it were me?

583
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:22,133
What do you mean, if it were you?

584
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:26,512
If it were me, what would you do?
Would you divorce me?

585
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:30,516
Would you turn me in to the police?

586
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:42,111
You don't want to find out.

587
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:55,541
You want something to eat?

588
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:01,255
No, thanks.

589
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,441
What is this shit? This is blue.

590
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,863
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

591
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:29,033
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

592
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:39,710
Tight, tight, tight, yeah.

593
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:43,798
Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

594
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,143
4.6.

595
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,687
Come on.

596
00:43:59,814 --> 00:44:02,983
And what'd I say, man?
This guy can cook.

597
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:05,192
You're all right, man. You're all right.

598
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:07,947
We're gonna make a lot of money together.

599
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:11,867
Just remember who you're working for.

600
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:16,247
What did you say?

601
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:19,505
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

602
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,169
Like they don't already know that?

603
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,048
Are you saying that they're stupid?

604
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:29,468
No, I'm just... I'm just saying.

605
00:44:29,677 --> 00:44:32,263
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid.

606
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:35,121
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

607
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:38,185
No, come on, Tuco. I'm just...
I'm just saying.

608
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:40,187
No, you're just speaking for me!

609
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:44,650
Like I ain't got the goddamn sense
to speak for myself!

610
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:48,279
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

611
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,197
Tuco.

612
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:51,782
Tuco.

613
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,204
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

614
00:45:04,211 --> 00:45:07,464
Heisenberg says "relax."

615
00:45:13,304 --> 00:45:16,098
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

616
00:45:16,307 --> 00:45:17,558
I'm relax...

617
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:36,410
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

618
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:41,706
That is messed up.

619
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,628
Okay, Heisenberg.

620
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:47,630
Next week.
