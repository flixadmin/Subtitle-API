1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,750
There.

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,710
That's them.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,030
Your play, Walter. You're on your own.

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,840
light here, Mike.

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,550
Where's the juice?

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,510
The methylamine isn't coming.

8
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,590
Why is that?

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,550
- And who the hell are you?

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,550
- I'm the man who's keeping it.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,430
What the hell's this?

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,150
We had an agreement, right?

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,150
We got our deal.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,670
So where's the tank, Mike?

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,590
Mike doesn't know where it is.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,590
Only I do.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,590
And you're dealing with me now,

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,590
not him.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,990
Why don't you just cut

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,990
to what it is you want...

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,590
...or what you think

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,590
is gonna happen here, all right?

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,590
Because we're gonna get

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,590
what we came for.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,790
That 1000 gallons of methylamine

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,790
is worth more in my hands...

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,830
...than it is in yours or anyone else's,

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,830
for that matter.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,550
But I need distribution.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,240
Distribution.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,150
That's right.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,990
So if you agree

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,990
to give up your cook...

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,620
...and sell my product instead...

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,990
...I'll give you 35 percent of the take.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,910
Thirty-five percent?

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,030
Wow, are you kidding me?

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,030
Thirty-five--

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,110
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,590
Know how far we had to stick our

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,590
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,390
Why the hell would we want you? You

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,390
know we have our own operation, right?

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,830
I know all about your operation.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,310
See, my partners here tell me

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,310
that you produce a meth...

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,750
...that's 70 percent pure,

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,750
if you're lucky.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,190
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,680
So?

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,870
So it's grade school T-ball...

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,430
...versus the New York Yankees.

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,870
Yours is just some tepid...

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,430
...off-brand, generic cola.

55
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,230
What I'm making is Classic Coke.

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,870
All right. Okay.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,710
So if we just waste you

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,710
right here right now...

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,430
...and leave you in the desert...

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,390
...then there is no more Coke

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,390
on the market, right?

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,020
See how that works? There's only us.

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,950
Do you really wanna live

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,950
in a world without Coca-Cola?

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,350
My partner tells me that your crew...

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,550
...switched to a P2P cook

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,550
because of our success.

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,190
You dye your meth with food colouring

69
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,190
to make it look like mine.

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,510
You already ape my product

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,510
at every turn.

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,550
But now...

73
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
...you have the opportunity

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
to sell it yourself.

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,880
I need you to listen to me.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,950
We're not gonna give up this deal...

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,070
...to be your errand boys,

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,070
do you understand?

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,470
For what?

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,750
To watch a bunch of junkies

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,750
get a better high?

82
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,470
A better high

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,470
means customers pay more.

84
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,550
A higher purity means a greater yield.

85
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,110
That's 130 million dollars of profit...

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,270
...that isn't being pissed away

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,270
by some substandard cook.

88
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,550
Now you listen to me.

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,830
You've got the greatest meth cook in A--

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,830
No, the two...

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,870
...greatest meth cooks in America

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,870
right here, and with our skills...

93
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,990
...you'll earn more

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,990
from that 35 percent...

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,790
...than you ever would on your own.

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,110
Yeah. So you say.

97
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,310
Just wondering why we're so lucky.

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,550
Why cut us in?

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,150
Mike is retiring from our crew...

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,880
...so his share of the partnership

101
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,880
is available...

102
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,200
...if you can handle his end,

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,200
distribution...

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,630
...and if you give him 5 million dollars

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,630
of the 15 million that you brought today.

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,820
Just think of it as a finder's fee

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,820
for bringing us together.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,230
We have 40 pounds of product

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,230
ready to ship, ready to go.

110
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,110
Are you ready?

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,990
Who the hell are you?

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,260
You know.

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,990
You all know exactly who I am.

114
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,150
Say my name.

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,390
Do what? I don't have a damn clue

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,390
who the hell you are.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,870
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,550
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,550
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,510
Are you sure?

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
That's right.

122
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,240
Now, say my name.

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,310
You're Heisenberg.

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,470
You're goddamn right.

125
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,590
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,230
Hey.

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,070
I appreciate the kind words...

128
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,310
...but I'm out too, remember?

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,230
I know. We'll talk.

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,790
Maybe we should talk about how and

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,790
when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.

132
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,870
And we will do that.

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,550
Absolutely.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,350
It's just, you know--

135
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,550
Look, Jesse, just give me

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,550
some time here, okay?

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,910
I'll need help getting things

138
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,910
up and running during this transition.

139
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,350
You can at least do that for me, right?

140
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,310
Come on. Don't worry.

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,310
We'll figure it out.

142
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,750
Well, I guess that's it.

143
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,830
Parting thoughts,

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,830
of which I have two:

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,830
First, as I said...

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,150
...I'll handle the legacy costs

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,150
out of my end...

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,470
...so you won't have to worry about

149
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,470
my guys anymore. Second, the bug.

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,910
The DEA will do a sweep.

151
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,910
Can't say when, could be anytime.

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,950
But you need to get it out of there,

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,950
sooner rather than later.

154
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
All right.

155
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
That's it?

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,710
No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,710
"sorry for chaining you to a radiator"?

158
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,390
Just get the bug, Walter.

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,030
So, hey.

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,270
I guess....

161
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,390
I guess I'll see you around.

162
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,990
No. Don't think so.

163
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,190
When I'm out, I'm out.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,190
Well, I'm out too, Mike.

165
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,390
Kid, just look out for yourself.

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,230
- Are we good?

167
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,230
- You tell me.

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,750
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.

169
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,390
You're good. Keep it coming.

170
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,390
Straight back.

171
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,270
Slow it down.

172
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,310
All right. That's good.

173
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,590
Hey, Mrs. White.

174
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,070
"Vamonos."

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,830
I wish.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,750
All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.

177
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,140
Walt.

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,070
What is this?

179
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,430
Do you really wanna know?

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,230
- Why are you hiding it here?

181
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,230
- Don't worry about it.

182
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,990
Who are you hiding it from?

183
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,830
I said don't worry about it.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,110
From the police?

185
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,390
Or someone else?

186
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,190
Someone who would kill for it?

187
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,510
Why don't you go back in the office?

188
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,390
Why don't you go back in the office

189
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,390
and let us do this?

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,630
We'll get it out of your hair.

191
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,190
What'd you bring me this time?

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,990
They're bacon banana cookies.

193
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,190
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!

194
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,110
Just bits. Just little bits of bacon.

195
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,960
Just enough to make

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,960
those suckers really pop.

197
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,990
Dan, this is too much.

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,310
I'm not sharing those.

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,390
Bad office etiquette?

200
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,390
I don't give a crap.

201
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,070
- They're mine.

202
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,070
- They're yours to do with as you please.

203
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,990
Good, because my husband's

204
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,990
not getting any either.

205
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,270
- How is Mickey?

206
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,270
- Don't get me started.

207
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,950
He wants to buy a boat.

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,870
I can't even get him

209
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,870
to start the lawnmower...

210
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,030
...and he wants to buy a boat.

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,150
I don't know. A boat might be nice.

212
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,150
A little one, maybe.

213
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,190
Oh, please.

214
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,190
Where would you even take a boat?

215
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,820
All the way down to Elephant Butte?

216
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,150
Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there.

217
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,270
You can even leave it at the lake

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,270
if you don't want to haul it.

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,400
We're not buying a boat,

220
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,400
I'll tell you that right now.

221
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,790
- And the last one is 545.

222
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,790
- 569.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,510
- Dang it. I almost got them all that time.

224
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,510
- Very good.

225
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,640
But actually, I've got an extra one

226
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,640
for you this week. 603.

227
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,430
- 603. Where is that?

228
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,430
- Right down there.

229
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,910
All right. I'll let you get to it.

230
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,710
Thanks, Dot.

231
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,750
Young Kaylee's gonna need

232
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,750
a second safety deposit box...

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,710
...if you decide to leave

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,710
one more dollar to her.

235
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,150
How's the rest of it?

236
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

237
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
The families are pretty reliable

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
with the pickups.

239
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,590
Nobody complaining

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,590
about wanting it all at once?

241
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,590
No, they get it.

242
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,590
Slow and steady wins the race.

243
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,350
So I guess this is it for a while?

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,670
Don't worry about the families.

245
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,230
They'll keep getting their deliveries.

246
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,720
I know times are tight,

247
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,720
but it's for the kids...

248
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,600
...and your sponsorship

249
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,600
would sure be appreciated.

250
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, we have a silver level,

251
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,640
but the gold and platinum levels...

252
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,630
...really get your name out there

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,630
on the banners and T-shirts.

254
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,240
Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call

255
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,240
me directly if things change, you hear?

256
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,590
Gomey, take a brick to my head if I

257
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,590
ever have to make another Fun Run call.

258
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,750
I'm done.

259
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,190
What's up? Why you smiling?

260
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,390
Because the Ehrmantraut warrant

261
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,390
just came in.

262
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,510
Now we're talking. How quick

263
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,510
can you get your group together?

264
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,150
- Two, three hours.

265
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,150
- Make it two.

266
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,510
We're gonna nail that son of a bi--

267
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,440
Police! Search warrant!

268
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,030
Police! Search warrant!

269
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,230
Coming. Hold your horses.

270
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,630
Search warrant.

271
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,390
Police! Search warrant!

272
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,630
- Police. Search warrant.

273
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,630
- Police. Search warrant.

274
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,310
How's that restraining order

275
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,310
working out for you?

276
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,310
If you want me to read that,

277
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm gonna need my glasses.

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,110
Too bad you had to make the trip out

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,110
from headquarters, sergeant.

280
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,030
From out of bed, you mean. When a cop

281
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,030
kills himself, they want a full report.

282
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,270
Just to say hello to who's in charge

283
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,270
of the Record Bureau.

284
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,480
A single contact wound.

285
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,790
Powder burn on his temple

286
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,790
and right hand.

287
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,550
Suicide, I'll bet you.

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,750
- Tell the wagon boys they can have him.

289
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,750
- Yes.

290
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,800
When I found him, he was....

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,800
He was dead.

292
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,470
Hey! Perfect timing.

293
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,870
Just about to get started.

294
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,920
You know, if you can get going

295
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,920
on that settling tank...

296
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,110
...that would be a huge help.

297
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,990
We left that stuff in there too long

298
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,990
after the last cook.

299
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,390
- Mr. White--

300
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,390
- I mean way too long.

301
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,830
Now we have a tremendous amount

302
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,830
of residue.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,870
You know what we need to invest in

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,870
is a power washer.

305
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,550
Mr. White, can we just take a second

306
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,550
and talk about all this?

307
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,830
Yeah, yeah, sure.

308
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,390
Yeah.

309
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,310
Look, you know what I think

310
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,310
we need to talk about?

311
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,630
Is doubling down.

312
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,550
Doubling down?

313
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,030
Cooking 100 pounds a week,

314
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,030
not 50.

315
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,160
As in starting a new lab,

316
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,160
a lab that you'll run.

317
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,470
A cook all of your own.

318
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,510
Why not? You deserve it.

319
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,320
You're every bit as good as me.

320
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,510
Well, what do you think?

321
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,790
Mr. White, I think that

322
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,790
nothing has changed for me.

323
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,070
I just wanna get my money

324
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,070
and get out.

325
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,480
Jesse, this....

326
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,310
What we do...

327
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,920
...being the best at something...

328
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,560
...is a very rare thing.

329
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,630
You don't just toss

330
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,630
something like that away.

331
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,910
And what, you wanna squander

332
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,910
that potential?

333
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,950
Your potential? Why?

334
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,750
To do what?

335
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,600
- I don't know.

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,600
- Well, think.

337
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,790
To do what, Jesse?

338
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,990
I'll-- I'll figure it out, all right?

339
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,190
Look at you.

340
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,580
What have you got in your life, huh?

341
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,580
Nothing. Nobody.

342
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,550
Oh, wait. Yes.

343
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,070
- Video games and go-carts.

344
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,070
- Mr. W--

345
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,150
And when you get tired of that,

346
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,150
what then?

347
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,270
And how soon will you

348
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,270
start using again?

349
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,150
Look....

350
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,230
Look, I know how upset you are

351
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,230
about what happened to this boy.

352
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,900
I am just as upset as you are.

353
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,310
Are you? Really?

354
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,470
How can you say that to me? Jesus!

355
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,030
I mean, I'm the one

356
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,030
who's the father here.

357
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,510
What, do I have to curl up in a ball

358
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,510
in tears in front of you?

359
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,350
Do I have to lock myself away in a room

360
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,350
and get high to prove it to you?

361
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,310
What happened to that boy

362
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,310
is a tragedy...

363
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,670
...and it tears me up inside!

364
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,510
But because it happened, what,

365
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,510
am I supposed to just lie down...

366
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,310
...and die with him? It's done!

367
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,150
It makes me sick that it happened...

368
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,150
...just like everyone else

369
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,150
who has died in our wake.

370
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,550
What Todd did...

371
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,430
...you and I have done things

372
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,430
that are just as bad.

373
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,950
Yeah.

374
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,400
All the people that we've killed,

375
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,400
Gale and the rest.

376
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,030
If you believe that there's a hell,

377
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,030
I don't know if you're into that...

378
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,910
...but we're already pretty much

379
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,910
going there, right?

380
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,430
But I'm not gonna lie down

381
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,430
until I get there.

382
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,950
What, just because I don't wanna

383
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,950
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

384
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,350
How many more people

385
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,350
are gonna die because of us?

386
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,790
No one. None.

387
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,550
Now that we're in control,

388
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,550
no one else gets hurt.

389
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,230
You keep saying that,

390
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,230
and it's bullshit every time!

391
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,550
- No.

392
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,550
- Always! You know what?

393
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,030
I'm done, okay?

394
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,070
You just give me my money,

395
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,070
and you and I, we're done.

396
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,710
Okay.

397
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,950
Why?

398
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,910
Why do you want this money?

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,440
Because it's mine. It's my cut.

400
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,990
But isn't it filthy blood money?

401
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,430
I mean, you're so pure.

402
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,430
You have such emotional depth.

403
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch

404
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
that dirty money.

405
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,870
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

406
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,760
Come on.

407
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,390
You want it.

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,020
You want it just as much as I want it.

409
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,390
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?

410
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,230
So stay and work with me...

411
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,630
...and you can make ten ti--

412
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,630
Twenty times as much.

413
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,990
Whatever, man.

414
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,350
You don't wanna pay me,

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,350
I don't care.

416
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,400
- Yes, you do.

417
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,400
- It's on you, all right?

418
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,070
- I'm done.

419
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,070
- No, you're not.

420
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,440
You're not done. You're not leaving.

421
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,440
Because if you leave, you get nothing!

422
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,750
Do you understand me? Nothing!

423
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,430
Jesse!

424
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,910
Budget for the current fiscal year

425
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,910
for electronic surveillance...

426
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,470
...is 1.5 million, on par with

427
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,470
ATF and the Marshal Service...

428
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,950
...but still just a fraction of FBI totals.

429
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,510
We're lobbying Congress

430
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,510
for an additional 1.41...

431
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,350
...but we're waiting on action reports

432
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,350
to demonstrate...

433
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,630
...we're actually getting worthwhile

434
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,630
results. Our undercover operations...

435
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,300
...reap the most successful

436
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,300
actionable intelligence...

437
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,200
...if you refer to the chart

438
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,200
in Appendix 4.

439
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,270
If ASAC Schrader can tell us about

440
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,270
the surveillance man-hours....

441
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,830
Hank?

442
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,990
Hank?

443
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,750
Hank!

444
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
I think we're going to wrap this up.

445
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,470
If ASAC Schrader can stay behind

446
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,470
while everyone else clears out.

447
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,790
Thank you, everybody.

448
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,190
You know no one wants...

449
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,710
...to see you succeed at this

450
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,710
more than me, right?

451
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,030
- Yes, sir.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,030
- I know how good you are.

453
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,070
I wouldn't have stuck my neck out

454
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,070
to get you here if I didn't.

455
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,630
But you're not knocking down

456
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,630
doors anymore, bubba.

457
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,110
You're in charge of a district office,

458
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,110
and that comes with responsibilities.

459
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,590
I mean, Hank, basic reports

460
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,590
aren't being filed in a timely manner.

461
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,430
I'll work on it. It'll get better.

462
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,060
Yeah, it will, because way too much

463
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,060
time and money...

464
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,590
...is being spent on the Fring case,

465
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,590
a case which is essentially over.

466
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,150
All this overtime to surveil

467
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,150
Michael Ehrmantraut?

468
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,780
That's just money that could

469
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,780
be better spent elsewhere.

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,070
I understand, but I'm not making

471
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,070
these choices lightly.

472
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,880
We've got increased reports

473
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,880
of blue meth on the street...

474
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,920
...Fring's gang is still operational, and

475
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,920
Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.

476
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,430
I believe you. But so what?

477
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,350
It's one case out of dozens,

478
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,350
and you don't play favourites...

479
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,430
- ...with it because it used to be yours.

480
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,430
- I really think--

481
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,230
Don't play favourites.

482
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,230
You got a biggerjob than that.

483
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,510
I mean, forget the financial cost.

484
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,910
I hear you're personally serving

485
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,910
search warrants out in the field?

486
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,390
That was an error in judgement.

487
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,390
Won't happen again.

488
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,710
You're damn right it won't.

489
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,710
I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.

490
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,430
The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut

491
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,430
is now zero. We clear?

492
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
Sure. Thank you.

493
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,750
- Clear.

494
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,750
- Good.

495
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,670
We'll be in touch.

496
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,910
Yeah?

497
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
- Hey.

498
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
- Hey.

499
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
So Ramey wanted

500
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
to catch up with you?

501
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,870
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

502
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,520
Yeah, something like that.

503
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,240
No more following Ehrmantraut.

504
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,590
Not worth the financial investment.

505
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,830
Well, it's not like

506
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,830
the guy's going anywhere.

507
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,430
He's not even bothering

508
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,430
to throw our tails anymore.

509
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,310
He's just living a boring old-man life

510
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,310
like he has nothing left to hide.

511
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,030
- And none of Fring's crew is talking?

512
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,030
- Not giving an inch.

513
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,870
You sweeten the pot enough?

514
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,350
Zero jail time and an all-expense-paid

515
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,350
trip to Maui?

516
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,790
Not that, but close.

517
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,790
Nobody wants to bite.

518
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,310
Christ!

519
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,270
They're either the most loyal crew in

520
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,270
history or someone's paying them off.

521
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,630
- You still checking bank records?

522
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,630
- No one living beyond their means.

523
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,310
Nine perps, all being represented

524
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,310
by one lawyer.

525
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,310
Not unusual in a case like this.

526
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,670
Yeah, this guy, what's his name?

527
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,670
Daniel Wachsberger?

528
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,950
He represents every one of these

529
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,950
douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.

530
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,950
Can we find out more

531
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,950
about the lawyer?

532
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,310
You want me to start

533
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,310
tailing a lawyer?

534
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,120
Like the shit ain't deep enough

535
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,120
for you already.

536
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,270
Ramey said we couldn't

537
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,270
follow Ehrmantraut.

538
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,510
He didn't say anything

539
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,510
about anybody else.

540
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,110
Do it.

541
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,670
You're the boss.

542
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,110
All right. Shall we get started?

543
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,390
Now, I know that most of this,

544
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,390
or all of this, is gonna be new to you.

545
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,440
But did you take chemistry

546
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,440
in high school?

547
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
Just basic?

548
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,700
No.

549
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,910
Okay. That's all right.

550
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,190
As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible

551
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,190
without being overwhelming.

552
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,910
Yes, sir.

553
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,070
Look, Todd, I don't need you

554
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,070
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

555
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,230
What I do need is your full effort

556
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,230
and attention.

557
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,630
Listen and apply yourself.

558
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,470
If you do that, then we just might have

559
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,470
a fighting chance here, okay?

560
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,350
- Okay.

561
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,350
- Okay.

562
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,270
Well, here we go.

563
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,630
Slowly. Steady.

564
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,070
The aluminium helps speed up

565
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,070
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

566
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,350
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.

567
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,590
You're gonna like the little Schticky,

568
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,590
but you're gonna love the big Schticky.

569
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,220
For bigger messes like dust bunnies....

570
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,870
Now...

571
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,990
...the CO2 freezes the liquid...

572
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,230
...crystallising it...

573
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,710
...which gives us our finished

574
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,710
methamphetamine.

575
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,190
Now all that's left...

576
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,070
...is to break it up, weigh it,

577
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,070
and we're done.

578
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,390
Wow, this is....

579
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,710
This is complicated. It's gonna take me

580
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,710
a few more times to get a grasp on it.

581
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,590
Oh, yeah. It'll take a few more times.

582
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,070
I do all right?

583
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,910
You did fine, Todd.

584
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,070
You applied yourself.

585
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,070
That's as much as I can ask.

586
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,310
Now all that's left,

587
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,310
I guess, is to talk money.

588
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,590
We can talk money

589
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,590
once I get this right.

590
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,310
Morning. Guess what I have.

591
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,190
Cake pops.

592
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,190
They're balls of cake on a stick.

593
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.

594
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,030
See? I put little faces on them.

595
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Hey.

596
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,040
Hey.

597
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,350
All right.

598
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,910
I'm working with a new guy now.

599
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,830
And I think that it....

600
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,710
I think it could possibly work out...

601
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,670
...because....

602
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,670
I'm trying, Hank. I really am.

603
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,670
I'm trying, but there's.... There's....

604
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,510
I mean,

605
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,510
it's like I don't even exist to her.

606
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,790
Well, yeah. Yeah.

607
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,790
I mean, I know she's struggling.

608
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,790
I know, but I just don't know what to do.

609
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,990
I mean, what can I do?

610
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,190
Such a mess.

611
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,680
I mean, we-- Both of us...

612
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,350
...we just have screwed up so much.

613
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,910
I'm just....

614
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm sorry. I don't--

615
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,790
Do you have any coffee?

616
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,110
- Maybe I can--

617
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,110
- Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.

618
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,870
- What, you take cream, right? Yeah.

619
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,870
- Yeah.

620
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,380
- All right. Here you go, buddy.

621
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,380
- Oh, thank you, Hank.

622
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,630
- Yeah.

623
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,630
- Look, I'm sorry to waste your time...

624
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
- ...with all this.

625
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
- No.

626
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,470
- It's, you know-- But it's-- You know.

627
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,470
- Yeah.

628
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,830
- Hey.

629
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,830
- Oh, hey.

630
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,540
Hey, could you excuse me?

631
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

632
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,150
- Tell me something good.

633
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,150
- You tell me.

634
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,310
Sweated the guy for 14 hours.

635
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,310
That should be some kind of record.

636
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,390
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?

637
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,710
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.

638
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,350
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?

639
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,110
What are you wasting your time for?

640
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,110
Throw a net around that son of a bitch.

641
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,230
All right.

642
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,270
- Yeah?

643
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,270
- Mike, hey, it's me.

644
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,030
- Can you talk?

645
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,030
- I can.

646
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,350
Great. Look, there's a small

647
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,350
situation with the money.

648
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,710
I don't wanna do this on the phone.

649
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,710
Are you available?

650
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,750
I can come by in a few hours.

651
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,070
That's not good for me.

652
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,070
Where are you now?

653
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,310
I'm at the park

654
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,310
with my granddaughter.

655
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,870
Where exactly?

656
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,110
Palomita.

657
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,550
Oh, you know what? I'm not far.

658
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,550
I'll come to you. You just hang tight.

659
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,350
- Yeah?

660
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,350
- Mike, they're coming for you.

661
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,910
- Right now. They're coming.

662
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,910
- Slow down, Walter. Who?

663
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,990
The DEA. The DEA--

664
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,990
Somebody flipped.

665
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,110
They have some kind of

666
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,110
bank surveillance.

667
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,790
And something about some lawyer.

668
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,630
Someone is talking, Mike,

669
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,630
and they're coming for you right now--

670
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,630
How could Mike use

671
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,630
that clown of a lawyer?

672
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,120
Dan Wachsberger.

673
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,510
He would've had better luck with

674
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,510
the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

675
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,430
Always consult with me

676
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,430
before using outside counsel.

677
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,230
All right, Saul, enough, please.

678
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,230
Instead of just sitting around here...

679
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,040
- ...what can we do?

680
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,040
- Besides pray that he gets away...

681
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,790
...I'm open to ideas.

682
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,910
Because if the DEA

683
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,910
catches up with him...

684
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,190
...and he flips, it's good night,

685
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,190
John-boy.

686
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,430
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay?

687
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,430
No way.

688
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,790
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.

689
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,150
This is the second time the DEA

690
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,150
has confiscated his bankroll.

691
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,960
You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?

692
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,600
Look, he won't flip.

693
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,230
But his nine guys will.

694
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,470
Hey. It's him.

695
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,310
Mike, I got you on speaker phone

696
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,310
with the brain trust.

697
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,360
- The what?

698
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,360
- The.... Walt and Jesse are here.

699
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,470
I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.

700
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,470
I want you. I need your help.

701
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,590
- What do you need?

702
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,590
- I got a go-bag at the airport.

703
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,150
Passports, money,

704
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,150
but there are eyes everywhere.

705
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,830
I can't get close.

706
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,040
I need you to pick up that bag

707
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,040
and get it to me as soon as possible.

708
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,510
Do you know how thick

709
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,510
the crap storm is out there?

710
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,750
Told you not to use that lawyer.

711
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,750
He's a hack!

712
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,670
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.

713
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,670
- Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?

714
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,350
- Just tell me what to do.

715
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,350
- No, kid. Not you.

716
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,670
I'm paying Saul.

717
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,670
He can do the job just fine.

718
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,750
Yeah, you're paying me,

719
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,750
and the DEA knows I represent you...

720
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,740
...so they're probably sitting on my car

721
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,740
right now, hoping I do something stupid.

722
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,480
Mike, I can do it, okay?

723
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,480
It's not a problem.

724
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,430
- No, Jesse.

725
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,430
- Jesus, I'll do it.

726
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,120
Besides, you're out, remember?

727
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,510
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.

728
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,110
Hello, Walter.

729
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,760
Before I hand this over,

730
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,760
I need something from you.

731
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,550
- And what's that?

732
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,550
- The names of your nine men.

733
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,670
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.

734
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,670
What's the point?

735
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,870
The point is, Mike, it affects me.

736
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,710
It affects Jesse too.

737
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,710
And we deserve to know.

738
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,840
The only thing left to do now

739
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,840
is leave town. You understand?

740
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,070
"Leave town."

741
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,150
Yeah, I just can't up and leave

742
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,150
like you, Mike.

743
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,550
I've got a family,

744
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,550
I've got people who depend on me.

745
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,390
Yeah.

746
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,790
Goodbye, Walter.

747
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,990
You're welcome!

748
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,830
I'm sorry, what?

749
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,190
I want those names, Mike.

750
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,190
You owe me that much.

751
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,790
I don't owe you a damn thing.

752
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,150
All of this, falling apart like this,

753
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,150
is on you.

754
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,750
Oh, that's some kind of logic

755
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,750
right there, Mike.

756
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,710
You screw up, get yourself

757
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,710
followed by the DEA...

758
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,270
...and now suddenly,

759
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,270
this is all my fault?

760
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,190
- Why don't you walk me through this?

761
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,190
- We had a good thing...

762
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,320
...you stupid son of a bitch!

763
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,320
We had Fring. We had a lab.

764
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,310
We had everything we needed,

765
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,310
and it all ran like clockwork.

766
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,630
- Oh, my God.

767
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,630
- You could've shut your mouth...

768
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,190
...cooked, and made as much money

769
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,190
as you ever needed.

770
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,630
It was perfect.

771
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,630
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

772
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,870
You and your pride and your ego!

773
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,870
You just had to be the man.

774
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,430
If you'd done your job,

775
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,430
known your place...

776
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,060
...we'd all be fine right now.

777
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,270
I just....

778
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,670
I just realised that Lydia has the names.

779
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,670
I can get them from her.

780
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,750
I'm sorry, Mike.

781
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,630
This.... This whole thing

782
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,630
could've been avoided.

783
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,910
Shut the fuck up...

784
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,560
...and let me die in peace.
