164
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,785
Residue is a perfect match.

165
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,170
- So it is the same guy.
- Definitely.

166
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,205
But the thing is, these blades are old,

167
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,840
centuries old.

168
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,009
Do you have any idea why
this guy would be after you?

169
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,762
No, I've never seen him before in my life.

170
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,513
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

171
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,849
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

172
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,083
That's Coptic.

173
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,852
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

174
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,087
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin,

175
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,358
and I've never even left the States, so...

176
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,944
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous,

177
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,446
so I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

178
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,781
I can put a detail on her.

179
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,098
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

180
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,317
No offense, but I don't think a cop

181
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,035
is going to be able to protect her.

182
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,372
No, but we do have a few
friends who could lend a hand.

183
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,939
But we're going to need
to leave Central City.

184
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,609
And go where?

185
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,544
You really want to go to Star City?

186
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,496
Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.

187
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,215
Yeah, I think we do, man.

188
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,833
Man, you've fought
meta-humans with abilities

189
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,501
a lot worse than knife-throwing.

190
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,970
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

191
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,288
There's something different about him,

192
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,724
something, ah, mystical.

193
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,426
Mystical, really?

194
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,261
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

195
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,180
We can figure out what
their weaknesses are,

196
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,799
but we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this,

197
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,601
with magic.

198
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,652
They do.

199
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,770
Mm, this wouldn't have

200
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,238
anything to do with Zoom, would it?

201
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,572
No.

202
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,807
I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

203
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,192
This is the best way to do that.

204
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:57,160
Right. Okay, I'm with you.

205
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,413
But how do we even know Oliver and them

206
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,114
even have time to help us?

207
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,582
How busy can they be?

208
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,035
[gasping]

209
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:08,655
[gasping mockingly]

210
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,374
Oh, gosh, that's fun.

211
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:12,292
I really could do this all day.

212
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:15,262
Open it up.

213
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,831
They could've at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

214
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,101
Serves them right, it getting
stolen and used against them.

215
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,307
Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.

216
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,142
What guns?

217
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,732
Oh, that was actually pretty clever.

218
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,784
Kill them.

219
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,712
"Felicity, the magnetic-arrow
gag will never work."

220
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,030
[chuckles] Yes, it will, my love,

221
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,300
because I am really smart.

222
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,502
And guess what, Oliver. It did work.

223
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,421
<i>Felicity, honey, it's a little hard to fight</i>

224
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:58,972
<i>with you doing that in my ear.</i>

225
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,974
Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

226
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,310
Keep doing what you're
doing. Make smart decisions.

227
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,229
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

228
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,868
Ooh! You know, I got to be honest.

229
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,338
I really thought we'd be
doing this dance a lot longer.

230
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Night-night.

231
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,213
[laughs]

232
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,915
What was that?

233
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,352
[vomits]

234
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,720
Damn it.

235
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,355
Every time.

236
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,307
It's The Flash.

237
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,809
Did I know we knew The Flash?

238
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,861
We know The Flash. Okay.

239
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,863
- I didn't know we knew The Flash.
- Thank you.

240
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,232
But I don't think you ran all
the way here to protect us.

241
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,768
No, not to protect you.

242
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,121
I need to protect a friend.

243
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,727
Wow.

244
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,730
Nice new digs.

245
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,399
Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.

246
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,934
Don't you get cold?

247
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,669
I spent the better part
of five years on an island

248
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,920
in the North China Sea.

249
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,288
I don't get cold, Barry.

250
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,406
Barry, it's so good to see you.

251
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,375
Felicity.

252
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,110
Good to see you, Felicity.

253
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:30,845
How come you didn't tell
me Zoom broke your back?

254
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:34,215
- I... 
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

255
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:35,550
So this is what it's like dating her?

256
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,752
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

257
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:41,806
Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is
impressive, but this is...

258
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,526
This is completely wrong!

259
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,811
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

260
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,363
This is a tragedy.

261
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,365
I'm mourning for the death of engineering.

262
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,234
Copper wiring to handle
the processing speed

263
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,536
from the Palmer Satellite,

264
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,938
or else your system is gonna overload.

265
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,439
Yeah, but that hasn't happened.

266
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,958
I mean, it hasn't happened since last week.

267
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,493
I mean, it didn't... It happened yesterday.

268
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,994
- Hi.
- I'm Felicity.

269
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:07,382
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

270
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:10,719
She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend

271
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,805
who kisses me occasionally.

272
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,093
Right. Um, I'm Thea.

273
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,428
This is John Diggle and my brother.

274
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,479
Oliver Queen.

275
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,897
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi.

276
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,649
Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash

277
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,185
and now the Green Arrow.

278
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:28,570
Do you have any other surprises for me?

279
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:31,322
[chuckles] Please, no more surprises.

280
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,141
Barry said that you need our help.

281
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,193
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

282
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,829
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

283
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,814
What does this guy even look like?

284
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,983
Hold on.

285
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,590
Okay, this is him.

286
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,875
Yeah, see, that's something
I would never think of.

287
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,344
Hey, kind of rocking
that Dothraki look... hot.

288
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,346
Let's see if facial
recognition can find a match.

289
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:58,933
[keys clacking, computer beeping]

290
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,522
- That's him.
- Yeah, strange.

291
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,608
This picture's from 1975.

292
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,610
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

293
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,196
Okay, what else can you tell us?

294
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,981
- He
- aid we've known each other for ages,

295
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,866
but I've never met the man before.

296
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,818
There has to be some kind of connection.

297
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,536
Not one I can think of.

298
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,206
I just moved to Central
City six months ago.

299
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,624
Why'd you move there?

300
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:25,293
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

301
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,528
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you.

302
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,130
Think.

303
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,166
Look, man, we just came out
here to hide out for a bit

304
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,752
until we figure things out,
so you can just take it down...

305
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,086
You came here because you need our help.

306
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,805
This is what my help looks like.

307
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,757
Oliver, I just saved you
guys from whatever the hell

308
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,008
Flock of Seagulls was about to do.

309
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,209
The least you can do is...

310
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,977
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

311
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,646
You brought Kendra into our world

312
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,097
without knowing who she is

313
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,382
or what this dude that is
after her is looking for.

314
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:50,318
You made all of us unsafe.

315
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,820
So maybe you ask the questions.

316
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

317
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:57,659
- We're all friends here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:58,860
Why don't we go back to our place

319
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,995
and have some drinks, and we can talk?

320
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,447
Cool.

321
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,566
What you working on?

322
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,752
This is a formula

323
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:10,538
meant to increase a speedster's velocity

324
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,572
that I've been developing

325
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,842
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

326
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,128
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

327
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,264
You want to give Barry a
drug to make him run faster?

328
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,217
Temporarily enhance the Speed
Force in his system, yes.

329
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,602
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

330
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,054
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

331
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:27,889
Five times I tried. Five times I failed.

332
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,858
That's what you get when
your background is technology

333
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,025
and not biochemistry.

334
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,894
Well, then you are lucky I am here.

335
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,095
What does that mean?

336
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,429
You've been thinking of this

337
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,732
as a mechanical problem,
not a biomechanical one.

338
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:38,983
And what does that mean?

339
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,568
When a speedster runs, they consume

340
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,787
an extraordinary amount of oxygen,

341
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,656
so we just need something
to give an extra boost

342
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:45,907
of oxygen during that time.

343
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,575
Like an oxygen generator.

344
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,626
Exactly.

345
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,245
So we just need a chemical

346
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,780
that's rich in oxygen that would release it

347
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,583
as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes...

348
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:56,718
Something like...

349
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,303
Both: Sodium chlorate.

350
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:00,839
Then all we'd need is
heat to release the oxygen.

351
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,674
Which a speedster generates naturally

352
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,226
in the form of lightning.

353
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:06,978
I think something like
this just might work.

354
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,730
You think you can help me figure it out?

355
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,965
I can certainly try.

356
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:13,634
I'm not changing my nickname.

357
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:14,986
I like Speedy.

358
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,654
Are you familiar with my body of work?

359
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,907
If you are, then you know
I can come up with something

360
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,192
so much better than Speedy.

361
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,745
Why don't you get a haircut?

362
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,580
And then maybe we can talk about it.

363
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,248
I think you're just mad
because my conditioner game

364
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,499
is on point.

365
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:31,252
So the CEO of Palmer Technologies

366
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,037
is living with Oliver Queen.

367
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,540
It's insane how much life
can change in six months, huh?

368
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,208
Which you would know better than anyone,

369
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,160
considering that there's another Flash,

370
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:42,797
another Dr. Wells, from another... earth.

371
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,132
I mean...

372
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,167
Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately.

373
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,769
I wonder what Oliver's
doppelganger would look like.

374
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:51,505
- Bald, pot-bellied... 
- Uh-huh.

375
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:55,843
- Agreeable.
- [laughs]

376
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:56,945
You seeing anyone?

377
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,197
- I am, actually.
- Good.

378
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,615
Patty is her name.

379
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,116
She's amazing.

380
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,018
You deserve someone amazing.

381
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,019
Thanks.

382
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,120

Hey, Ollie, um...

385
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,828
look, I'm sorry that I
laid all of this on you.

386
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,630
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- [sighs] It's okay.

387
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,365
I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...

388
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,000
Snippy?

389
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,418
I have been called worse.

390
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,669
No, but I'm glad that you're here.

391
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,037
I'm glad you reached out.

392
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,973
It shows a real maturity,
and I would know that

393
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,808
because I've never been that mature.

394
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,226

395
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,811

Thank you.

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,936
- You seem really... 
- Happy?

401
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,238
- Happy, yeah.
- I am happy.

I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

403
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:46,778
Being with Felicity has given
me a real sense of peace,

404
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,830
something that I haven't
had in a long time.

Yep.

I wish it wasn't just the dark
times bringing us together.

But it is friends like you

412
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,433
that make those dark times worth having.

Steals my drinks, steals my words.

415
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,471
As I was saying, it's good to see everyone.

We're gonna keep her safe.

Look, there's something I never told you.

424

The first time I kissed
Kendra, I got a vibe.

425
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:32,740
No, not like that kind of vibe.

It wasn't a man.

429
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,580
It was Kendra.

430
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,582
She was, like, a bird.

431
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,134
You think that she's a meta-human?

432
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,952
Mm...

433
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,671
Wait. Why didn't you say
anything about this sooner?

434
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,922
Well, I didn't think it was related,

435
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,641
but I guess now it has to be.

436
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:55,296
Look, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

437
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:58,632
I have this great thing going with her.

438

I just... I've never felt like this before,

441
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,810
and I don't want to sabotage it.

442
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,245

00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,044
I thought this was to help Barry.

488
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,646
It is to help Barry, which is why we need

489
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:35,980
to do test runs on subjects

490
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,183
who once had the Speed
Force in their system.

491
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:40,051
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.

492
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,821
It's not something you can create in a lab.

493
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,906
How do you think you
became The Flash, Garrick?

494
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:46,357
By me and a lab.

495
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,494
Science is what did this
to you, to Barry, to Zoom,

496
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:51,329
and science is what we need to stop Zoom,

497
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:52,330
and this is our only option.

498
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:53,965
Find another one.

499
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,667
The Speed Force can't be
replicated or enhanced.

500
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:56,951
It's a living thing.

501
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,670
It's a gift that was given to me.

502
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,455
That drug... you have no
idea what it's gonna do.

503
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,923
I'm not going to let another
one of your experiments

504
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,424
mess with me again, Harrison.

505
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:05,176
You find someone else
to be your guinea pig.

506
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,628
Jay.

507
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,515
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

508
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,383
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

509
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,585
Wait. Jay just said we
shouldn't give it to Barry.

510
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:17,755
We're gonna do what we need.

511
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,811
The man you're looking
for is Vandal Savage.

512
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:24,863
Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.

513
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,531
Well, who is he?

514
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,483
Some say he was the most
trusted adviser to Genghis Khan.

515
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,784
Others say he guided Julius Caesar

516
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:31,152
through the Gallic Wars.

517
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:34,739
But one thing the League knows for sure...

518
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:35,940
He was there for all of it.

519
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,292
So what are you saying?

520
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:38,576
He's like a vampire or something?

521
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:41,496
Not a vampire, an Immortal.

522
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,581
Okay, we've officially
stepped into crazy town.

523
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,832
Immortality?

524
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,551
Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense.

525
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:50,471
This explains why he looks
the same as he did in 1975.

526
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,006
This can't be possible.

527
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:55,810
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

528
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,962
Kendra, do not listen to him.

529
00:22:57,964 --> 00:23:00,565
I... I just need some air.

530
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,655
Hey, we're gonna do

531
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:09,407
whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe,

532
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,276
whether you think we can or not.

533
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,860
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

534
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,946
I just interviewed a weapons
expert about the flint knife

535
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,314
our attacker used.

536
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:18,366
Found out something pretty interesting,

537
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,285
uh, so call me back.

538
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,425
Harrison Wells?

539
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,793
Kendra!

540
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:32,347
Hey, you going to be all right?

541
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,265
It's just a lot to take in right now.

542
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,334
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me before.

543
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:39,503
I didn't want things to
be different between us.

544
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,022
It's not that, Cisco.

545
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:42,890
If what everyone's saying is true...

546
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:44,609
And it's beginning to seem like it is...

547
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:47,478
My whole life just changed,

548
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,397
and I am so not ready for that.

549
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,483
I hear what you're saying. I do.

550
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:57,288
When I first learned about my powers,

551
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,241
I remember feeling that exact same feeling,

552
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,193
and sometimes I still feel that way,

553
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:05,529
and all I can say is...

554
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:10,385
every day gets a little bit more normal.

555
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:13,304
I promise you.

556
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:17,892
Thank you.

557
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,344
You're so welcome.

00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,862
Soul mates.

650
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,447
We've been partners for 4,000 years.

651
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:04,199
We're drawn to each other in
each life, and after we die,

652
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:07,252
we reincarnate to find each
other again and again and again.

653
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:10,005
And now that I've found you, we
should really get out of here.

654
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,674
Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?

655
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:15,511
These people cannot protect
you from Savage any longer.

656
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,014
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

657
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:23,051
In every lifetime, he
hunts us down and kills us.

658
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,170
He's done it 206 times,

659
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,105
and I'm not planning to make it 207.

660
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,891
Why does he kill you?

661
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,110
His life force is tethered to ours.

662
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:33,812
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful.

663

You do the math.

you're her best bet, hmm?

666
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,286
Okay, so what we need
to do is just find Savage

667

and get rid of him.

Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend.

My associates tell me Savage
left Star City a few hours ago.

673

- For where?
- We're not quite sure.

674
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,838
But I assume after his run-in with you,

675
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,040
he realized he needed
something more powerful

676
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:04,176
to complete his mission.

677
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:06,929
We think he's trying to
locate the Staff of Horus.

678
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,880
Sorry, what is that?

679
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,548
It's a relic from our past...

680
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,936
An ancient and powerful weapon.

681
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,854
If Savage gets his hands on it,

682
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,823
it's going to be nearly
impossible to stop him.

of his pulmonary artery

blood flow from the left lung.
