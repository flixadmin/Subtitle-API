1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:01,786
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,788 --> 00:00:03,687
The prosecution's
smoking gun--

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,804
it's a witness who
is willing to testify

4
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:08,452
that you are
the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,622
It's someone
on the team.

6
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:11,756
Dinah isn't
the witness, Oliver. It's me.

7
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,042
You're off the team.

8
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:15,911
It's been real, y'all.

9
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,045
I'm out, too.

10
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,648
I'm done.

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,017
So we've got them
fighting with each other

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,552
instead of fighting us.

13
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,854
This is only
the beginning.

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,061
Mr. Bertinelli, I think you're going
to like these numbers.

15
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:38,734
We need a name for the Panam-X
that's coming in.

16
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:45,107
Christening ships does make it seem
more legit if the IRS checks it.

17
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,342
Well, how about
The Huntress

18
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:48,977
after my cousin?

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,748
- Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

20
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,588
Who the hell
are you?

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,159
Someone...Important.

22
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,594
Real important.

23
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:06,795
You don't look it.

24
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,197
How'd you get
past my men?

25
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:10,532
I blew them a kiss.

26
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:14,570
Jerry Bertinelli
of the eponymous crime family

27
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,506
and the last
of his kind.

28
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,242
The rest of your
family is either...

29
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:22,611
dead
or incarcerated.

30
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:23,879
You writing a book?

31
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,015
I have heard
that sometimes

32
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:29,818
ships appear on your
docking manifest

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,920
but never
actually arrive.

34
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:34,857
Sometimes, ships arrive

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,526
and never end up
on the docking manifest.

36
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,596
That's, uh--that's
very profound.

37
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:43,832
If the price is right,
maybe--maybe

38
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,500
we can facilitate
a few things.

39
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:47,402
No. I'm afraid you
misunderstand.

40
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:49,271
We want to buy
you out.

41
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:51,840
I got a feeling
you're not hearing me.

42
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:55,377
Port's not for sale.
Take a walk.

43
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,615
Oh, it sounds to me like
you want a kiss, too.

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,428
You have 48 hours
to consider our proposal.

45
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,770
Don't you have a daughter attending
Columbia University?

46
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:24,439
I've always wanted
to visit New York.

47
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:33,904

Hey, you.

50
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,261
Looks like you need this.

51
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,896
Oh, John Diggle,

52
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,565
savior of souls
and bringer of java.

53
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,501
- Hmm.
- Oh, thank you.

54
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:53,902
I have been called.

55
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:57,272
I guess I have to
find ways to be useful.

56
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,274
You're working overtime
trying to find Cayden James,

57
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,243
and I'm still
on the disabled list.

58
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,145
Well, not for long.
Curtis is on his way over,

59
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:04,479
and we will fix you.

60
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,181
We have
the technology.

61
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,783
Ha. I'm not
the six million dollar man.

62
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,484
Not yet you're not,

63
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,286
and more like
2.24 million dollar man

64
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,487
because Curtis and I
are stretching pennies

65
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,122
with Helix Dynamics
as it is.

66
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,694
Oh, speak of the devil,
that little psychic.

67
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,430
Oh. He's early.
He'll be here soon.

68
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:25,033
- Who's early?
- Curtis.

69
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,702
Shouldn't you
be getting home?

70
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,704
Raisa must be making
quadruple overtime by now.

71
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:30,272
Raisa's doing
just fine.

72
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,606
I mean, William
loves her, so--

73
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,275
William doesn't know
you're here.

74
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:34,710
I know,
and I don't like it,

75
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:38,947
but...we need to
find Cayden James.

76
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,383
Are we making any
progress on that front?

77
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:45,520
Despite my 21st
consecutive all-nighter, no.

78
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,155
He's either the first
bad guy to ghost us,

79
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,825
or he's just
biding time.

80
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,960
- Black Siren?
- Another strikeout.

81
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,962
I can't track her cry,
and Cayden must have

82
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:55,530
inserted some sort of
Trojan into the software.

83
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,332
It's confusing our facial
recognition algorithms.

84
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:59,034
I cannot find her.

85
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,902
All right. We will
continue with the low-tech option,

86
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,704
and I will go out
there again tonight.

87
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:04,339
Yeah,
and every time you do,

88
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,174
you are playing
Russian roulette,

89
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:07,743
considering you're being
followed and all.

90
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,378
- And the anti-vigilante law.
- I'm not worried.

91
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,413
You should not
be either.

92
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,582
The three of us,
we will solve

93
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,784
this problem together.

94
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,354
Like your haircut.
It's nice.

95
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:23,358
I didn't get a haircut.
Curtis, it's fine.

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm really appreciative
that you're helping John.

97
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:28,363
No hard feelings?

98
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,265
No.

99
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:36,638
That wasn't
superawkward. Heh.

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,306
Ooh. Let's get to work.

101
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,376
Yep.

102
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:44,846
- Hi.
- Heh heh heh. Look who it is.

103
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:49,017
Ahh. To what do I owe the pleasure?
Sit down.

104
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,989
Uh, well, I heard you
needed a new assistant.

105
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:57,592
Yeah. Developed
some trust issues with the last one.

106
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,495
Yeah. Ollie told me
you fired him.

107
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:02,230
Yeah. About that.

108
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:03,799
He also mentioned that
you wanted to, what,

109
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,667
err on the side
of forgiveness.

110
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,804
Yeah. I mean, look.
You know, everyone makes mistakes,

111
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:12,074
and I--I totally get
why you did what you did,

112
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:15,610
but I just feel like
it might come across bad for optics.

113
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:19,414
It--it might look like
you're retaliating

114
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,049
against a whistleblower.

115
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,185
Yeah. I hear what
you're saying,

116
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:27,055
but, Thea--ahem...

117
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,257
Oliver shouldn't have to
work shoulder to shoulder

118
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,760
with a guy who's
testifying against him.

119
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:34,696
Doesn't mean you're not
still down an assistant.

120
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,365
Yeah. Well, actually,
I hired a replacement this morning.

121
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,401
Oh.

122
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:42,270
What I could really use
is a Chief of Staff.

123
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,646
Almost there.

124
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:55,484
Just slipping past
the radial carpal.

125
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:57,319
Yeah.

126
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,654
Boom! Chip implanted.

127
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,389
That's it?

128
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:02,691
That seemed simple.

129
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:03,859
Yeah, for you.
I mean, making the chip,

130
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,393
that was the hard--

131
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,464
What was that?

132
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,600
Some kind of electromagnetic
frequency interference.

133
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:14,202
- From the chip?
- No. I doubt it, but--

134
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,471
It's probably nothing.

135
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:18,607
All right.
Moment of truth.

136
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,176
Can you make a fist
without the tremor?

137
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,183
Round two, El busto.

138
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,053
You need to just stop pouring money
into this, into me.

139
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,488
You let us worry
about the money, ok?

140
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,323
We're gonna do this.

141
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:43,598
I can tinker with
the design some more when I get home.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Or you could do it here.

143
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,502
Heh. Hard pass.
After this morning's awkwardness,

144
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,471
I am good.

145
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:51,373
- See you guys.
- See you.

146
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,508
Please tell me you can get Halo
on that thing.

147
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,477
If I have to go
one more week

148
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,412
without shooting a bad guy,
I'm gonna bust.

149
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,848
Funny. I always pictured you
like more a Call of Duty k--

150
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,987
What?

151
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,956
Dig.

152
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,366
Anastas,
who collared this guy?

153
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,335
We've had a warrant
on him for weeks.

154
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,070
Nobody. He just up
and turned himself in 5 minutes ago.

155
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:23,939
- Turned himself in?
- It's crazy.

156
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,740
Fifth one this week.
Like all of a sudden,

157
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:28,543
these bad guys
grew a conscience.

158
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,945
Did you like
my presents?

159
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:31,646
What are you
doing here?

160
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,415
Seeing you.

161
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,550
You know, anybody
in this office could arrest you.

162
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,385
Hell, I could
arrest you.

163
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,954
For what?

164
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,956
I'm a Central City
police officer.

165
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,959
The only rap on me
is that I am presumed dead.

166
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,961
Then again,
I was an undercover,

167
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:48,496
so that death is
probably bogus.

168
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,566
The vigilante put
the fear of God in these guys.

169
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,570
At least the vigilante
isn't killing them.

170
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:59,207
Most guys just send
flowers.

171
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,978
How about a stroll
by the pier instead?

172
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,414
Tomorrow after your
shift ends?

173
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,586
Sure.

174
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,121
Ok.

175
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,105
Clear.

176
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,273
What's going on?

177
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,809
We've been
compromised.

178
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,444
Into the bunker
for John's implant.

179
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,947
We got massive signal
interference. We got lucky.

180
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,349
3 months ago, when Laurel
infiltrated the bunker.

181
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,018
She stole one
of Curtis' T-spheres

182
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,086
James had it on him back
at Starling Stadium.

183
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,988
We were so focused
on what she could have taken,

184
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,591
we never thought
about what she could have left behind.

185
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:52,594
- Like a bug?
- Exactly.

186
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:55,363
Then he's been watching
us for months!

187
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,831
I got it on loop, ok?

188
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,633
Audio and visual
of the bunker.

189
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,201
He doesn't know
that we know.

190
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:02,203
- All right.
- I spoke with Lyla.

191
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,639
She said we can use
A.R.G.U.S. for the time being.

192
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,474
That's smart.

193
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,076
No. Smart is
Cayden James

194
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:10,045
being one step ahead
of us from the very jump, Oliver.

195
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,846
I hate to belabor
the depressingly obvious,

196
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:14,916
but secret identities...
No longer secret.

197
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,054
The block between
74th and Jansen just lost

198
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,689
their security
signal uplink.

199
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,123
That doesn't just
happen on its own.

200
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,225
- Cayden James.
- I'm on it.

201
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,833
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can you stand down?

202
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:34,069
I just needed to
get your attention.

203
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,638
You're a hard man
to find.

204
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
You ever consider
a web site,

205
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,476
maybe a spotlight
in the sky,

206
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,445
you know, a big
silhouette of an arrow?

207
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,679
What do you want?

208
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:46,548
You, uh, you know
who I am?

209
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,083
Jerry Bertinelli.

210
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,651
You're in the Bertinelli
Syndicate.

211
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,319
I am the Bertinelli
Syndicate,

212
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,321
at least what's
left of it,

213
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:55,023
and I can't go down
without a fight.

214
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,858
In 5 seconds, you're
gonna be in a fight.

215
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,095
Just hear me out.
Look. I--I never actually wanted to

216
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,497
get in this life,
you know, but we do

217
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,899
certain things for family,
am I right?

218
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,901
Now the ports,
these docks,

219
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,870
it's all we got left,
and last night,

220
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:12,107
these people came over
and threatened to take it from me,

221
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,708
you know, some dweeb
in glasses,

222
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,846
a thug, a woman
with superpowers.

223
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:19,514
I mean,
you know them?

224
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:22,917
- Maybe.
- Yeah. No. I figured you might.

225
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,053
They're looking
to control the docks.

226
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,688
So talk to your cousin.

227
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,524
She's been underground,
so I'm asking you.

228
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:33,962
You really think
that I'm gonna help you win a turf war?

229
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:37,732
No. I think you're
the enemy of my enemy,

230
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,768
which makes us allies.

231
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,442
We need to know
what's on this.

232
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,444
"Hi, Felicity.
How are you?

233
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,046
"Are you busy with anything?
Can you help me with something?

234
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:58,013
You look tired."

235
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:00,049
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,851
Jerry Bertinelli
gave that to me.

237
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,253
The port is the only
thing the Bertinelli family has left.

238
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,122
Cayden James and Black Siren
are trying

239
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,023
to take it
from them.

240
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,992
So we're getting in bed
with the Bertinellis now?

241
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,494
I remember last time
you got in bed with one of the Bertinellis.

242
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,463
It did not work out well.

243
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,332
I have a long memory
for these sort of things.

244
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:17,800
Call me crazy.

245
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,268
Two nights ago,
they paid him a visit.

246
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,903
This is the security
footage.

247
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,772
They made a threat
against his daughter.

248
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:24,073
Well, what's on here
might help us locate them.

249
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,708
That's the plan.

250
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,844
Well, what about
a license plate?

251
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,716
Old school. I like it.

252
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,718
Little bit of old school
combined with some new school,

253
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,053
and I'm about to find us
this Cayden James needle

254
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,255
in the Star City
haystack.

255
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,056
Do it.

256
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:42,625
Then I was thinking
after school,

257
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:44,059
we could hit up the zoo.

258
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,461
They have this new
reptile room

259
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,296
with a komodo dragon.

260
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,498
Thing's so big,
it could eat a cow.

261
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,535
- That's dope, right?
- I guess so.

262
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,103
What's up, sweets?

263
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:56,472
I thought you were all
about this animal stuff.

264
00:11:56,474 --> 00:12:00,509
I am, but why
aren't you going to work today?

265
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,746
I's going through a little
transitional period.

266
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,282
- Will I have to leave again?
- Hey.

267
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:16,992
No one will ever take
you away from me ever again.

268
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,131
- What's up, dawg?
- What's up, dawg?!

269
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,333
I brought crogurts.

270
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,101
- Crogurts?
- I didn't name them.

271
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,536
I just eat them.
Hey, Zoe.

272
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,171
- Hi, Curtis.
- Hey. Go get your bag.

273
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:31,941
We're about to leave.

274
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:34,343
Must be great having
her back, huh?

275
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:38,147
Best feeling
in the world.

276
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,782
You don't look like
you're feeling

277
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,750
the best feeling
in the world, though.

278
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,153
I can't shake how
everything went down with Oliver.

279
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,688
In order to do right
for me,

280
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,323
I--I had to
betray him.

281
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:51,160
You had to put
your daughter first.

282
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,996
She's family.

283
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:55,364
Is that why you
called me over?

284
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,767
Actually,
I was thinking,

285
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,171
all the evidence Agent Watson says
she has against me

286
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,939
has to be digitized,
right?

287
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,541
Yeah.

288
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:09,178
So what if that
evidence suddenly vanished?

289
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,848
Then I'll be able to--
what do you call it--

290
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,583
um, recant.

291
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,586
You put your family
first, Rene.

292
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,556
That's nothing to be
ashamed about.

293
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,825
I mean, now, accessing
might files might be a little easier

294
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,527
now that the case has
been moved back

295
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,196
to the Star City D.A., but--

296
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:29,198
So that's a yes?

297
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,103
No. That's a "let me
think about it."

298
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,704
Fine. Yeah. I'll do it.
We all know I'll do it.

299
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,806
Aw. That's what I'm
talking about, Hoss.

300
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:41,377
Oh! That was--
that was the worst stakeout of my life.

301
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,179
Do you remember--ok.
It was, like, what, minus one?

302
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,215
It was freezing.
I was freezing my ass off,

303
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,450
and the car's heater
broke down.

304
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,052
I warned you about that.

305
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,154
Yeah, you did, and I
didn't listen.

306
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,623
I think there's
a life lesson in there somewhere.

307
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,426
Oh. Ha ha. I think
I drank a gallon

308
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:59,061
of coffee that night
to stay warm.

309
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:01,063
I had to pee
so bad--I've never

310
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,865
had to pee
so bad in my life,

311
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,200
and I had to go back
behind the car,

312
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:06,635
so, you know--
I mean, I wasn't gonna ask the scum bag

313
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,804
if I could use
his bathroom.

314
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,273
Oh, God, and the second
I go back there,

315
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,842
he decides to make
a run for it, that son of a bitch.

316
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,446
I go chasing after him,
fall face-first into the snow bank,

317
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:22,351
and knock--knock myself
out on the curb.

318
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,153
Ohh.

319
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:32,728
This is complicated.
I know.

320
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,265
I'm used to complicated.
Vince, this is a whole new level.

321
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:37,967
It doesn't have to be.

322
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:42,438
I stopped being the Black Canary
5 weeks ago.

323
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,108
I really want to uncomplicate
my life right now.

324
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,711
Just so long you
don't forget to live it.

325
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:04,293
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,428
Text from an informant.

327
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,932
My next target's
on the move.

328
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:13,669
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill him.

329
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,939
Well, just make sure
you bring him in when I'm off duty, ok,

330
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,808
because all this intake
is giving me carpal tunnel.

331
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:37,693
Pen?

332
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,165
I can always
count on you.

333
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:47,202
So Quentin told me
the good news.

334
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,937
You're back with us.

335
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,539
Yes, I am.

336
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,875
And you're happy
about that?

337
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:55,544
Oh, I'm just sorry
that I can't be of more help to you

338
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,580
and the team or
lack thereof.

339
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,982
That's fine.

340
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:02,351
I just know you need
the manpower right now,

341
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:05,354
and I'm--I'm just
not there.

342
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,189
Thea...

343
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,358
You will always
be my Speedy

344
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,294
whether you're using
a bow and arrow or not.

345
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,231
Ahem.

346
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,566
Yeah?

347
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,535
- Found him!
- Where?

348
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,570
His vehicle's parked
outside a warehouse in Adams Heights.

349
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:23,305
Looks like he's alone.

350
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:25,074
And he doesn't know
that we know. Ok. Talk me in.

351
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,342
Oliver, if you do that,
you'll be going in solo.

352
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,912
Let us stake the place out,
do some recon.

353
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,580
We have the chance to
take him by surprise.

354
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,082
We can't pass it up.

355
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,451
- Ollie!
- Yeah?

356
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,419
Go get him.

357
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,835
Overwatch, I'm
in the east sector. Where to?

358
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,871
Ok. You're coming up
on the main floor.

359
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:58,040
Same 3 heat sigs have
been there for a while now.

360
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,175
Good odds
that's our target.

361
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,445
I'm sensing
some impatience, Ms. Lance.

362
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,483
Would you care to
elucidate?

363
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,785
I'm not impatient.
I'm annoyed.

364
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:14,156
We have the numbers.
Why not just take the pier from the Bertinellis?

365
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,425
Oh, no.
Not impatient at all.

366
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:18,627
Mr. Sheck...

367
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,629
No need to
stir the pot.

368
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,065
I think you'll find
that brute force,

369
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:26,435
while it's easy, it's
exceedingly messy.

370
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:28,470
I prefer precision.

371
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,541
Design over chaos.

372
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:34,543
Unh!

373
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,644
You taught yourself
some new tricks.

374
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:13,882
No more games.
Overwatch, I have the target.

375
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,450
That's a whole lot
of bad news.

376
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:16,685
Arrow, you're about
to get some company.

377
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:19,555
- Oliver!
- Overwatch, do you copy?

378
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,857
I'm afraid Ms. Smoak
can't hear you.

379
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:28,163
You see, I also have
some tricks, Mr. Queen, and I have friends.

380
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:31,166
Hello, kapiushon.

381
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,235
How were your holidays?

382
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,270
Funny you
should mention that.

383
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:41,510
Looks like we're
getting a late Christmas present.

384
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,449
I thought you only
targeted criminals.

385
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:54,156
Thought you'd know
vigilantes are criminals, Mr. Mayor.

386
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:57,226
You'll find that
I don't play games, Mr. Queen,

387
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,527
but I do win.

388
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,128
It's enough.

389
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,731
I am so sick of everyone
not killing him

390
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,534
when we get
the chance.

391
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,871
Let him go.

392
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,043
You know,
for a smart guy,

393
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,480
that was a dumb move.

394
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:22,885
There's a time and a place for
Oliver Queen's demise.

395
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,487
Now is not it.

396
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,917
So Cayden James not
only has Laurel,

397
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,784
but he's backed by two
different criminal organizations?

398
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,517
And a deranged killer
that we haven't been able

399
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,385
to put down
for two years.

400
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:40,157
Oliver, if Cayden James
has his own posse, man,

401
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,459
maybe we need to
think about evening the playing field.

402
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,562
We are not folding Curtis,
Rene, and Dinah back in.

403
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,639
I don't trust they
won't compromise us.

404
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:53,076
Cayden James told you that
he wants to watch this city burn.

405
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,445
This is no time
for ego, man.

406
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,047
This is not ego.

407
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:59,883
John, you more than
anyone know

408
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,919
you don't go
into the field

409
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,687
with people you
can't rely on.

410
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,889
Ok. Well,
then how about not going into the field?

411
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,524
They need to know
what's going on.

412
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,059
Dinah deserves to
know the truth about her ex.

413
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:12,629
I agree,
so we share Intel,

414
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:15,098
but that's it.

415
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:23,874
Is that a bottle?

416
00:20:27,713 --> 00:20:30,614
Worse maybe.

417
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,790
Oh.

418
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,726
A photo album.

419
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:46,396
Ok. You've definitely
just hit bottom, Quentin.

420
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,098
I think we need to call
your sponsor.

421
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,701
Yeah. Maybe he can
talk some sense into me.

422
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:53,937
Ok. Well, I've been
in a coma for 6 months,

423
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,706
so why don't you
fill me in a little?

424
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,941
Um, you know--you know
last month when I was held hostage,

425
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:00,143
you know, and she--
she let me go?

426
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:03,580
What I saw in her
is what I see here.

427
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:06,950
Look. I mean, everyone--
even Ra's Al Ghul--

428
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,752
has had moments
of kindness.

429
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:10,554
Yeah.

430
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:14,558
Look. I'm not saying
that this Laurel is that bad, but--

431
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,594
I just can't stop
thinking that if I abandon her,

432
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:19,630
if I write her off
as some kind of psycho

433
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:23,400
and--I know this--

434
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,970
sounds crazy,
but if there is

435
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,672
just some way to
get through to her

436
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:30,407
and I don't take it,
it's gonna be like

437
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,175
watching her die
all over again.

438
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,544
You're like a father
to me, you know that?

439
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:35,979
Ohh...

440
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,915
If you go down
this road, Quentin,

441
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,816
you could end up
getting killed.

442
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:42,786
Even if you don't care
what happens to you,

443
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:45,222
don't forget to think
about your other daughter.

444
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:50,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

445
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:52,029
Thanks for agreeing
to meet with us.

446
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,830
Yeah. I'm not really
sure I see the point.

447
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:55,632
We're out of the game.

448
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:58,802
I don't exactly
see Cayden James

449
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:00,671
respecting those type
of boundaries.

450
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:06,843
Cayden had Laurel plant
a camera at the bunker.

451
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:08,312
We're all compromised.

452
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:09,880
How long have you all
know about this?

453
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,448
24 hours.

454
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,050
You've known we were
exposed like this

455
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,551
for a whole day,
you're just telling us now?

456
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:17,821
Look. We thought our
Intel was rock solid,

457
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:20,023
and then we found out
that Laurel wasn't

458
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,758
the only one
that he's in league with.

459
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,961
He's working with the Bratva
and Ricardo Diaz.

460
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,562
Just what
the city needs.

461
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,198
She's not the only member
of his group.

462
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,670
Dinah...
Vincent's working with them, too.

463
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:42,646
No, no. That's--that's--
that's insane, that's insane.

464
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,848
Vince hunts criminals.
He doesn't throw down with them.

465
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,783
Oliver saw him with James
and the rest.

466
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:50,220
Well, excuse me if I don't just take
Oliver's word for it.

467
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:52,456
I mean, keeping us
under surveillance.

468
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,559
It sounds like he
and Cayden James have a lot in common.

469
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:58,095
Rene, we did that
for the good of the team.

470
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,863
Oh.

471
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,966
Is that how you
sleep at night, John?

472
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:06,837
We are facing
an actual breach in security.

473
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,705
You guys gave up
on Oliver.

474
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,707
You don't get to stay
mad at daddy because he read your diary

475
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,342
and you get to just
skip out on curfew.

476
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,277
That's not the way
it works.

477
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,879
I'm getting sick and tired
of you talking to me

478
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:18,215
like I did what I did
on a whim.

479
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:19,983
I did it for my daughter.

480
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:23,387
And your choice put the whole team
in jeopardy, Rene.

481
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,922
We think that showed us
where you stand.

482
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:27,791
- Dinah.
- Where you going, Dinah?

483
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:29,893
Out. I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you two

484
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:32,162
point fingers at everybody
but yourselves.

485
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:50,881
Move or get moved, hoodie.

486
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,417
Hey. Stand down.
He's a--

487
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,918
he's a friend of mine.

488
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,822
Well, he's
an acquaintance.

489
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:01,091
Business associate?
What do you need?

490
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,859
You going somewhere?

491
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,128
I got a, uh, text
sent to me tonight from inside

492
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,731
my daughter's
dorm room.

493
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,934
Now, Cayden James,
he can--he can have the port.

494
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,536
You're running scared.

495
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,805
I'm gonna run anywhere
for my baby girl, all right?

496
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:17,174
As long as James
and his crew are out there,

497
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,276
she will never be safe.

498
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,977
Neither will you.

499
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,679
But?

500
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:26,783
But I can stop him
with your help.

501
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:31,221
If you listen to me,
you do what I say,

502
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,623
we can end Cayden James.

503
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,235
I'm so glad you wanted
to meet again.

504
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:45,038
Unh!

505
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,041
Cayden James.

506
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:49,443
You don't understand.

507
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,446
You lying
son of a bitch.

508
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:55,816
You were just getting
close to me for him.

509
00:24:55,818 --> 00:25:00,320
Dinah, hey, can we talk
about this somewhere else?

510
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:02,189
That's a great
idea, Vince.

511
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,458
The precinct has
a really nice room for you,

512
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,793
really nice
interrogation room.

513
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,028
I can't let you
do this.

514
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,830
I should have taken
you in the second

515
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:11,365
you came back
into my life.

516
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:19,172
I'm sorry.

517
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:41,161
- Charges are in place.
- So are mine.

518
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:44,831
Oliver, you sure
about this, man?

519
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,768
You don't sound like
you are.

520
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,603
If we do this,

521
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,505
Cayden James will bring
his whole group here.

522
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,874
- And?
- And Cayden will bring

523
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,075
everyone, Oliver.

524
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:56,710
I'm no place close
to 100%,

525
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,879
but, look--
the rest of the team.

526
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,882
- There is no rest of the team.
- Oliver, we can use their help.

527
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:03,884
- All you have to do is ask.
- We would have to trust them,

528
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,419
and we can't.

529
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:07,220
We can't. John,
we've been over this.

530
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:09,523
I know, but we've also
been over other things

531
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,891
like you and
the League of Assassins,

532
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,859
me with my secret.

533
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,729
Oliver, the best partnerships are built
on forgiveness, man.

534
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:17,898
No one knows that more
than you and me.

535
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,466
I got arrested
in front of my son,

536
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,901
got dragged away in
handcuffs because

537
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,536
of something that
Rene did.

538
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,538
I don't know how
to forgive it.

539
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,741
I tried. John,
more importantly,

540
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:29,943
what's Cayden James
up to?

541
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,511
We don't know.

542
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:34,548
He has known
our identities for months.

543
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,517
He hasn't
outed us. Why?

544
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,655
This started with you, with me,
and with Felicity.

545
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:45,592
Whatever comes our
way, we can handle it.

546
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:47,427
I believe that.

547
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,142
Are you actually eating
the old crogurt?

548
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:04,511
Shut up. Your old
is my delicious.

549
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:07,914
- How's Zoe?
- I don't know. I just...

550
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,117
Need her to feel like
everything's going back to normal.

551
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,754
I hope it is. It'd help
if you could delete whatever the D.A.'s got.

552
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,923
We just found out
that Cayden James had the bunker bugged

553
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,825
for a couple of months,
so maybe we should just take a little break

554
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,660
on saying incriminating
things like that out loud!

555
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:22,395
All right, all right.
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:24,364
I'm just anxious is all.

557
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,967
I know,
but, unfortunately,

558
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,935
they have a backup
of all these files,

559
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:31,799
and even worse, the records are saying
that they have hard copies.

560
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,601
- Damn.
- Yeah, I know,

561
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,102
but I'm inside
the system.

562
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,804
I'm just trying
to find--whoa!

563
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:38,806
- Whoa what?
- I think I just found something.

564
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,475
Yeah. There's a record on how
Watson found out you were Wild Dog.

565
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,577
- There's an audio recording.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

566
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,579
Well, that depends on
if you're thinking that Cayden James leaked

567
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,748
an audio file of you
from the bunker to the FBI.

568
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,583
Is that what you're thinking?
That's what you're thinking, right?

569
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,720
- Yeah.
- Good. We're on the same page.

570
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:54,622
Don't you knock?

571
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:56,323
Don't you lock
your doors?

572
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,825
You look like you were
just in a fight.

573
00:27:57,827 --> 00:27:59,593
- You were just in a fight.
- With who?

574
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,029
Vince.
I confronted him.

575
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,598
- He did this and ran.
- I'm so sorry, Dinah.

576
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,468
It was my fault for believing in him
in the first damn place

577
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,170
and for confronting him,
exposing the fact that

578
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:10,704
we know about him
and Cayden James.

579
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,440
That's my fault, too.
Sorry.

580
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,308
Curtis and I were just
talking about James

581
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,277
and the bunker
being compromised.

582
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,612
Yeah, and how that
might have led to Rene being compromised.

583
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,648
You think Cayden provided
Samanda Watson with her case?

584
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,450
- That's the theory.
- A good one, though.

585
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,819
Yeah, but if Cayden
had audio and video

586
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:26,353
on all of us,
especially Oliver,

587
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,489
why would he just
tee up, Rene?

588
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:31,459
It figures he'd go
after the most handsome and charming.

589
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,828
Well, maybe when Oliver
finally takes down Cayden James,

590
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,964
we'll figure out all the details
of his master plan.

591
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,501
Why assume we're gonna
wait for Oliver?

592
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:42,303
What are we gonna do here?
We're gonna sit around

593
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,038
and wait to see how
this all plays out?

594
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,307
Hope it plays out,
you mean?

595
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,242
Are you guys serious
about this,

596
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:51,011
about taking on Cayden James
and his superposse?

597
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,481
I let Vince walk once.
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

598
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,650
And I owe that
son of a bitch some serious payback.

599
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,519
If I'm reading
the room correctly,

600
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:02,423
we're gonna form
our own team, right?

601
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,091
Right.

602
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:08,896
Right.

603
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,408
- What's going on?
- Signal chatter

604
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:11,876
from the Bertinellis' laptop.

605
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,711
They're bringing in
the Red Lions.

606
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,980
Ah. The Red Lions.
Chechnyan death squad.

607
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:18,315
Bertinelli's not
gonna let the port go without a fight.

608
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:20,251
Well, I'm thinking
the enemy of Cayden James is

609
00:29:20,253 --> 00:29:21,852
my favorite death squad.

610
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:23,554
The Red Lions liberated a town
in Kizlyar last year.

611
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,356
Turned it
into a wasteland.

612
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:27,158
We can't let James' group
go up against these guys.

613
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,959
The collateral damage
will destroy the port.

614
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,427
Where are Bertinelli
and the Red Lions holed up?

615
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:33,397
Storage facility
on Fifth and Brockton.

616
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,232
Storage facility
on Fifth and Brockton.

617
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,934
We can take the port
without Bertinelli's say,

618
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:39,403
but there are a lot
of players in this city.

619
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:41,438
I think you should set
a precedent

620
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,240
for when you're
in charge.

621
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,343
I'm already in charge,
Ms. Lance.

622
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,547
Even more reason to use
his corpse as a message.

623
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,415
I concur.

624
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:55,386
Mr. Bertinelli has
his army.

625
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,454
He should meet ours.

626
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,375
- Think Bertinelli's gonna show?
- He better.

627
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:09,427
He will.

628
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:14,532
Well, let's get
this over with.

629
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,134
If keyhole satellite
imagery is anything to go off of,

630
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:18,370
it looks like Cayden James
took the bait.

631
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:38,156
Funny thing!
You guys don't look like

632
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:40,225
a Chechnyan death squad.

633
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,882
We have Ricardo Diaz
in the house

634
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:05,650
but no Cayden James.

635
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:07,552
I'll take it.

636
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,331
Oh, no. We have
a very large problem.

637
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,266
Oliver, get out
of there!

638
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:00,105
Send in the cavalry.

639
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,714
So how does this
compare to Halo?

640
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:12,784
So...Much...Better.

641
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:25,663
Stand down, Oliver.

642
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:27,732
You are vastly outnumbered.

643
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,901
Ugh!

644
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:39,744
Damn it!

645
00:32:56,063 --> 00:33:00,365
Let's get the hell out
of this freak show.

646
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,801
Hey.

647
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:04,769
All right, all right.

648
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:06,905
Don't leave early.

649
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:09,841
The best parts are
always at the end.

650
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,978
I'm disappointed,
Mr. Bertinelli.

651
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,614
I truly am
but not unreasonable.

652
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:19,784
This can go one of two ways
for you and your men.

653
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:21,719
The choice is yours.

654
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:29,894
Forgive me, kid.

655
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:54,152
- Mr. Bertinelli--
- Fine. Relax, all right?

656
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:56,788
All right. Just take the--
take the freakin' port.

657
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,157
Oh, thank you.

658
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,994
Although you elected to betray
me this evening,

659
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:05,697
you ultimately made
the right choice.

660
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:16,941
Which is why I won't
have your daughter killed.

661
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:20,211
I expect you can find
the most effective use for this corpse to--

662
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:24,516
how did you put it--
send a message.

663
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,252
So are you happy to be back
in your newly debugged,

664
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,788
crime-fighting lair?

665
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,823
Cayden James
got away.

666
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:59,093
Everybody got
away. Ahem.

667
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:00,661
Have you seen that movie
"Bull Durham"?

668
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,496
- Hmm.
- My mom made me watch

669
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,131
that movie all the time.

670
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,900
I mean, it is the best
baseball movie ever,

671
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,668
but she used to say
that Susan Sarandon

672
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,271
was her fictional
life coach.

673
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:12,907
Anyway, there's a line
in this movie

674
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:16,777
where she says,
"Sometimes, you win.

675
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:19,180
"Sometimes,
you lose.

676
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:22,250
- Sometimes, it rains."
- "Sometimes it rains."

677
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:24,018
You can't
control the weather.

678
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,486
You couldn't control
Bertinelli betraying you.

679
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:28,589
You know what else
I can't control?

680
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,925
Their numbers
advantage.

681
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,327
I can't be out there
solo against that group.

682
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:37,098
It's--it's not
the smart move.

683
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,166
I won't make
that mistake again.

684
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:44,272
I just want to say
that I, for one,

685
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:48,009
think it's great that we're all back in
the same room together.

686
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:50,811
Trust and forgiveness.

687
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:53,714
For the past few weeks,
I have been

688
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,950
really struggling to
square that circle.

689
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:59,086
I think--I think
all of us have.

690
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:03,658
Rene, as a father, I understand
why you did what you did.

691
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,995
I also recognize
that you might be taking

692
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,531
me away from my son.

693
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:16,270
I reacted to that,
and I got angry.

694
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:20,541
The three of us decided
to put the three of you under surveillance.

695
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,343
I take responsibility
for that.

696
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:28,849
It was without question--
it was a breach of trust.

697
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,685
So was lying to the team
about Vince,

698
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,320
and I'm not trying to
point fingers, Dinah.

699
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:36,090
I am simply trying to
illustrate that there is--

700
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:39,160
there is blame
on all sides here,

701
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:42,563
but we don't have time
for grudges or recriminations.

702
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:45,666
We don't, not with what
this city is up against.

703
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:49,370
So what do you guys
think?

704
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,072
Clean slate?

705
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,409
Clean slate?

706
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,778
Things just go back

707
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,748
to the way they were before?

708
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,883
Yeah.

709
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,719
I don't think
I can do that.

710
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:07,054
Not after what
the three of you did.

711
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:10,358
This city needs us,

712
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,896
and we know that, and we're not
shirking that responsibility.

713
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,265
We decided to go
our own way.

714
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,467
- Wait a minute.
- No, no. Let's--

715
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,235
No, no, no!

716
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:23,571
This is what
Cayden James wants.

717
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,407
Cayden didn't do this,
Felicity.

718
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,610
He didn't create
an environment of distrust,

719
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:32,246
a team where some members
of that team

720
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:35,249
were treated differently
than others.

721
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:39,887
Cayden James didn't
demand allegiance

722
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,056
and then play by his own
set of rules.

723
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:46,660
I came because I want
to be a part of a real team.

724
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:49,263
Point taken.

725
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,432
I'd like to wish
the three of you good luck,

726
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,267
and I mean that sincerely--

727
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:58,439
with Cayden, with Anatoly,
Diaz, Black Siren, vigilante.

728
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:01,409
These people are dangerous,

729
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,710
so whatever you
have planned,

730
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:04,645
whatever your move is...

731
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:09,450
Good luck.

732
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:11,118
Let's go, guys.

733
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:21,495
I may have solved
the glitch in my chip.

734
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:23,330
I hope it helps.

735
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:28,569
I, um, really do.

736
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,526
What the...?

737
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,864
Hope you don't mind.

738
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:59,333
Found these in my
personal collection

739
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:01,402
and thought that we could
add them to your album.

740
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:03,504
Oh, thank you
very much.

741
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:06,373
- It's my apology.
- For what?

742
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,741
You were right.

743
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:10,511
Look. Malcolm was
every bit as bad

744
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:12,346
as this Laurel is
right now,

745
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:18,719
and...then in the end,
he--he wasn't.

746
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:23,524
He changed,
and Laurel can, too.

747
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:26,527
I had no right to tell
you that she couldn't.

748
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,563
Right.

749
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:33,400
How the hell am I
gonna do that?

750
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:38,739
Well, I can help,
and I don't know.

751
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:41,742
Maybe together,
we can find a way

752
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:43,410
to break through
to her.

753
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:45,446
Yeah.

754
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,550
When you said you
had something to show us,

755
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:51,552
didn't you think lights
would be useful?

756
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:52,953
One second, guys.

757
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:56,090
It is all
about the reveal.

758
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:04,565
What does it
look like?

759
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,200
Some...Place.

760
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:07,768
No. It's--it's
our new lair. Heh.

761
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,770
Helix used to
operate out of here,

762
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:12,573
but it's not like they're
using it anymore, so--

763
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,575
Curtis, it's genius.

764
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:16,911
Seriously, nice work.

765
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,746
I'm glad you guys
like it.

766
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,482
Now, I don't suggest
we make this a regular thing,

767
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,417
seeing as how
I'm a lightweight and all,

768
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:27,521
but this event
warrants a celebration.

769
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:31,926
Well, I am just glad
that I found partners who I can trust.

770
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,794
That's what I'm
talking about.

771
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,331
Salud.

772
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:47,975
I'm concerned...

773
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,311
And the feeling doesn't
suit me well.

774
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:53,614
You got the port
like you wanted.

775
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:57,451
Sorry if I was unclear.
My concern relates to you.

776
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,853
Your continued association
with Ms. Drake

777
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:02,022
wouldn't worry me

778
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:06,026
if this surveillance
didn't suggest

779
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:08,996
that she knows
about our association.

780
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:12,866
Don't worry.
I can handle Dinah.

781
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:18,405
There's not a button
she has that I don't know how to push.

782
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:25,746
All right.
New chip is in.

783
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:28,148
Just one second.

784
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:31,252
All right.

785
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:39,627
Doesn't feel
any different.

786
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,428
Well, it takes
a minute.

787
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:49,670
Or not!

788
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:51,538
It worked?

789
00:41:57,647 --> 00:42:00,247
Looks like we're not
as undermanned as we thought.

790
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,849
Yes!

791
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:09,205
