Always a pleasure.

205
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,865
The sex thing was a metaphor...

how you do it, Barry.

Your alarm clock didn't go off.

- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

233

Your alarm clock ate your keys.

- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

236
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:06,006
It was, um, something else

237
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,642
that was far less outlandish.

238
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,043
And I know
I missed the meeting...

239
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,021
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

240
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,380
I think we rushed these cases.

- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

242
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,285
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

243

You need to focus your motion.

You have
a lot of potential, Barry.

You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

The evidence our lab analyzed...

256
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:02,996
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

257
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,567
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

and hard work and focus...

259
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:10,337
Barry was still working
on that evidence. [Laughs]

260
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,039
Think if it were up to you

261
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,007
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

263
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:21,181
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

264
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,350
And I don't think you can grasp
the gravity of that.

265
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,152
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,391
know my full name also.

Yes, from school.

270

Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

Hmm.

283
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,052
I feel like we saw each other...

284
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,788
like a few years ago, right?

285
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,389
No, because...

Ah.

Well, I'm really glad
I ran into you.

Yeah. How...

Sorry, how do
you know about that?

Are you asking for the paper?

- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

would want to know as well.

Well...

my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

304
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,429
Right.

305
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,398
I mean, no one...

306
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,134
would want to believe that
their father killed their mother.

307
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,237
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

308
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,640
My mom should be alive.
It's not about what I believe.

309
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,710
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

310
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,344
Oh, my God.
That's what I meant.

311
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,581
Right.

312
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,481

00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:25,980
Hey, do the thing again.

649
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,247
No, we don't have time.

650
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:31,384
- Mom!
- Shh!

651
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,138
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

652
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,422
- Do the thing.
- Fine.

653
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,795
[laughing]

654
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:42,663
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

655
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:43,698
Now undo it.

656
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,870
[sentimental music playing]

657
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,281
[muffled] I can't, I can't.

658
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,416
Ow.

659
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,853
[Nora] Barry,
are you okay up there?

660
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:07,522
[both] We're fine! I'm fine!

661
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,056
[Nora] Okay, Monkey.

662
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,793
So, do you have like a plane
that goes underwater?

663
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,529
Or like a boat that can fly?

664
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:15,696
How old are you, like 40?

665
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,765
Okay, you don't stop talking.

666
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,868
It's not charming.
It's abrasive and exhausting.

667
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:23,838
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

668
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,338
Just...

669
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,407
do me a favor

670
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,011
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

671
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:31,813
Broski...

672
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:33,781
I got you.

673
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:35,082
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

674
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,383
What do you mean?

675
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,619
What do I do?

676
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,421
I could drug you.

677
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,690
Yeah, I could drug you,

678
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,067
and then you'd pass out,
you'd wake up

679
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,927
and you'd forget
that anything ever happened.

680
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,403
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

681
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,396
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

682
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,398
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

683
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,043
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

684
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,702
I don't want to be drugged.

685
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:57,772
But I'm sure
we can think of another way.

686
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,372
Let's put on
our Barry thinking caps

687
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:01,374
and think of
a different solution

688
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:02,743
for memory loss.

689
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,712
Also, I'm a green belt...

690
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,113
in the Capoeira,

691
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,381
and I have
extensively studied wrestler,

692
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:10,952
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

693
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,162
Besides,
I have a date tonight...

694
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,386
[speech stops]

695
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,390
Okay.

696
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,468
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

697
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:22,029
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

698
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,898
Wait. You say
you have a date tonight?

699
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,666
Yeah. Wait,
what were you doing?

700
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,635
Uh, nothing.
Who's your date with?

701
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,671
This super babe
in my econ class.

702
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:32,840
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

703
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,141
Do we marry her?

704
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,910
You're going on
a date with her tonight?

705
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:37,612
That's why
I need Mom to do my laundry.

706
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,547
You don't even
do your own laundry?

707
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Do you?

708
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,917
Okay.

709
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,752
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

710
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,621
Enjoy your life. Do you.

711
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,756
Change literally nothing.

712
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,034
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

713
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,994
We have so much
to learn from each other.

714
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,461
[thunder rumbles]

715
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:55,529
Oh, great.

716
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,898
Well, you're leaving me.

717
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,866
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

718
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,002
What day is it today?

719
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,805
Uh... Uh...

720
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:06,841
Sunday?

721
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:07,874
No, the date.

722
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,478
It's September 29th.

723
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:13,513
Shit.

724
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:17,051
This storm, this is the day.

725
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,620
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

726
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:21,789
The day you get your powers.

727
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,592
- Powers?
- Listen...

728
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,236
I can't tell you why
I traveled back in time,

729
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,930
and I can't tell you
what I changed.

730
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:31,632
But, essentially,
in my version of reality,

731
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,734
I ended up interning
at the Central City Crime Lab

732
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:36,504
in my freshman year,
and that's where it happened.

733
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:38,239
Well, happens.

734
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:40,942
Tonight, September 29,
the accident that gives me my powers.

735
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,677
And if you're not there...

736
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:44,679
in 30 minutes...

737
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:47,782
then you won't get the powers.

738
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:50,651
Which means
I don't get the powers, maybe?

739
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:53,688
And then, that would mean
that I lose my way

740
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,690
of getting back in time
in the first place,

741
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,758
and then I literally
have no idea what happens.

742
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,760
Powers?

743

[laughs gleefully]

745
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,166
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

746
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,069
She might be our future wife.

747
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,972
There might not be a future...

748
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,840
if you don't come with me...

749
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:13,941
right now.

How are we gonna to get inside?
What are you doing?

753
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,653
Would you stop whining?

754
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:28,055
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

[softly] Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

760
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,685
Come on.

761
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,789
I love phasing.

Well... this is it.

770
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,957
This is where I was sitting.

771
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:39,193
And actually,
let me take this for you.

772
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,694
Thank you.

773
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:42,830
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

774
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:46,700
to clear out the fumes.

775
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:48,903
Right around now.

776
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,871
And I was sitting in that chair,

777
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:52,740
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

778
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,775
And that's when
the lightning hits.

779
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,010
Wait.

780
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:57,645
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

781
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,080
You don't get hit by lightning.

782
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:00,390
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

783
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,882
The lightning
hits the chemicals...

784
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,617
which then you get bathed in,

785
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,386
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

786
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,230
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

787
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,390
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

788
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:10,691
You already have the powers!

789
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:11,926
Exactly!

790

Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

You won't even tell me
why you're here.

01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:11,145
grab Superman and dip set
before the block is hot?

I don't know.

Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him.

Why not? I thought Batman
was supposed to be your friend.

then this would all be
super simple.

1618
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:33,828
- [woman] Who are you?
- Holy Funyuns.

1619
01:26:35,663 --> 01:26:36,764
Hi.

1620
01:26:36,798 --> 01:26:38,966
- I... I'm Barry.
- We're Barry.

1621
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,703
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1622
01:26:41,736 --> 01:26:43,805
But we found you instead.

1623
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,439
What do you want with Kal-El?

1624
01:26:45,472 --> 01:26:46,908
We were trying to rescue him.

1625
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:48,776
Why?

1626
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,646
Because he's my friend.

1627
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:52,980
Do you... Do you know him?

1628
01:26:53,014 --> 01:26:55,315
[whispering]
She looks mad. Get ready.

1629
01:26:55,348 --> 01:26:57,628
She might do laser vision,
or she might do, like, a freezy breath...

1630
01:26:57,652 --> 01:27:00,287
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

1631
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:02,489
Daughter of Zor-El.

1632
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:04,892
Kal-El was my cousin.

1633
01:27:04,926 --> 01:27:07,394
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1634
01:27:07,427 --> 01:27:09,964
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1635
01:27:09,997 --> 01:27:13,333
Clark is his human name.

1636
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:14,468
Clark.

1637

[soft music playing]

1638
01:27:17,538 --> 01:27:19,439
He was an infant when we left.

1639
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:22,442
The last son of Krypton... I...

1640
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:25,813
I was sent to protect him.

1641
01:27:25,847 --> 01:27:27,815
It looks like
he never made it to Earth

1642
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:29,817
in this universe.

1643
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:32,352
Our pods,
they must have separated.

1644
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:33,921
Wait, so you thought a baby

1645
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:36,524
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1646
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:37,992
General Zod is here.

1647
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:40,360
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1648
01:27:40,393 --> 01:27:42,630
- I have to go. [Groans]
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1649
01:27:42,663 --> 01:27:46,366
Well, you need to recover
your strength. Actually, Barry...

1650
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:47,802
take her to the roof

1651
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:49,837
and put her in the sun.

1652
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:51,304
Yeah.

1653
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:53,306
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1654
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:54,776
you're solar powered.

1655
01:27:54,809 --> 01:27:56,443
Good for you.
I've been trying to...

- Oh, uh...

We'll take that with us.

Um, am I cool to...

01:28:12,994 --> 01:28:13,994
turn around?

1661
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:16,463
Are you dressed

1662
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:18,599

Is it loud?

Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1673
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:45,593

Yep, that seems, uh,

1677
01:28:52,934 --> 01:28:54,735
seems strong. You know...

1678
01:28:54,769 --> 01:28:57,470
old man Barry, down there,

1679
01:28:57,505 --> 01:28:59,707
says if we don't stop
Captain Zode,

1680
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,009
he'll kill thousands of people.

1681
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:03,644
Billions of people.

1682
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:04,745
Billions?

1683
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:07,715
Of your people.

1684
01:29:07,748 --> 01:29:09,517
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1685
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:12,385
We came to this planet

1686
01:29:12,419 --> 01:29:14,421
looking for
a safe place to live,

1687
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:16,624
and they put me in a cage.

1688
01:29:16,657 --> 01:29:19,392
Yeah. A lot of humans
are dicks.

1689
01:29:19,426 --> 01:29:21,696
But then

1690
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:23,998
there's babies and ballerinas.

1691
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:25,867
And entertainment wrestlers.

1692
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,467
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1693
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:29,737
Maybe to you.

1694
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:32,506
But I'm not a human.

1695
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,109
I'm a Kryptonian.

1696
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,681
She's gone.

1697
01:29:40,715 --> 01:29:42,482
I have to get my powers back.

1698
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:46,587
If I can re-create the accident

1699
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:48,022
that gave me my powers...

1700
01:29:48,055 --> 01:29:49,633
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1701
01:29:49,657 --> 01:29:52,492
and maybe we'd stand a chance
against Zod.

1702
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:54,862
Or kill yourself in the process.

1703
01:29:57,865 --> 01:29:58,865
Tell me something.

1704
01:30:00,668 --> 01:30:02,770
If you get your powers back,

1705
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:04,038
you can go anywhere.

1706
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:05,706
You can go to another timeline,

1707
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:07,074
another universe.

1708
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:09,442
Why do you wanna stay...

1709
01:30:09,476 --> 01:30:11,712
and fight to save this one?

1710
01:30:11,746 --> 01:30:14,015
Because this is the world
where my mom lives.

1711
01:30:17,218 --> 01:30:19,987
I went back in time to save her.

1712

I'm not gonna lose her again.

1713

The kid doesn't know, does he?

1714
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,861
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1715
01:30:30,497 --> 01:30:32,499
I lost my parents...

1716
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:36,971
but that pain...

1717
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,209
made me who I am.

1718
01:30:42,243 --> 01:30:44,812
I'm not sure I know who I am
without it, actually.

[wistful music playing]

1720

the wrongs of the past.

1722

As if

1723

putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1724
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:02,063
would bring my parents back.

1725

You actually did it.

1726
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:12,239
So...

1727
01:31:12,273 --> 01:31:13,774
I guess the plan is

1728
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:16,077
to douse yourself
in industrial chemicals

1729
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,979

So, as of now,
we're in uncharted territory.

1895
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:01,261
