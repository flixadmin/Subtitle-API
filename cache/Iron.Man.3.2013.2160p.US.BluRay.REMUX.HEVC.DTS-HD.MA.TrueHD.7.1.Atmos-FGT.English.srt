Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1719
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,959
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1720
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,919
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1721
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,754
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1722
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:46,172
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1723
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,508
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1724
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,218
- Doing what?
- (SIZZLING)

1725
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,304
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!

1726
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:56,182
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1727
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,142
Spill.

1728
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,351
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?

1729
01:29:58,435 --> 01:29:59,561
What? No.

1730
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,188
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1731
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:05,567
Something to do with a big boat.

1732
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,319
I can take you there.

1733

(CHANTING)

1734
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,616
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1735
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:16,703
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1736
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,413
Is that...
Is that important?

1737
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,290
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1738
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,169
TONY: So?

1739
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,171
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?

1740
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,130
I mean, we don't have any transport.

1741
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,256
- Right.
- (BEER OPENS)

1742
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,217
Hey, Ringo.

1743
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,054
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1744
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,767
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1745
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,018
But we also have to figure out this

1746
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,811
- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1747
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,188
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1748
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,147
Oh! That's the vice president.

1749
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,690
Thanks.

1750
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:47,400
Hello?

1751
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,194
TONY: <i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

1752
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,237
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1753
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,490
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1754
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,241
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1755
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:57,994
Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1756
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:00,163
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1757
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:03,625
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1758
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:04,751
I think we're good, here.

1759
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,045
RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1760
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,922
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1761
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,674
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1762
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,300
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1763
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:14,552
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1764
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,639
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1765
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,224
<i>- Thank you, Colonel.</i>
- Rhodes and Stark out.

1766
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:23,061
Everything okay, sir?

1767
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:24,896
Couldn't be better.

1768
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:33,363
I love you, babe.

1769
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:55,260
Colonel Rhodes.

1770
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:58,763
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1771
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:04,728
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1772
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:07,605
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1773
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,315
JARVIS: <i>Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.</i>

the suit I'm wearing?

JARVIS: <i>The armor is now at 92%.</i>

01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:20,160
That's going to have to do.
