1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,120
Jack says just a few more weeks and
you will be free.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,360
Stories about you come up
the canal.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,680
Once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,800
You stay clean for two weeks,

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,480
I'll write Linda another letter.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,680
Have you recently suffered seizures?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,560
It is Tuberculoma, I am
afraid it is inoperable.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,560
MUSIC:
Lawman by Girl Band

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
Mr Shelby.

10
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
I only gave opium to your brother

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
because he give me big trouble.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
He attacked my wife.

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
I would like a pot of green tea,
please.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,320
It has taken me ten years
to build this business.

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,160
Your business will be safe,
if you do what I say.

16
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,040
How much opium do you have in
your cellar?

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,640
Five pounds.

18
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
Bring it to me.

19
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
Four minutes against the clock.

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,080
As member of Parliament...

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,280
..for this constituency...

22
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,800
..it is my duty to take
responsibility for the welfare

23
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,400
of my constituents.  Mr Shelby,
the clock is still ticking.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,560
The consumption of opium is very
prejudicial to health.

25
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,680
Women give it to their children
so they can leave

26
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,200
them untended while they work
in the factories.

27
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,880
Men lose their jobs when they
become addicted.

28
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,320
From now on, you will sell

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,000
only cigarettes, cake and tea.

30
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,880
If I hear that you are selling
opium again,

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,760
time will indeed run out very
quickly for you. Do you understand?

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
Yes, I understand, I will stop.

33
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Mr Shelby, the clock
is still ticking.

34
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,880
Please tell...

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,480
..your suppliers and your
customers...

36
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
..that from now on...

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,840
...there will be no more opium...

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,320
..in Small Heath or in Bordesley.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,080
Thank you for the tea.

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,720
BOMB EXPLODES

41
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
You can let them through now.

42
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,600
Yes, sir, Mr Shelby.

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,080
You tell the pub and cafe owners
in Montague Street...

44
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,200
..if there is any further trade
in powder,

45
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,040
there will be no more Montague
Street.

46
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
I will have it demolished
and replaced by apartments.

47
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,080
By order of Birmingham Urban
District Council.

48
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,320
Sorry I'm late, they closed Montague
Street.

49
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,760
There's a gas explosion or...

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,560
Right. Well, it would be nice if
just one thing

51
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,200
could happen in Birmingham that
wasn't our fault.

52
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,120
I have gathered you all here today
because there is news

53
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,440
and it is of interest to the whole
family.

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,480
First of all,

55
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680
I would like to welcome Finn's new

56
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,080
wife Mary to the family.

57
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,120
Right. Well, I'm very glad I dragged
myself out of bed for this.

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,920
There is...

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
..one more item of business.

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,920
Johnny.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
Tom.

62
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,440
Come on, come on, hurry up.

63
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,920
Everyone...

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,080
..this here is Erasmus.

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
Nobody calls me that.

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,440
They call him Duke.

67
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
20 years ago, at Appleby horse
fair...

68
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,280
..I met a girl.

69
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
We shared the shade of a hazel tree.

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Nine months later this lad was born.

71
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
This is my son.

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,960
His mother died on the road.

73
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
Up until now I never tried
to find him.

74
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,440
But I am trying to look at life in a
different way.

75
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,560
A child is a precious thing.

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,280
So I am bringing him...

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,680
Into the fucking family with
a snap of his fingers.

78
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,960
No, I am bringing him into the fold.

79
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,320
He'll have to earn membership of
the family.

80
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,640
For the moment, welcome, son.
You have a seat.

81
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,480
Go on, sit down here.

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,480
There are some mistakes I've made...

83
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,000
..that I can never address...

84
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
..and some I can.

85
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,240
Some wounds I can try to heal.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,520
And new wounds you can open up.

87
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
Anyway...

88
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,560
..that's the business of the day.

89
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Is it too early for whisky?

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
There you go.

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Shelby breakfast for you, son.

92
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I don't drink.

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,120
And I'm not a Shelby, all right?

94
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm a Duke.

95
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,920
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
You're a fucking Shelby, all right,

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,640
don't worry about that.

98
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Mm, I think we will need Curly

99
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,040
and a strong rope to break this one
in, Tom.

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,160
Arthur, open up the shop,

101
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,080
put the kid here on the blackboard,
writing up the odds.

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,600
I can't write.

103
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,200
Put the kid on the blackboard,
wiping off the chalk.

104
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,920
Go on, son.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,720
Come on then.

106
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,560
Lizzie, come on.

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,200
My father was the Duke of the Saxon
Shore.

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,040
My mother was a Romany Queen.

109
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Who told you that, your mum?

110
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
I don't allow people to talk about
my mother.

111
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Good for you.

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
So let's get this right then,
you can't read,

113
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
you can't fucking write,
there's nothing wrong with that.

114
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
What can you do, eh?

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
I can tell the time.

116
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
You can tell the time.

117
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,440
Here, he can tell the time.

118
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Ain't that clever.

119
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,800
It's a lot more than you can
fucking do.

120
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,480
What did you just say to me?

121
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,640
What time is it, Mr Shelby?

122
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,080
That's what I can do.

123
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
You little bastard.

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,640
Here, keep it.

125
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
Stop you from being late in
the future.

126
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Is there forgiveness in your heart
for Arthur Shelby?

127
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
No.

128
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,280
But maybe there will be forgiveness
from God.

129
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,240
And you will do God's work?

130
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
God is interested in you as
well, Tommy.

131
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,240
And God will be with you on your
journey every step of the way.

132
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
He may not need to take many steps.

133
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,320
Tell me this, Linda...

134
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,360
..is God interested in me...

135
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,160
..or in my money?

136
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
I believe you run a foundation

137
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,080
and that your foundation has many
missions across the world

138
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
but in these times of financial
crisis,

139
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,160
funding is hard to come by.

140
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,000
So perhaps your God's plan is
a practical one.

141
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,400
Perhaps he would like me to make
a donation

142
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,360
to your foundation

143
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,760
and in return, he would like you

144
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,280
to help my brother on his road
to redemption.

145
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,640
Now, I know that in a place of
worship such as this,

146
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,880
you would never ask how much.

147
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,440
So I will tell you plainly.

148
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,800
I will write your foundation
a cheque for £10,000...

149
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Praise the Lord.

150
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,000
..if you agree to look kindly on
Arthur and to help him.

151
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,760
I need to look after everyone in
the family.

152
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
Do we have a deal?

153
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,440
Your money will be spent to do good
around the world.

154
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,600
And a mission will be named
after you.

155
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
But I am only agreeing to help
him...

156
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
..not sleep with him.

157
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
No.

158
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,680
Now, I imagine the negotiation for
that particular favour

159
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,040
would take a considerable amount of
time...

160
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
..and I have an appointment.

161
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,840
God bless.

162
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Apologies for the initial
misunderstanding.

163
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,080
My brother dealt with it.

164
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
For the care you took.

165
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,640
Even though I succumbed
to temptation.

166
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,480
Part of the reason my brother is
back dealing with it,

167
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,320
is down to you, you spoke to him.

168
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
As a comrade.

169
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,600
The beating is still owed to you.

170
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,160
Do you still do that kind of work

171
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
yourself, Thomas Shelby, MP?

172
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,800
Mr Stagg, see, I can use men like
you.

173
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,160
I have friends that are in need
of guns.

174
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,400
Soon, there will be a shipment

175
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,160
of Thompson sub machine guns
coming here from Boston.

176
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
And I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

177
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,560
There will also be ammunition...

178
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
..like this.

179
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,560
You have a good look.

180
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,680
And I need you to take better care
of the guns and ammunition

181
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
than you did of the powder.

182
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,640
You understand?

183
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,680
Previously,

184
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,400
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

185
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,120
Now we're dealing with Boston...

186
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,840
..I am considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

187
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
You'll be a very rich man.

188
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Don't you ever say thank you?

189
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,600
Thank you.

190
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
Is that why you do it, Mr Shelby?

191
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,360
Is that why you keep all this going?

192
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,480
To have people say thank you?

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,080
You could close all this down.

194
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,480
You could leave the sport behind.

195
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
You could live like
an ordinary mortal man.

196
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,360
On your gravestone -

197
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,000
"an ordinary mortal man".

198
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
But, instead,

199
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,920
you still go round collecting
"please" and "thank you"

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,120
and "sorry"
and "forgive me, Mr Shelby."

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
Is that what it's all for?

202
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
You want to know?

203
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,360
You want to know
why I've carried on...

204
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,520
..all these years?

205
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
It's so I can do this.

206
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,840
And then...

207
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,280
..do this.

208
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,160
Feel it?

209
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
I feel it.

210
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
Junk doesn't even come close.

211
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
Soon, Mr Stagg...

212
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,320
..when my last piece
of business is done...

213
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
..I will indeed...

214
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
..be an ordinary mortal man.

215
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,720
You have a good day.

216
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Arthur,
we've got a problem with a referee.

217
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,800
He's not taking the money.

218
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,520
He's fucking religious
or something.

219
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,320
Jesus Christ.

220
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,520
With Tommy away, you're in charge
of gambling, Arthur,

221
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,560
what shall we do?

222
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,840
"And this they said to him,

223
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,520
"that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

224
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,800
Arthur,

225
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,120
this referee, he's threatening
to go to the police.

226
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,280
"Jesus...

227
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,200
"..bent down,

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,480
"and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground..."

229
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,920
Arthur, brother...

230
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
..people are laughing at you.

231
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
So I just phoned
our Holy referee - again.

232
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
He basically told me to fuck off.

233
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
Not even basically, actually,

234
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,080
he literally told to me
to fuck off.

235
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,680
Is that right?
So, do you know?

236
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,960
Oh, for fuck's sake.

237
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you know what he wrote
on the ground? Hmm?

238
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,160
No.  Do you know?  No.
You don't know, do yer?

239
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,640
No, I don't.  Billy, do you know
what he wrote on the ground?

240
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,240
I...  Hmm?

241
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

242
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
He bent down,

243
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,000
and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

244
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
You know?
Do you know what he wrote?

245
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
Come on, Billy.  No.

246
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Arthur, what should we do?

247
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,760
Go and get me the referee.

248
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,000
Bring me the fucking referee.

249
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,960
I know she's here with us.

250
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,280
Always.

251
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
But still, it's just you and me.

252
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,520
I thought it would be good
if we were in a different place.

253
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,200
I hate that house now.

254
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
I wish I could blow it up.

255
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,280
There was a time when we'd say
nothing afterwards

256
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
because we didn't have
to say anything.

257
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,560
But now we've got nothing left
to say.

258
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,240
There's business.

259
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,720
What business?

260
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
The American.

261
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,200
He's coming to Birmingham.

262
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
He's stopping over
on his way to Liverpool.

263
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,840
He is staying with us
tomorrow night.

264
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
Frances knows.

265
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
She's making up a menu.

266
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
And then...

267
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,720
..we have to make a move.

268
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

269
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,760
No.

270
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,320
I know enough.

271
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,200
Your book of regrets.

272
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,320
23, 24,

273
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,160
52, 55.

274
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,360
The combination to the safe.

275
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
Regrets.

276
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,800
And I'm on there.

277
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm on the list.

278
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
On the very top of the list.

279
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Yep.

280
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,520
Yes, you are.

281
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,800
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

282
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
Cos I've put you through
so much.

283
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,920
I've put you through all of this.
Ruby.

284
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,160
Everything that is to come.

285
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
When you married me,

286
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,280
you married a man
and you married a curse.

287
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
You have shared my fate.

288
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,800
That is my regret.

289
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
But know this, Lizzie.

290
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,240
In this moment,

291
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,760
in this room...

292
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,640
..I love you.

293
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,840
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

294
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,320
and I don't know
what's inside the box.

295
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
Never have you let me in.

296
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Even though I know
the combination to the safe.

297
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh, this is him, is it?

298
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,240
The one who likes
to be fucking difficult, eh?

299
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,000
When I leave this place,
I am going straight to the police.

300
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,440
You are?
This man pointed a gun at me.

301
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,560
Who, him there?  Yeah.

302
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,440
Well, let's phone the police, eh?

303
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,840
Don't worry. We'll have this
sorted out for you.

304
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,560
Hello? Yes, get me the police.

305
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,160
Reports of a man with
a revolver on Watery Lane.

306
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,640
There you go.

307
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,680
And you ask for Inspector Moss.

308
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,640
Chief Superintendent Moss.

309
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,560
He's in charge of Watery Lane
and Bordesley Green.

310
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
That's right.

311
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
And you see this?

312
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,040
That's his betting credit with us.

313
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,120
He makes a lot of money
from football matches.

314
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,840
Because we give him
the results before the match.

315
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,720
On Saturday afternoon,

316
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,000
you take this whistle,
and you blow.

317
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,880
You give a penalty
to Birmingham City

318
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
in the final minute.

319
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,640
The goalkeeper will let
the penalty go by him,

320
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
and Birmingham City will win 1-0.

321
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,040
All you got to do is...

322
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,920
HE CLEARS THROAT

323
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
WHISTLE BLOWS

324
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,360
HE SNORTS

325
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,280
No.

326
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,560
I won't do it.

327
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,040
If the police won't listen,
I'll go to the newspapers.

328
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm not afraid.

329
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,280
I was in France.

330
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,880
Phone Tommy, Arthur.

331
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
You shut up.

332
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,200
I am not phoning fucking Tommy.
I am dealing with this, OK?

333
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm leaving.
You are going fucking nowhere.

334
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,200
It's time one of us stood up
to you people.

335
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,920
It's not right
what's been happening.

336
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,800
I will not take money to cheat.

337
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,520
Fucking hell.

338
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
In France, I ran at the wire.

339
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,200
And I was not afraid.

340
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,120
I am not afraid.

341
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,480
I won't do a bad thing.

342
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,680
I have seen too many bad things.

343
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,360
A beating will make no difference.

344
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,520
I know that,

345
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,120
cos I can see
it in your fucking eyes.

346
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
HE SIGHS Fuck.

347
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,200
In the bleak midwinter...

348
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,960
Holy Mary, mother of God.

349
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
Ah!

350
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,280
Right, Billy Boy.

351
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,640
You've been in the family
long enough.

352
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,440
Yeah. It's time for you
to get bloodied.

353
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Arthur, you can't.  Arthur, please.
You've been with us long enough.

354
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,720
Arthur, fuck, Jesus Christ.

355
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,360
I can't be that man. Arthur, please.

356
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,760
Either two men die today, Billy...

357
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,680
..or one. You fucking decide.

358
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,720
You hate him, Billy. You hate him.

359
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
You don't know him Billy.

360
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
He's fucking laughing at you.

361
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,400
Come on, hate him.

362
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,240
Look him in the eyes, man.

363
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Look him in the eyes.

364
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,320
I can't. I can't.
Look him in the eyes.

365
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
I'm sorry...sorry.

366
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,800
GASPING

367
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,960
Aaaaah!

GURGLING

369
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,080
Enough. Enough, enough, enough.

370
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,960
BILLY SOBS

371
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
All right. Billy B, come on.

372
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,760
Come on, sh...

373
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,600
Sh, sh...

374
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,400
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

375
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,480
Look at you. Look...

376
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,080
Look at you, look.

377
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,280
Huh?

378
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,440
You're bloodied now, Billy.

379
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,560
You're bloodied now.

380
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,720
You're not going to heaven no more.

381
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,280
They won't let you in.

382
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
Isiah, you take him to the foundry.

383
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
And you ask for Mr Patches,
all right?

384
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,560
You tell him
we got some fuel for the furnace.

385

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
Who the fuck are you?

389
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
Ah! Ah!

390
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
I hear...  Please.

391
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,360
..you're the informant
inside the Shelby organisation.

392
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
And who the fuck I am...

393
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,360
..is the man who you now work for.

394
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,400
Please, please...

395
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,800
I have some things I need you to do,
and I want to impress upon you...

396
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,120
To IMPRESS...  Ah! Ah!

397
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,200
..upon you
the seriousness of my intent.

398
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,440
Cos, you see, I used to do
this kind of thing for a living.

399
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,240
And sometimes I kind of miss it.

400
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,320
Just like Mr Shelby,
I miss the...the wave

401
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,480
of electricity you get
under your scalp.

402
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,800
I miss the taste like metal
on the tip of your tongue.

403
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
I am about to give you
an instruction.

404
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,640
You do as I say,

405
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
you stay a man.

406
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,000
Fail,

407
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,560
and I will send people
to serve your balls to you

408
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,800
on a china plate.

409
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,080
I'll do what you say.

410
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,040
A decision has been taken.

411
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,040
My associates are going to take care
of Tommy Shelby.

412
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,000
And you are going to give us up
his brother, Arthur.

413
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,960
Do you understand?
CORD CINCHES

414
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes...Yes. Fucking yes. Please.

415
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,000
Only information leading
to the murder of Arthur Shelby

416
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,760
will save you from an Italian death.

417
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
Cos it was the Italians
that taught me that

418
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,840
above God, above children,

419
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,800
above his wife
and above his mother...

420
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,640
..most of all,
a man loves his balls.

DOOR CLOSES

426
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Oh...

427
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,320
Hello, Arthur.

428
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
I think we should pray.

429
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,480
That's how we begin this.

430
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,000
You'd like to pray?

431
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,680
The prayer I have chosen is
the Act of Contrition, version two.

432
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,640
So, you're Catholic now, Linda?

433
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,560
You're Catholic.
Quakers don't pray.

434
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,760
Bow your head, Arthur,
and close your eyes.

435
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,080
And recite the prayer.

436
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,760
You know it well
from when you were boy.

437
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,560
Oh, my mind's all dried up
with junk, though,

438
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,120
and shot full of fuck...

439
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
Shot full of holes.

440
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,280
Linda, please.

441
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,760
It's in there somewhere, Arthur.
It's like a song.

442
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,960
Yeah.

443
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,400
Somewhere.

444
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,960
Together, we'll find it.

445
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,640
Digging for the words
will help clean your soul.

446
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,520
I'll begin it.

447
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,800
Forgive me my sins, oh, Lord,
forgive me my sins.

448
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,240
The sins of my youth.

449
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,480
The sins of my youth,

450
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,080
the sins of my age,

451
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,440
the sins of my soul.

452
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,040
The sins of my body.

453
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,200
The sins I know,
the sins I know not.

454
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,760
The sins I have concealed
for so long.

455
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,960
For so fu...

456
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
For so long.

457
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,080
I caught him stealing a car.

458
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,320
And he's got a stack of cash
from the betting shop.

459
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,720
Steal from who you want,

460
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,960
but don't steal from me.

461
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,760
Here you are.

462
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,360
Get a train to wherever
the fuck you want to go. Get out.

463
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,160
I don't ride trains.
Is that a fact?

464
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,360
Well, Curly has a two-wheeled wagon.

465
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,040
What am I, a tinker?

466
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,000
I need four wheels.

467
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,480
And a horse for the hills.

468
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Which hills?

469
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,440
All of them.
All the hills of England.

470
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,440
TOMMY CHUCKLES

471
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,720
Why do you want to leave?

472
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,080
I didn't take to that work
in the betting shop.

473
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,440
Well, you heard him, Charlie.

474
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,440
Get my dad's old four-wheeled wagon
and two strong ponies.

475
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,440
Right.

476
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,280
Curly! Get here.

477
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,440
Before you go,

478
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,560
do you want to know the truth
about yourself?

479
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,360
No. Who does?

480
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, I am going to tell yer.

481
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,640
That spring at Appleby Fair,

482
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,760
your mother stole
my watch and chain.

483
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,560
You're from a long line of thieves.

484
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,480
The watch had the words
"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

485
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,400
I stole it myself
from a drunk when I was a kid.

486
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
I imagine she told you

487
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,840
your dad was
the Duke of the Saxon Shore.

488
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,520
Well...

489
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,680
..I am the Duke,

490
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
it was my watch.

491
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,040
I am your father.

492
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,640
That's the truth.

493
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,000
When her dad found out,

494
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,800
he shot me in the chest
with a squirrel gun.

495
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,640
A scar and a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

496
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,040
That's all you need to know
about yourself

497
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
before you get on the road.

498
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,440
Esme told me the spirits favour you.

499
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,960
That the spirit is in you.

500
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,720
She tried to sell me like one
of those horses, didn't she?

501
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
How much did she pay for me?

502
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,520
I have no use for gold any more.

503
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,480
But if you're a horse,

504
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,320
you're in the right place.

505
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,880
Curly!

506
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
Curly. Hurry up.

507
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,400
This boy has hills to climb.

508
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,760
I remember that watch.

509
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, yeah?

510
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,120
She used to wear it over her heart.

511
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,160
We buried it with her.

512
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,040
Tom. The old wagon's
right front wheel is fucked, Tom.

513
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,440
It's standing in the wet.

514
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Put a new one on, Curly.

515
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,080
Yeah.

516
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
They fix wagons here.

517
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,560
Good families
come from the New Forest

518
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,560
to have their wagons fixed

519
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
and get fresh horses
before the fairs.

520
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,520
Yeah. Yeah, I like it here.

521
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
I like it better than
that betting shop.

522
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Why?

523
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
People.

524
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
People piss me off.

525
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,000
There are a lot of people
in that betting shop.

526
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,160
So far, here I've only counted two.

527
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,880
Uh-huh.

528
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,200
Charlie and Curly,

529
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,040
the rest is dogs and horses.

530
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,760
Curly's half horse himself.

531
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,480
Dogs are OK.

532
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,400
Horses are better than people,
mind you.

533
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,280
There's work here
for a man who knows horses.

534
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,080
Unknown.

535
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,080
I want to remain
completely unknown.

536
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
Well, you'd be in the right place
for that as well.

537
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,200
No-one knows anyone here.

538
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,320
Hey, mister.
Save that wheel a minute.

539
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,680
Where would I stay?

540
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,520
Stables, with the other stallions.

541
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,600
Now that Finn is married off,

542
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,640
there are plenty of girls
round here.

543
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,880
Their fathers
are mostly unarmed.

544
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,000
I have a future for you, Duke.

545
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,560
You already have a son.

546
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,240
My business has two sides.

547
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Light and dark.

548
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,800
I'll need someone for each.

549
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,480
And I'm dark, am I?

550
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,680
I have realised we don't get
to choose which one we are.

551
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,680
Dark knows dark.

552
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,640
And my affairs,
both light and dark...

553
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
..will need settling soon.

554
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,840
Curly? Find a shovel for
the Duke of the Saxon Shore here.

555
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
Get him shovelling shit.

556
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
HE SNORTS

557
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,000
And put some petrol in the boat.

558
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,120
I'm off to meet a lady in Solihull.

559
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,640
# One silver dollar

560
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,040
# Bright silver dollar

561
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,560
# Changing hands, changing hands

562
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,800
# Spent for a beer he's drinking

563
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,720
# Worn by a gambler's lust

564
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,200
# Pierced by an outlaw's bullet

565
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,440
# And lost in the blood-red dust

566
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,040
# One silver dollar

567
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,760
# One silver dollar... #

568
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,000
Take a look at her.

569
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,520
Now imagine ten people
living on side.

570
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
Step on. Have a look inside.

571
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,040
I've had a response
from the Guinness Trust

572
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,200
about building charitable housing
at two sites

573
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,080
along the canal network
between London,

574
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,840
Birmingham and Liverpool.

575
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,680
This lock here would be
the one of the sites.

576
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,960
I have the permission.
We just need the finance.

577
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,640
I know that you and your husband,
Bryan Guinness, are estranged,

578
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,320
but I understand
you still have influence

579
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,560
in the Guinness family.

580
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,320
Your support might help them
make their decision.

581
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,840
Will you help me?

582
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,560
I've booked a suite in a hotel
a mile from here.

583
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,680
My chauffeur will take us there.

584
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,560
You look quite the thing
dressed like that,

585
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,360
dressed like a working man.

586
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,200
They'll probably show you
to the coal house

587
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
to make your delivery.

588
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,760
Yep, they probably will.

589
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Oswald has fucked your wife,

590
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,680
so my suggestion is
about balance and proportion.

591
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,000
It would be only fair.

592
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,280
Can I assume...

593
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
..I have your support?

594
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,960
This isn't about charitable housing,
this is about changing the world.

595
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,800
It's about a different kind
of trust.

596
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,320
Absolute trust.

597
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,360
We have important work ahead of us.

598
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,200
It's much harder to lie

599
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,840
with your body
than with your words.

600
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,560
This, I have learnt.

601
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
Mostly, I do
whatever I want to do.

602
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,320
Sometimes, I do things
for the cause.

603
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,000
In this case, it's both.

604
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,440
Come.

605
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,920
In the interests
of absolute clarity,

606
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,520
that is simply

607
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,040
the English aristocracy's way
of shaking hands.

608
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,560
So...

609
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,080
Welcome.

POLLY:  If you do this thing...

626
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,120
..the possibility of war,
you have to consider.

627
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,000
MICHAEL:  It was the ambitions

628
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
and strategies of one man
that caused this.

629
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,120
POLLY:  There will be a war
in this family.

630
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,320
And one of you will die.

631

# I swear there's nothing

# I swear there's nothing... #

634
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,480
We need to leave early to catch
the first train to Liverpool, yes?

635
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,000
Yep.

636
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,360
So eat early, finish early.

637
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,240
You changed the combination
of the safe.

638
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,760
Why?

639
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,080
Have you got new secrets?

640
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,640
With the new business at hand,

641
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,720
there are some things

642
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,440
that I cannot share.

643
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
What things?

644
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,160
What are those tablets?

645
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,080
The doctor gave them me.

646
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,640
Pain killers?

647
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,600
Yeah.  What pain?

648
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,720
Any pain that comes, Lizzie.

649
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,760
When you're ready, I want you
to tell me everything

650
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,080
that's going on.

651
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,920
It's like
the clock's stopped ticking

652
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,120
and I'm waiting
for the bomb to explode.

653
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,160
We are in that quiet minute.

654
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,960
Tommy?

655
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,240
That's where we live now.

656
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,840
When I know everything...

657
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,280
..I will tell you everything.

658
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Oh, no, Gina's running wild,
y'see.

659
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,920
Harrods, dope, amphetamines,
lords and ladies,

660
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,960
you know, the whole
English aristocracy thing.

661
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,720
Fuck wine - whiskey.

662
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,760
Shelby, you having whiskey?

663
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,000
I'll stay on wine.

664
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,120
Fuck wine, more whiskey.
I'm celebrating.

665
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,480
Celebration, you know.
Getting off this fucking island.

666
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,920
You see, the thing with England,

667
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,360
the currency here,
it's not money.

668
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,200
Nah. You got bored of money
a long time ago.

669
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,800
Cos you know anyone
can have money,

670
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,960
you can fucking...

671
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,840
..you can fucking find money
in the mud.

672
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,240
You can forge money.

673
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,600
Mr Shelby, you can steal money,
am I right?

674
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,360
The currency here, it's blood.

675
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,320
And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

676
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,920
Blood here is like wine,

677
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,120
like the vintage wine
in that bottle. It's the label,

678
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,120
it's the terroir,
it's the grape that makes the wine.

679
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,760
Who fucking cares
about the glass around it?

680
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,320
And you, my friend,
you're an American.

681
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,600
You fucking smash the glass,

682
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,040
you spill the blood

683
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,240
and you spend their currency
to get what you want.

684
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,960
Am I right?

685
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,640
When you come to America,

686
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,840
I will show you things.

687
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,240
You're going to America?

688
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,280
To Canada, Lizzie,
to collect payment for the shipment.

689
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,600
I need to do it myself.

690
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,120
And who will be going with you?

691
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,720
Michael will be there
to watch his back.

692
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,640
Another journey, Tommy?

693
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,320
$5 million, Mrs Shelby.

694
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,440
It's worth a little cruise,
don't you think?

695
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,880
You know whiskey does talk,
Mr Nelson,

696
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,280
and sometimes
whiskey is...very eloquent.

697
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,360
But $5 million, Mr Nelson...

698
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,640
Now, that is a legacy.

699
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,360
And when I come back,
I will know everything.

700
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,840
I see myself so clearly
in you, Thomas Shelby.

701
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,480
You are a man with a bright
and glittering future.

702
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,080
DOOR OPENS

703
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,600
Mr Shelby,
there's a car coming up the drive.

704
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,160
A Rolls-Royce.

705
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,720
Were you expecting more guests?

706
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,960
No.

707
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,320
Excuse me.

708
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,880
We were on our way
to my constituency in Smethwick

709
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,320
and I heard our American friend
was in Birmingham

710
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,120
and that he was coming here,

711
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,840
so we came
to say one last farewell.

712
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,520
Champagne.
We have much to celebrate.

713
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,000
It isn't that I wasn't sure
Mr Shelby would give you

714
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,840
an excellent send-off,
I just felt,

715
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,440
since telegrams and wires

716
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,920
and letters can so easily
be intercepted,

717
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,680
we might confirm all that
we've achieved during your visit

718
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,240
over champagne.

719
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,880
It is remarkable how quickly
our relationships have developed.

720
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,560
So many triangles in this room.

721
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,960
Everyone except from Mr Nelson
is the point of a triangle.

722
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
How am I part of a triangle?

723
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,680
Mr Nelson,
you have all that you came for?

724
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,040
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe is in

725
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,680
the hands of men like yourselves.

726
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,920
And that urgent conversations
between Washington,

727
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,880
Rome and of course Berlin
can now begin.

728
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,200
A two-week visit that may have
changed the course of history.

729
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,120
We have all got what we wanted.

730
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,720
Yes.

731
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,480
And I got what I have wanted
from the moment I set eyes on it.

732
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,040
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman...

733
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,840
..to have each day
what I have only sampled once.

734
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,320
Forgive us, Mr Nelson,

735
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,160
that was a necessary bit
of housekeeping.

736
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,000
Thomas.

737
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,760
We do so hate to be indiscreet,

738
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,040
but we have told you many times,

739
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,920
if you are to seek power
in these days of shiny magazines

740
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,400
and society photographs,

741
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,360
sooner or later,
you will have to find a spouse

742
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,520
who is more suitable.

743
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,080
A woman with Lizzie's past

744
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,600
and personal history
really isn't suitable.

745
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,240
She doesn't deserve you, Mr Shelby.

746
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,240
You know the thing is, Mosley...

747
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,680
..you're right.

748
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,680
You're right,
she doesn't deserve me.

749
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,160
She doesn't deserve what I am.

750
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,360
She doesn't deserve
what I will become.

751
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,040
What will you become?

752
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,960
The truth is, I belong here,
at this table.

753
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,720
With fuckers like you.

754
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,360
She doesn't.

755
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,800
For all I try to hide it...

756
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,360
HE SCOFFS ..I'm just one of you.

757
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,640
Could there be a sadder ending, eh?

758
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,000
# Take a little walk
to the edge of town

759
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,640
# And go across the tracks

760
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,080
# Where a viaduct looms
like a bird of doom

761
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,000
# As it shifts and cracks

762
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,280
# Where secrets lie
in the border fires

763
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,200
# In the humming wires

764
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,320
# Hey, man

765
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,160
# You know you're never coming back

766
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,080
# Past the square

767
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,280
# Past the bridge, past the mills
and the stacks

768
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,400
# On a gathering storm

769
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,960
# Comes a tall, handsome man

770
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:10,000
# And a dusty black coat
with a red right hand. #

771
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,360
I'm here on behalf of your wife,
Gina, and Jack Nelson.

772
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,000
Mr Nelson's prepared
to get you out of here.

773
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,720
But first he needs an answer
to the question.

774
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,800
If the answer is yes...

775
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,480
..you'll be released.

776
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,160
If the answer is no...

777
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,680
..you'll stay.

778
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,480
I have consulted my mother.

779
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,880
Your mother's dead.

780
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,240
Never the less,
I have consulted her.

781
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,880
And yes.

782
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
When I'm released,

783
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,760
it is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

784
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,200
# He's a god, he's a man

785
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,480
# He's a ghost, a guru

786
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,880
# And they're whispering his name

787
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,080
# Through the disappearing land

788
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,760
# But hidden in his coat

789
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,560
# Is a red right hand

790
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,320
# You don't have no money?

791
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,480
# Well, he get you some

792
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,400
# You don't have no car?

793
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,160
# He get you one. #
