1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,049
What happened to the pub
is Irish business?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,247
You shut your gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,931
Eamonn Duggan?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,881
My son and my daughter

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,770
were taken from me
when they were very small.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,604
<i>We're planning an expansion.</i>

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,284
<i>I'm taking premises in London.</i>

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,284
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,806
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,564
<i>We take the opportunity
to show our hand.</i>

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,325
That arrived an hour ago.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,721
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,484
Well done, Tommy.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,005
Now you're at war with Sabini.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,560
- Ada Shelby?
-No.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,251
Your brother broke the rules.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,007
Sabini.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,209
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,329
See if
the bastard's still alive.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:05,529
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,686
No! No!

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,001
It's all right, Miss Shelby.
We work with Tommy.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,684
We're Peaky Blinders.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,966
My name is not Shelby!

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,723
Ready for a visitor, Mr Shelby?

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,401
No.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,689
I'm here on the King's orders.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,684
I'm afraid I must insist.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,321
Ah.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,602
You paid extra for daylight.

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,325
The racketeering business
must be booming.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,291
Are you not going to thank me
for saving your life?

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
Pass me cigarettes?

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,730
Three nights ago,

35
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,246
at the co-operative stables
in Montague Street,

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,524
there was a murder.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,841
A man named Duggan.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,931
The Oxfordshire constabulary
found his body in a shallow grave.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,125
I need to piss.

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,447
Nurse?

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,208
I know it was you who carried out
the murder of Mr Duggan.

42
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,330
Oh, by the way.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,244
Grace, she went to New York.

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,164
A place called, er...

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,245
Poughkeepsie.

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,685
She's married now.

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,763
To a banker. He's rich.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,810
I'm sure she's very happy.

49
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,730
You have been under my microscope
for some weeks now.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,201
I have been observing
every move you make.

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,966
And that is why I was on hand
to save your life.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,644
I imagine being shot by a woman
hurts the same as being shot by a man.

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,129
Just a bit more shameful.

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,966
You know, Mr Campbell,
when I got shot they gave me a medal.

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,847
Yeah.

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,731
No medal for you I bet.

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,891
Mr Shelby,

58
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,487
our reunion...

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,124
...is part of a very carefully
worked out plan,

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,044
which has been in place
for some time now.

61
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,090
Every time you lean on that stick
I bet you see her face.

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,482
And as a result of the information
in my possession,

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,927
I can charge you with murder at any time

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,970
and provide
two impeccable Crown witnesses

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,604
whose testimony will lead you
directly to the gallows.

66
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,761
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,845
And from this moment forward...

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,929
...you belong to me.

69
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,045
So, get well quickly.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,801
I'll be in touch the moment I hear
you can piss standing up.

71
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,322
Then I will send you your instructions.

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,006
Curly, you left the gate open?

73
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,651
No, I locked it.
I pinched myself when I did it.

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,842
- Get that stuff under cover.
-Yeah.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,206
Hey!

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,726
Who goes there?

77
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,087
Tommy?

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,842
Curly, get that oil you put on the legs
when they go lame.

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,570
Are you fucking mad, Doyle?

80
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,290
The yellow stuff. Go on.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,367
They said you'd be in for
another three weeks.

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,442
I need to get on a boat to London.

83
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,000
Tonight.

84
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,046
You discharged yourself?

85
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,361
I'm a fucking
sitting duck in there, Charlie.

86
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,851
Sabini could send a man at any time.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,206
I need to get some things done.

88
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,281
You're burning up.

89
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,286
Here.

90
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,170
Oh, Tommy! That stuff's
for rubbing into fucking horses.

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Ha! I am a horse.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,691
If you were a horse, they'd shoot you
with this many broken bones.

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,521
Get the black powder, Curly.

94
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,726
- Go.
-Yeah.

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,246
The black powder.

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,844
You pay for a bloody hospital
and you're using witchcraft?

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,124
I need to sleep in the open air
and feel the boat under me, Charlie.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,131
Oh, Tommy.

99
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,445
You're just like your mother.

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,885
Do you have a boat here?

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,483
Only the <i>January.</i> She's heavy.

102
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,365
London will take four days.

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,488
That'll do. Can you spare Curly?

104
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,085
He'll be my doctor.

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,885
Then God help you.

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,371
You have tobacco, Curly?

107
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,441
And tea and whisky.

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,562
We'll have you running around
like a colt.

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,722
Ah, get him aboard. I'll fill her up.

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,090
If I sleep all the way,
it's Camden Town we're heading for.

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,401
What business do you have
in Camden Town, Tommy?

112
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,562
Tell Polly she's in charge
while I'm away.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,607
If I don't come back,
tell her she's in charge for good.

114
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,090
You hungry yet, Tommy?

115
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,811
You know what, Curly?

116
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,845
I think I am.

117
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,087
Where are we?

118
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,970
Uh, Heathrow.
One more day and we'll be there.

119
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,769
I'll put something in the pan.

120
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,001
Can you steer?

121
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,766
Give it a go.

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,202
You're almost there, too, Tommy.

123
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,490
Fucking hell, lads. Calm down.

124
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,525
Put him down, Ollie.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,082
Put him down, mate. He's only little.

126
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,366
You on your own?

127
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,921
Seems so.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,445
Well, you're a brave lad, ain't you?

129
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,363
You want to take a look at my bakery?

130
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,491
We bake all sorts here mate, yeah.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,530
Did you know we bake over
10,000 loaves a week?

132
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,931
Can you believe it?

133
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,126
We bake the white bread,
we bake the brown bread.

134
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,965
We bake all sorts.

135
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,965
Would you like to try some?

136
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,841
Bread?

137
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,961
Yeah?

138
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,880
All right.

139
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,769
What would you like, brown or white?

140
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,401
Try the brown.

141
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,845
Brown, right.

142
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
Not bad.

143
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,685
Not bad, eh?

144
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,521
Not bad?

145
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,649
It's fucking awful, that stuff.

146
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,691
The fucking brown stuff
is horrible, it's for the workers.

147
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,807
Yeah.

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,321
The white stuff,
now that is for the bosses.

149
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
Come look.

150
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,282
Well, I've heard
very bad, bad, bad things

151
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,601
about you Birmingham people.

152
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,045
You're gypsies, right?

153
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,211
So what, do you live in
a fucking tent or a caravan?

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,122
I came here to discuss business...

155
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,725
...with you, Mr Solomons.

156
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,521
Well, rum's for fun and fucking, innit?

157
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,001
So, whisky, now that...

158
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,525
That is for business.

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,050
Let's talk first, eh?

160
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
Suit yourself.

161
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,724
They say you had your life
saved by a policeman.

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,564
I have policemen on my payroll.

163
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,005
Well, I don't like policemen

164
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,845
because policemen,
they can't be trusted.

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,490
Mr Sabini uses policemen all the time.

166
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,449
That's why he's winning
the war in London

167
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,491
and you are losing it.

168
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,562
A war ain't over until it's over, mate.

169
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,805
You were in the war?

170
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,124
I once carried out my own
personal form of stigmata on an Italian.

171
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,566
I pushed his face up against the trench

172
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,211
and shoved a six-inch nail
up his fucking nose

173
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,282
and I hammered it home
with a duck board.

174
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,522
It was fucking biblical, mate.

175
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,970
So don't come in here and sit there
in my chair and tell me

176
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,044
that I'm losing my war to a fucking wop.

177
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,803
That war was a long time ago.

178
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,565
You need to be more realistic.

179
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,171
Realistic, yeah?

180
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,121
Realistic?

181
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,960
Well, if you weren't losing the war,

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,042
then you wouldn't have
sent me the telegram.

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Really?

184
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,444
You forget your fucking telegram.
The telegram just said, "Hello."

185
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,249
Very simple,
you want to sell me something.

186
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,207
What?

187
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,922
- We join forces.
-Fuck off.

188
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,963
No! Categorical.

189
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,487
Fucking ridiculous.

190
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,365
Mr Solomons.

191
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,528
Your distillery provides
one-tenth of your income.

192
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,328
Protection is another 10%.

193
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,687
And the rest you make
from the race tracks.

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,571
I know you keep a gun in the drawer.

195
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,130
I know you keep it beside the whisky.

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,806
I know you offer a deal or death.

197
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,921
I know what I'm saying makes you angry.

198
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,282
But I am offering you a solution.

199
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,328
You see, Mr Sabini is running
all your bookies off your courses.

200
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,207
And he is closing down the premises
that take your rum.

201
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,601
And people don't trust
your protection any more.

202
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,922
You're the bloke
who shot Billy Kimber, right?

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,448
You did, you fucking shot him.
That's you.

204
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,842
You fucking betrayed him, mate.

205
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,251
So it'd be entirely appropriate

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,244
to do what I am thinking
in my head to you right now.

207
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,006
I can offer you 100 good men.

208
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,845
All with weapons.

209
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,449
And a new relationship with the police.

210
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,691
Intelligence.

211
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,810
Intelligence is a very valuable thing,
innit, my friend?

212
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,645
And usually it comes
far too fucking late.

213
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,644
Let's say that
I shot you already, right,

214
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,449
in the fucking face.

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,322
And the bullet goes bone, mush,
bone, cabinet over there.

216
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,881
Which is a shame, innit,

217
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,691
'cause that cabinet's fucked now
and I got to get shot of it.

218
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,527
- So, what I'd do is this...

219
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,611
It's fucking simple, mate.

220
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,610
I cut that cabinet in half, don't I?

221
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,770
I do. I just literally...
I cut the cabinet... I cut...

222
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,449
I cut the cabinet
literally in half, mate.

223
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,966
And I take one half
of the cabinet, all right,

224
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,849
and I put it into a barrel

225
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,446
and I take the other half of the cabinet
and all its pieces

226
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,170
and I put that
into another barrel, right?

227
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,967
And I send this barrel off to Mandalay.

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,646
And the other barrel
off to somewhere like...

229
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,165
I don't know...

230
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,806
Timbuktu.

231
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,602
- You ever been?
-No.

232
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,727
No?

233
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,605
Would you like to go?

234
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,401
No.

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,847
You know, I always thought that

236
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,446
you'd have a great big
fucking gold ring in your nose.

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,650
I'm sorry, go on.

238
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,045
Tell us your plan.

239
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,401
Ada.

240
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,484
How the fuck did you find me?

241
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,324
What, are you reading Polly's letters?

242
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,481
Polly showed me the letter.

243
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,609
Look, you think you're safe
because you moved flat, but you're not.

244
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,727
Polly thinks the same.

245
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,804
When will you understand?
I just want you all out of my life.

246
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,927
Ada.

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,889
Look at us, eh?

248
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,331
And it'll happen again.

249
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,925
Yeah, well, next time I'll be ready.

250
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,686
In fact, I want them to try again
'cause I'll shoot their balls off!

251
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,081
- Ada, put the fucking gun away.
-Get away from me, I'm late for work.

252
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,561
All right, fine. Fine.

253
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,081
Just take this.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,161
Take it.

255
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,766
Where you're living now is right
on the edge of Sabini's territory

256
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,968
and all the coppers round there
work for him.

257
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,884
I've got a lot of money coming in
that I can't put through the banks.

258
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,486
My accountant says the best thing
is to buy property for cash

259
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,403
and put it in the name
of a family member.

260
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,201
A house? A whole house?

261
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,961
It's all yours.

262
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,922
Four storeys, eight bedrooms,

263
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,644
kitchen, scullery.

264
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,124
Rooms for a maid,
if your political conscience will allow.

265
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,210
At least go and have a look, eh?

266
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,608
Shoot the fucking lot of them.

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,527
Mr Sabini?
The police are here.

268
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,565
Tell them to wipe their feet.

269
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,002
So why do I have to tell you everything?

270
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,966
We can't search every train
that comes into London.

271
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,131
They don't use trains, they use boats.

272
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,483
The boatmen are all gypsies.
He's a fucking gypsy.

273
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,611
Why do we have to tell them everything?

274
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,723
Okay, we can't search every boat.

275
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,289
Lucky for me,
I have a boy in the Jews' rum house.

276
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,922
The gypsy went to meet Solomons.

277
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,925
And after, they drank
whisky and shook hands.

278
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,764
And then Alfie gave him some salt

279
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,561
or some such kike thing
that means peace.

280
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,570
What exactly d'you want us to do,
Mr Sabini?

281
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,681
Did you bring dog shit
in here on your shoes?

282
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,361
Check, have a look.

283
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,089
I can smell something.

284
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,561
You've got photographs
of this Tommy Shelby, though, right?

285
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,449
We have military ID photographs

286
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,887
from his time
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry.

287
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,246
Shelby won medals.

288
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,127
Okay, so you've got his fucking photo.

289
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,921
If he shows his face in Camden Town,
your coppers lift him. All right?

290
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,646
You know...

291
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Sometimes when I smell something,
it's something that's not real,

292
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,562
it's something more like a...
Like a premonition.

293
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,007
It's like sometimes I smell something,
but it's not a smell, it's just...

294
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,685
...something isn't right.

295
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,003
Mr Sabini, we'll do everything
we can to deal with this man.

296
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,606
Deal?

297
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,206
Did you say, "Do a deal"?

298
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,806
I didn't mean that.

299
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,446
Fuck.

300
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,766
Fuck.

301
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,206
- You've been fucking got at.
-No, you're being ridiculous.

302
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,009
Somebody's fucking sat you down.

303
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,880
Somebody's fucking sat you down
and talked to you!

304
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,645
- Mr Sabini...
-We should go.

305
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,202
This fucking gypsy has sat down
with the fucking coppers!

306
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,281
Mr Sabini.

307
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,963
and you're taking with
both fucking hands

308
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,769
off of me and off of him!

309
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,561
Okay, so now you fucking follow Shelby.

310
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,769
You fucking follow him
and you finish him!

311
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,924
Oh, shit.

312
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,606
I told youse, boys, 'ere she is.

313
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,809
What the bloody hell is going on?

314
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,965
When did you get back?

315
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,643
I didn't want to miss
your birthday, Pol.

316
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,727
Back to work.

317
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,087
How d'you know it's my birthday?
Nobody ever knows.

318
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,731
Ah, it's different this year.

319
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,007
John, Finn, bring the car round.

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,081
Where are we going?

321
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,924
To unwrap your birthday present.

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,286
After you.

323
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,326
Good morning!

324
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,402
You said you were gonna buy Ada a house.

325
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,009
Yep, that's right, I did.

326
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,329
Just had a bit of cash left over.

327
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,611
This is ours?

328
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,651
No, Polly...

329
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,601
This is yours.

330
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,610
'Cause you deserve it.

331
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,170
What would I do with all these rooms?

332
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,520
Well, you could, uh, relax for one.

333
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,490
Come here at weekends.

334
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,721
It has a garden, eh?

335
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,050
You love gardens.

336
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,685
You can grow roses, Pol.

337
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,610
I don't know, have a piano.

338
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,291
Have people round,
they can have a singsong, eh?

339
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,124
God help the bloody neighbours.

340
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,247
Fuck the neighbours.

341
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,205
Welcome home, Pol.

342
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,046
Arthur, why don't you
take the boys outside,

343
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,326
wait by the car?

344
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,726
Pol...

345
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,847
I know you haven't
been happy for a while.

346
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,925
And I know why.

347
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,529
Esme is all right, you know?

348
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,281
She's got a good heart, she has.

349
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,686
I've spoken to her and she told me.

350
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,200
Told you what?

351
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,731
She told me what it is
that would make you happy.

352
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,601
I've spoken to our contacts
in the police.

353
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,160
They have contacts in the council,

354
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,289
and they have contacts with the people
who keep the parish records.

355
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,326
Records of adoptions,
and of confidential forced removals.

356
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,204
Now, with your permission,

357
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,924
I'd like to grease a few palms

358
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,081
and take a look at the records
they never showed you.

359
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,401
Pol...

360
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,251
I am going to find your son and daughter
and I'm gonna bring them home.

361
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,889
That's what this house is for.

362
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,567
So that you can bring your family home
where they belong.

363
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,685
We're moving up, Pol.

364
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,650
Go have a look what you think.

365
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,605
Can you hear that?

366
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,490
Silence at last.

367
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,407
- And it belongs to us.

368
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,282
Mummy, there's loads of chairs!

369
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,280
What's in there?

370
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,205
Still here?

371
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,920
Well, there's a lot coming in
and a lot going out.

372
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,369
Well, as long as there's more coming in,
we're all right.

373
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,130
This came for you today.

374
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,161
It's all the way from America, New York.

375
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,890
Somewhere called Poughkeepsie?

376
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,091
And the decorators doing The Garrison
want paying.

377
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,130
Arthur forgot and pulled a gun
when they asked, so...

378
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,249
- They've stopped and everything's green.
-All right, well, just pay it.

379
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,527
Oh, and we need to put
an advert in the <i>Mail,</i>

380
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,521
Grand Reopening."

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,922
Oh, and you said there's a letter
that had to go today.

382
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,570
Special delivery.

383
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,165
I wrote it in the diary.

384
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,088
Yes, I haven't written it out yet.

385
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,447
Well, you can just tell me
and I'll write it down.

386
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,726
I've learnt shorthand.

387
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,450
Fair enough.

388
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,810
Dear Mr Churchill...

389
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,964
Has your pencil broken?

390
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,604
No. No, do go on.

391
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,091
Dear Mr Churchill...

392
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,764
I've been approached
by an agent of the Crown

393
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,606
to carry out a task, as yet unspecified.

394
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,851
<i>"His name is Major Campbell
and I believe he reports to you.</i>

395
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,286
<i>"Therefore, I decided to make
direct contact with you</i>

396
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,409
<i>"to make sure that certain things
are clearly understood."</i>

397
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,411
<i>"Mr Churchill, you should know that
I am a former British soldier</i>

398
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,289
<i>"and if you look at my war record,</i>

399
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,081
<i>"you will see that I fought bravely
at Verdun and at the Somme.</i>

400
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,845
"Also, you will see
that my actions at Mons

401
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,321
"saved thousands of Allied lives.

402
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,889
"I know that you resigned
your ministerial position

403
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,371
"and the safety of an office

404
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,364
"to go and fight on the front line
with the men.

405
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,569
"I read that you fought bravely,
Mr Churchill.

406
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,608
"Therefore, I hope I will be treated

407
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,286
"in any dealings we have
with a degree of respect,

408
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,485
"soldier to soldier.

409
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,126
"My demands are slight and my sacrifice
in service of my country

410
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,846
"will no doubt once again be great.

411
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,931
"Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby."

412
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,882
Military Medal and the DCM.

413
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,808
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

414
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,688
Hands up in this room,
those who were at the Somme.

415
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,206
Those who were at the Battle of Verdun?

416
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,760
Thomas Shelby was a tunneller.

417
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,450
His demand is rather amusing.

418
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,648
He has asked that the Colonial Office
grant him an Empire export licence.

419
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,969
And specifically a licence
covering India,

420
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,044
Malay Peninsula, Canada and Russia.

421
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,727
He plans to transport
certain manufactured goods

422
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,007
from Birmingham to the Poplar Docks.

423
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,401
And you plan to agree to this demand?

424
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,166
Dear God, Major Campbell...

425
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,726
We will be asking this man to carry out
an assassination on behalf of the Crown,

426
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,600
once more risking his life.

427
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,004
These demands
by comparison are slight

428
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,527
and easily met
with a few quiet words over lunch

429
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,204
with the appropriate ministers.

430
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,682
Sir, with the greatest respect,

431
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,520
Thomas Shelby is a murdering,

432
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,489
cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.

433
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,282
And yet, the tunnels were dug
beneath our feet

434
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,489
to silence the guns
pointed at our heads.

435
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,927
Get Thomas Shelby's
details from Campbell

436
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,800
and get some kind of royal
appointment stamp.

437
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,166
Temporary.

438
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,641
Temporary?

439
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,405
Just until the deed is done.

440
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,607
Agreed, Major Campbell?

441
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,650
And then I can proceed as discussed?

442
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,211
Ag reed, sir.

443
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,250
Come on, let's go inside.

444
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,325
Here, pass the ball!

445
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,960
Come on.

446
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,646
Come on in, boys.

447
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,241
Did you have a good game?

448
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,845
I'm starving,
have you done anything for lunch?

449
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,445
It'll be
on in a minute, in you go.

450
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,648
Go in and wash your hands, boys,
all right?

451
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,160
Come on, mister.

452
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,091
Mrs Johnson?

453
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,321
Yes. Who are you?

454
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,130
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

455
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,520
No-one wrote to me. What d'you want?

456
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,170
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

457
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Can I come in?

458
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,451
Oh, I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

459
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,766
I see.

460
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,490
So what does Henry know
about his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

461
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,725
I only deal with Mr Ross from the agency
and he only ever writes, so...

462
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,366
Why are you here in person?

463
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,961
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

464
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,411
This isn't right!

465
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,921
You're not from the council,
something isn't right.

466
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,287
Hmm. What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

467
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,845
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

468
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,326
She drank too much, she used opium.

469
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,451
She used to beat him.

470
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,486
But that isn't the truth, is it?

471
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,445
Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

472
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,410
Does he know what his real name is?

473
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,689
His real name is Johnson, Henry Johnson,

474
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,162
now I would like you to go away
and come back when my husband's here.

475
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,605
The truth is, he was taken
from his mother without her permission.

476
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,648
Henry, go back inside, please.

477
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,767
Who are you?

478
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,444
Please, Henry, go on!

479
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,522
- Your real name is Michael Gray.
-No!

480
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,364
Your real mother wants to see you.

481
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,487
Her address is on the back of this card.

482
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,367
She just wants to talk.

483
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,283
- Go away.
-She just wants to talk.

484
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,885
Go away and leave us alone.

485
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,360
Go away!

486
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,964
Come on, let's go back inside.

487
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,089
Come on, I'll get you something to eat.

488
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,651
Come on, Henry.

489
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,249
Come on. Come on.

490
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,487
Call yourself a Shelby?

491
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,041
Fucking hit him, Finn.

492
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,845
Hit him, that's right.

493
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,005
All right, Isiah, your turn.

494
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,363
Finn! Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!

495
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,800
Hit him.

496
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
Get him out of there, get him back!

497
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,484
- Get him back!
-Arthur, for fuck's sake!

498
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,846
Get him out of there!

499
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,728
Rockfair is down to sixes.

500
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,081
Right, what happened?

501
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,726
It was a fair fight.

502
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,686
Yeah.

503
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,603
Arthur just caught him with a good 'un.

504
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,365
I saw the body, don't fucking lie to me.

505
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,408
I saw the body, what fucking happened?

506
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,805
I'm not family, I'm saying nothing.

507
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,041
Arthur...

508
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,289
He's blown a few times lately.

509
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,963
Six, seven.

510
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,088
It's like he's not there in the head.

511
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,011
He can't even hear "stop".

512
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,971
Even his own name.

513
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,925
And then he cries.

514
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,041
Right, listen to me.

515
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,249
That's two fucking stories.

516
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,887
Your brother killed a boy.

517
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,281
There were witnesses,
there will be questions,

518
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,367
get your story straight,
it was an accident.

519
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,041
Fuck off.

520
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,606
I spoke to the doctor,

521
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,729
he said the kid
probably had a weak heart.

522
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,165
We'll look after his mother.

523
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,926
It'll be fine.

524
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,487
Polly said I should have stuck
with the medicine.

525
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,088
I said that you know best.

526
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,248
It's like a fucking boat, Tommy.

527
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,046
Full of heavy cargo, like coal or iron.

528
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,928
Sometimes it slips to one end.

529
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,085
And the boat tips.

530
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,210
I can feel it slipping.

531
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,207
And I can feel the boat tipping.

532
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,963
But there ain't nothing
I can do about it.

533
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,650
It's like me fuckin' head’s just like
this fuckin' black fucking barge!

534
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,241
And it just fucking drifts

535
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,529
in and out, in and out.

536
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,001
Well, we're home
a long time now, Arthur.

537
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,005
We're home a long time.

538
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,761
- I thought you were all right.
-Yeah, well...

539
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,170
I, I, I don't think I am, Tommy.

540
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,560
Take this fucking thing away from me.

541
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,085
Just fuck off, Arthur.

542
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,201
You know what?

543
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,286
I've had enough.

544
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,644
I've fucking had enough.

545
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,883
Just fuck off!

546
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,481
What?

547
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,725
I'm supposed to treat you
like a fucking kid again, eh?

548
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,601
Keep you away from guns
and fucking rope, is that it?

549
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,403
You think
I haven't got enough on!

550
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,641
- Stop it, Tommy.
-Arthur?

551
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,609
You think I haven't got enough on?

552
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,603
- Stop it.
-The war is done!

553
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,330
- Shut the door on it!
-Stop it.

554
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,210
Shut the door on it like I did, eh?

555
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,805
- Can you do that?
-Yeah?

556
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,041
- Like I fucking did.
-I'm not fucking you.

557
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,203
- Shut the fucking door, eh?
-But I'm not fucking you!

558
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,090
I am not fucking you!

559
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,242
Everyone fucking knows it!

560
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,606
God!

561
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,563
Look at yourself. Eh?

562
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,048
Look at yourself.

563
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,923
Take a long, hard,
fucking look at yourself.

564
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,481
Time for lunch, sir.

565
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,201
I thought we could eat at the desk,
like the old days.

566
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,370
You remembered.

567
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,205
Tongue and pickle, sir.

568
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,162
But it's the single stroke
of mustard, that's the thing.

569
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,561
- Hmm.
-The fine detail.

570
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,925
Speaking of detail...

571
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,407
How much is Thomas Shelby
paying you in bribes per week?

572
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,481
Hmm?

573
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,003
Actually, I already know.

574
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,967
Two pounds a week, eight pounds a month,
plus extras for specific favours.

575
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,244
When I left, you were an honest man.

576
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,688
And now you're on
the Peaky Blinders' payroll.

577
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,010
Shelby is a worm and feeds off
the rotten parts of your mind.

578
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,687
He gets in through your ear,
with a whisper.

579
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,005
He crawls in over your tongue as you
lie to the judge and the pastor.

580
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,641
Mr Moss...

581
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,365
We are entering a bloody phase
of a bloody war

582
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,568
with no quarter asked or given.

583
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,963
But as of this moment, you are now
back on the side of the angels.

584
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,886
Shelby thinks you work for him,
but in truth, you work for me.

585
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,963
And I will use you mercilessly.

586
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,690
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

587
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,605
As you can see, one is white...

588
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,165
...and one is black.

589
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,884
What you saw in your dreams...

590
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,320
...was right.

591
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,645
Your daughter is dead.

592
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,441
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

593
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,969
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

594
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,369
With a family of a
railway station master in Stafford.

595
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,287
She never settled.

596
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,442
So she kept running away.

597
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,448
She got on a train to Birmingham once...

598
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,531
Eventually they sent her to Australia

599
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,771
where she died of something
called spring fever.

600
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,564
So my little Anna travelled
all the way back across the world

601
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,444
to be with me in my dreams?

602
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,445
She came all by herself.

603
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,126
Well...

604
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,643
That's one train
they couldn't get her off.

605
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,409
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

606
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,401
He's in England...

607
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,124
...and I know where he lives,
I went there.

608
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,010
- But, Pol...
-And?

609
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,930
Okay, Polly, listen to me.

610
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,688
Just listen to me, please.

611
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,161
Pol!

612
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,409
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

613
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,769
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

614
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,087
Polly, if you go there and you get mad

615
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,046
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

616
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,447
they will never let you
anywhere near him

617
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,931
and the boy will get scared.

618
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,884
That's what will happen, Pol.

619
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,207
Polly.

620
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,561
Polly...

621
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,766
You just tell me where he is, Thomas.

622
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,006
Tell me where he is, Thomas!

623
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,480
Polly...

624
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,686
Pulling the gun...

625
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,608
Pulling the gun is why I can't tell you.

626
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,202
Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

627
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,682
Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.

628
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,926
Wait!

629
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,525
You tell me where he is!

630
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,762
If you shoot me, you'll never know.

631
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,847
Mickey!
Hurry up, the party's starting.

632
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,481
Good, carry on.

633
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,686
Finn, where you going?

634
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,728
- To talk to Arthur.
-Right.

635
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,446
Arthur?

636
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,160
Go away.

637
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,680
What's wrong? Why aren't you ready?

638
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,046
For what?

639
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,005
The Garrison.

640
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,925
The reopening of your pub. It's tonight.

641
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,771
Tommy don't want me there.

642
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,127
It was Tommy who told me to get you.

643
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,449
He says it's your name above that door,
so you've got to be there.

644
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,490
No... No, look at me.

645
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,006
I'm staying away.

646
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,561
Go away.

647
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,480
Get out.

648
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,401
I told you to go away.

649
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,764
Sometimes,

650
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,041
when we boys are feeling blue,

651
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,051
this is what we do.

652
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,571
It's called Tokyo.

653
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,724
It's good stuff, Arthur.

654
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,526
It'll help you.

655
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,445
For special occasions.

656
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,647
Oh, boys!

657
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,202
My fucking Garrison!

658
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,248
Take that. Take that an' all.

659
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,846
'Ere you are, Lizzie.
Let me get you a light.

660
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,331
There you go, my darling.

661
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,289
Jeremiah, I'll be with you in a second.

662
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,566
Oh!

663
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,884
Look at the place!

664
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,361
You all right?

665
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,442
Busier we are, the faster time passes.

666
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,726
Yeah?

667
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,530
Arthur. Tokyo, it's fuel for races, eh?

668
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,682
But you've seen
a doped horse after a race...

669
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,921
Oh, yeah.

670
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,762
Grand openings
and race days only, brother.

671
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,961
- All right?
-Go on then, Tommy!

672
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,327
- There you go, come on, drink up.
-Boys.

673
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,445
- All right, Mick?
-Tom.

674
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,207
Finn! Gimme that.

675
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,284
Keep him off the whisky, John.

676
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,041
Pol.

677
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,246
Ada! I didn't know you were coming.

678
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,526
- There's Aunt Polly.
-Aw.

679
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,761
Hi!

680
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,724
Hey, who's that?

681
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,326
D'you want a cuddle?

682
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,607
Polly, that's right. Take him. Polly...

683
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,887
Oh, Ada, why don't you think
about coming home?

684
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,007
Hello, Ada.

685
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,606
Say you'd...

686
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,651
- Tommy...

687
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,611
So what do you think, eh?

688
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,166
It's very...

689
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,289
- Gold?
-Yeah.

690
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,087
Hello, Ada.

691
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,650
Hello, trouble, how're you doing?

692
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,041
- Mmm.
-Oh, you're spilling my drink!

693
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,804
Hey, Arthur, look who it is.

694
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,690
So what d'you want me to say to her?

695
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,171
Just talk to her.

696
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,404
No one can get through to her.

697
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,006
Tell her I had no choice.

698
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,961
I appreciate this.

699
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,485
- Hello, brother.
-Ada, come here, you!

700
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,365
You big bear!

701
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,371
Polly? Why don't you come and join us?

702
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,090
- What?
-I'm not an idiot.

703
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,209
He asked you to come, didn't he?

704
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,607
I don't want conversation,
I want an address.

705
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,850
Until I have that,
I've not got anything to say.

706
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,844
Now, it's a party!

707
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,122
Yeah, it is! Oh!

708
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,564
And I'm going to enjoy myself.

709
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,210
No, Pol, don't be silly.

710
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,601
Excuse me?

711
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,125
Would you care to dance?

712
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,448
It'd be my pleasure.

713
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,688
My love, pleasure hasn't even begun.

714
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,011
Excuse me?

715
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,842
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

716
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,648
I was told she lived here at number 17.

717
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,407
I came last night
but there was nobody here.

718
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,606
So I waited.

719
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,489
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

720
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,485
I think she might be my mother.

721
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:30,085
