or does she just rewind automatically?

307

We're looking for an employee of WellZyn's.

308
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,281
Male, with a severely damaged ear.

Yes. Full disclosure, that does raise a flag.

That's Stan Potolsky.

311

He worked for us for several years
as a biochemist.

Shampoos, toothpastes.

So, what happened?

314
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,124
Stan was frustrated that he wasn't
doing more important work.

315
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,009
He grew disgruntled and unstable.
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

316

Last April, there was an incident.

317
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,449
He tried to cut off his own ear
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

318
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,608
Guess it was harder than he thought.

319
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,165
We had to let him go.

REECE: After he was terminated...

...he didn't even clear off his desk.

You knew all along it was him.
That's why you came to see us so fast.

You'd better know what story, my friend.

Because if you tell me
the same story he told me...
