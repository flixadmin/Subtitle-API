Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,660
I'll take this.

3
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,510
Sorry about all the...

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,060
Don't be stupid.
You did us a favour.

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,110
- What are we gonna do with him?
- We'll take care of it.

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,860
The tracking chip.

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,360
Already disabled.

8
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,240
Sit down and relax, Petit Hughie.

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,550
Oi, where you think you're going?

10
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,880
- I'm going home. I need clothes.
- We'll get you clothes.

11
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,970
I want my clothes.

12
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,220
I'll be right back.

13
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,720
You are, perhaps... in a
state of shock, mon ami.

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,100
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

15
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,350
You can't just piss off.

16
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,360
I need to go home.

17
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,740
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

18
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,910
Wait, what? No.

19
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,790
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

20
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,380
Good lad.

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,050
Translucent's skin, it won't burn off.

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,310
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

23
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,930
Nowhere.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,020
But we can slow the cunt down a bit.

25
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,160
Come on in.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,910
Ms Stillwell. Hello.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,210
Please sit.

28
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,300
Starlight, that video...

29
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,100
- Ms Stillwell, please.
- No, no. Let me finish.

30
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,180
The date-rape girl? The victim?

31
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,100
She saw that video on YouTube

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,560
and she came forward to thank you.

33
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,110
She could not have been more effusive.

34
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,320
That's... That's good, right?

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,570
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

36
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,870
You have a huge boost with men,
for the ass-kicking, of course,

37
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,740
but with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

38
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,370
Sixteen points with females 18 to 49,

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,880
even in the liberal retreat jurisdictions
like New York and San Francisco.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,670
- I don't know what to say.
- You just have to enjoy this.

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,800
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,800
because it is a partnership, after all.

43
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,470
- This is Seth and Evan from Marketing.
- Hi.

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,230
They have some brilliant ideas on how to
capitalise on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

45
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,270
- Okay. So...
- Yeah.

46
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,070
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

47
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,110
is chosen for the Seven.

48
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,190
Destiny knocks on
the girl next door's door,

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,200
and she answers, to
fight for truth and justice

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,530
- side by side with her heroes.
- The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

51
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,370
It's got worms. Muggers and rapists
and thieves, my.

52
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,710
Dorothy is not in Kansas anymore.

53
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,130
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked around
something fierce.

54
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,380
Kicked while she's down.

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,590
So what does she do?
Does she cry in her milk?

56
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,130
- Does she quit?
- No way!

57
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,550
She adapts! She transforms!

58
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,550
Embraces her feminine strengths.

59
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,050
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.

60
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,430
And hello, Starlight.

61
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,270
- I can't wear that.
- What?

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,490
- Why not? It's beautiful.
- Seriously?

63
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,530
It's just...

64
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,620
It's not me.

65
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,780
I designed Homelander's suit.

66
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,950
- This isn't my first rodeo.
- You're wrong.

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,830
It's totally you.
It's bold, it's brave, it's feminist.

68
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,380
- How is that feminist?
- Empowering.

69
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,210
It says you're confident in your own skin,
and you're not afraid to show it.

70
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,840
Most importantly, it tells the story.

71
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,640
Of your transformation...
of what you're going through.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,890
How exactly do you know
what I'm going through, exactly?

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm sorry. I appreciate the effort,

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,650
I really do, but I'm
fine with my old outfit.

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,110
- We're not.
- Excuse me?

76
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,910
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

77
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,160
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
It's my body.

79
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,210
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

80
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,040
That is true. You do.

81
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,840
You just won't be doing it in the Seven...

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,340
unless it is wrapped in that.

83
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,810
Tomorrow, A-Train versus Shockwave.

84
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,430
The race of the century.

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,600
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

86
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,190
as the fastest man alive?

87
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,270
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,070
at the hands of this
fresh-faced young challenger?

89
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,150
Just wait here, okay?

90
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,950
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,
the race of the century.

91
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,030
Well, Shockwave...

92
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,370
Hughie?

93
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,910
Hey, Dad.

94
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,120
Look at the...

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
- You've... This is...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about this.

96
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,040
I just... I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

97
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,500
for a while now, so...

98
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,050
What, are you going somewhere?

99
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,390
- Yeah. For a while.
- Where?

100
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,180
I don't know.

101
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,430
Well, now, you're scaring me, Hugh.

102
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,350
All right, now, I spoke to Dr Feldman...

103
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,770
- My paediatrician?
- He's still your doctor.

104
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,400
And he's given me the name
of someone you can talk to.

105
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Help you, you know, get back to normal.

106
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,240
There's no normal anymore.

107
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
What do you mean, there's...? Look.

108
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,240
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

109
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,660
We've always told
each other everything.

110
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,750
- Talk to me.
- Stop it.

111
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,790
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Stop it.

112
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,920
I have never told you everything.

113
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,670
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,590
staring at the TV like we're already dead.

115
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,220
How much I fucking hate Pizza Rolls.

116
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,100
- No, you love Pizza Rolls.
- When I was 7!

117
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,600
I am not 7.

118
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,870
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,390
My father was bipolar.

120
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,140
One night, when I was 10,

121
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,520
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

122
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,840
Yo!

123
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,600
What the hell is wrong with y'all?

124
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
This is not what we do here, gentlemen.

125
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,060
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

126
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,480
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

127
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,610
Apologies, Mr Milk. No, sir.

128
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,450
Nah, me neither, Mr Milk.

129
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,830
Which means that you have cut in line
in front of everybody else in here.

130
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,700
What else does it mean? Spit it out.

131
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,580
That we're disrespecting
the other niggas...

132
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,830
Excuse me?

133
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,170
All our fellow brothers in the unit.

134
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,130
You know how to write in the
English language in a passable fashion.

135
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,760
I know that because I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

136
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,360
Yes, sir.

137
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,510
Then place your John
Hancocks on my board.

138
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,510
Yes, sir, Mr Milk. Thank you.

139
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,430
At the bottom of the list.

140
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,810
Hell no.

141
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,440
What the fuck do you want?

142
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
What, I can't visit my old mate?

143
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,700
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

144
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,110
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

145
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,490
Bring it in.

146
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,620
If it's all the same,
let's cut the small talk.

147
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,290
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

148
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,210
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

149
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,420
Why are you here?

150
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,010
All right.

151
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,340
How'd you like to come back,
have another go?

152
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,890
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

153
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,770
I don't want to know nothing about nothing.

154
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm a happy man now. Life is good,

155
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,730
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Yeah? How is Monique?

156
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,360
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,190
I can't do that to her again, man.

158
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,610
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,280
Yeah, so I can see.

160
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,700
Don't make me come out there!

161
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,460
Well, this is God's work.

162
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,750
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

163
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,380
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

164
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,460
we were into some bad shit, man.

165
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,930
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

166
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,310
If I'm gonna make a difference,

167
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,140
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

168
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,390
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,900
Whereas you?

170
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,310
You're just a motherfucker.

171
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,820
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

172
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
because we just dusted a Supe.

173
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Bullshit.

174
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,710
Translucent.

175
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,880
What the...?

176
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,300
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

177
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,340
How the hell did you do it?

178
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,050
Well...

179
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,180
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

180
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,600
Boom, claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

181
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,440
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

182
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,480
Spilled the beans in a big way.

183
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,900
Now, we play this right,

184
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,280
we could shake up the whole hornets' nest,

185
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,410
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

186
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,990
You mean do Homelander?

187
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,830
This is about Becca, isn't it?

188
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,380
It's always about Becca with you.

189
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,380
You ain't got your reasons?

190
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,300
It'll be different this go, all right?

191
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,260
None of that "secrets and lies" bollocks.

192
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,100
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

193
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,730
I swear to God.

194
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,270
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

195
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,070
Because I can't work
with that motherfucker.

196
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,200
Frenchie? No, I ain't seen him in years.

197
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,950
M.M., you're the only bloke I can trust.

198
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,250
Since when have you ever trusted anybody?

199
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,500
Fuck.

200
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,460
Senator Calhoun, you've gone on the record

201
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,880
- against superheroes in the military.
- Who's a good boy?

202
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,420
- Why change your tune?
- No one's changing their tune.

203
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,090
It's just I realised that it's an
issue that affects all Americans.

204
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,010
- It shouldn't be decided by congressmen
- Can't you make it stop?

205
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,970
- Hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

206
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,940
- The bill needs to go to the floor.
- Okay.

207
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,770
No. We can't have that...

208
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,730
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

209
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,690
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

210
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,900
How?

211
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,320
He's got diamond skin.

212
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,530
He's gonna be fine.

213
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,240
My guys are on it.

214
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,040
All right, I forgot to
give you these. Here.

215
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,290
What is it?

216
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,160
Those are your new talking points.

217
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,580
Now that the military
bill is out of committee,

218
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,750
Corporate wants to sell the shit out of it.

219
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,670
Yes. They do.

220
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,930
Hey. You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

221
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,800
and I said, "No. No, no, no.

222
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,720
Make it the flag"? Remember that?

223
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,850
Yeah. I don't need these.

224
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,350
Okay?

225
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,650
I can sell my way into the military.

226
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,440
Thank you.

227
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,400
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

228
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,610
Mr Edgar wrote those personally.

229
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,950
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

230
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,870
be my guest.

231
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,330
Yes.
You're a happy boy now?

232
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,870
Are you a happy boy?

233
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,800
A rental, you cheap bastard?

234
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,100
Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

235
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,680
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

236
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,140
And you don't think this is conspicuous?

237
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,440
Conspicuous? No, I don't think it's
conspicuous. I think a big black van

238
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,570
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

239
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,440
This is just another truck on the street.

240
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,530
Bang on time.

241
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,130
Hi. Hughie.

242
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,840
Smelly motherfucker.

243
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,430
- Butcher, who is this guy?
- You'll give the game away!

244
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,720
- Not until this frog gets what's coming.
- Only thing that is coming

245
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,180
- is me on your mother's titties!
- Let me through at him!

246
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,640
We had an agreement about him.

247
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,100
We agreed to put a pin in it.

248
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,940
- What agreement?
- I don't trust this French whore.

249
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,690
I am more American than you,
you racist piece of shit!

250
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,150
- Why are they fighting?
- It is water under the bridge.

251
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,940
You tell that to Mallory's grandkids.

252
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,280
Tell them it's water under the bridge.

253
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,320
- That wasn't my fault.
- Who is Mallory?

254
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,740
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

255
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,380
Shit!

256
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,300
Hey, Monique.

257
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,810
How you doing, baby?

258
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,980
I forgot to marinade the tilapia.

259
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,980
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

260
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay, how about this?

261
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,110
How about, on my way home from work,

262
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,570
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

263
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,450
some portobello mushrooms,
that pinot that you love so much.

264
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,740
Yeah, baby.

265
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,200
Okay, I got to go.

266
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,450
All right, sweetheart.

267
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,080
Yeah. Me, too.

268
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,620
Baby, I just...

269
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,000
You're right, you're right.

270
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
I love you, too.

271
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay. Bye.

272
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,970
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

273
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,440
All right. All right.

274
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,650
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

275
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,480
We got a fucking job to do.

276
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,900
Fuck it. Dégage?

277
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,950
Get out of here.

278
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,490
- Who's this guy?
- The new lad. Hughie.

279
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,080
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

280
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,410
That's a... nickname?

281
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,870
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,210
- Did she?
- So we got

283
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,170
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

284
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,630
Great job, Butcher.

285
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,720
It was Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

286
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,680
She's home.

287
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,010
That's Popclaw, right?
A-Train's girlfriend?

288
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,270
Popclaw. Hi.

289
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,600
You know the rent?

290
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,980
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

291
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,190
- You think her and A-Train are...?
- Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

292
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,070
Didn't hear nothing about it.

293
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,660
According to Translucent,
A-Train knows this bird inside out.

294
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,240
- I'll drop the cheque off ASAP.
- Okay.

295
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,790
- Yeah.
- Okay.

296
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,500
All right. Let's get the bugs sorted,
see for ourselves.

297
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,180
Where'd you get this shit, Circuit City?

298
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,050
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

299
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,350
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

300
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,480
Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

301
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,150
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

302
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,780
They probably have one
in every room.

303
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,320
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,820
not in the toilet.
Look, I just need five minutes inside.

305
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,870
I mean, home service is my speciality.

306
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,290
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

307
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,090
We got the new router. I'm...

308
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,170
This is Hughie.

309
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm Gary.

310
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,760
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Well, your manager did.

311
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,510
He's upgrading
the whole building.

312
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,720
I just saw my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

313
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,720
I've got a work order right here, ma'am.

314
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,560
Only takes a second.

315
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,810
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

316
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,940
That's a lot.

317
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,770
Okay. Come on in.

318
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,410
The computer's right over here
if you need it.

319
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,040
Yeah. I just need to sign on to your server
in order to download the service package.

320
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,290
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

321
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,170
We're really big fans. I mean,

322
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,710
Terminal Beauty 3...

323
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,590
Damn.

324
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,550
Thanks.

325
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,930
Yeah, that one really came together.

326
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,470
Let me know if you guys need anything else.

327
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,100
Thank you.

328
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,570
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

329
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,580
Let's go.

330
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,590
What is it?

331
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,670
Nothing.

332
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,240
This kid is full of surprises.

333
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,990
Okay, ma'am, all done.

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you, guys.

335
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,920
Thank you.

336
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,750
Get your John Hancock?

337
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,500
- Sure.
- Thank you.

338
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,260
Excuse me, bud.

339
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,310
What, you want a autograph or something?

340
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,910
Haven't we met before?

341
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,000
Maybe.

342
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,540
I meet a ton of people.

343
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,500
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

344
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,960
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

345
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,880
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

346
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,010
You trying to get us killed?

347
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,510
Yeah.

348
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,340
I'll be right there.

349
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,300
Look, Translucent's probably just lurking

350
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,470
around a gynaecologist's office
or something.

351
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,270
For two days? Come on.

352
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,810
I don't get it. Why is no one concerned
about this?

353
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,310
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

354
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,940
they panic.

355
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,230
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

356
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,610
- Give them hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

357
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,860
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

358
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,110
then that's a direct attack on the Seven,

359
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,700
which is a direct attack on me.

360
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,660
You've managed to make this about you
in less than 20 seconds flat.

361
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,660
I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

362
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,120
So I think what you mean to say is,
"Thanks, Homelander,

363
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,290
for showing up out of the blue
and bringing the extra press to my collar."

364
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,750
Homelander. Maeve.

365
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,420
Captain, you guys are the real heroes.

366
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,340
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- Right.

367
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,550
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

368
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,720
All right. Sit tight.

369
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,190
Elevators?

370
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,940
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

371
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,650
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

372
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,910
Mr Edgar wants us both at the race

373
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,280
to roll out his new talking points.
You know this.

374
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,870
I've x-rayed Edgar, you know.

375
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,330
He is this close to a coronary.

376
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,370
He's got blood like engine oil.

377
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,170
And Stillwell, with that mewling baby...
It's ridiculous.

378
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,210
They're just people.

379
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,010
But they snap their fingers and we jump.

380
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,220
Why? Why do we do that?

381
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,890
Because they sign our cheques.

382
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,100
Can we just cut to the part
where you show up to the race anyway?

383
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,560
See, that's why I love you.

384
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,690
You're the only one who tells me the truth.

385
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,750
It's all over.

386
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,720
It's all over now.

387
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
There you go.

388
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,980
Goddamn it.

389
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,530
That was my collar.

390
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,620
It still is.

391
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,040
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

392
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,290
No, that's true.

393
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,210
I got excited. I'm sorry.

394
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,090
I'm sure you are.

395
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,340
You know the drill.

396
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,630
He shot at us first.

397
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,130
Attagirl.

398
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,110
- The things I let you do to me.
- Yeah.

399
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,650
We're not even dating anymore.

400
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,530
Fuck.

401
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,090
Want me to do the thing?

402
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,550
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

403
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,550
Okay.

404
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,810
That's a good boy.

405
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,280
Stop. Stop, stop.

406
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,700
Tickles. Tickling.

407
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,660
What's the problem?

408
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,750
Shockwave's the problem.

409
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,210
What if I lose?

410
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,580
You're not gonna lose.

411
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,000
- You're the fastest man alive.
- Until I'm not.

412
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,050
You know what Stillwell told me?

413
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,470
If I don't win, I'm out.

414
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,720
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in the Seven.

415
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,600
Babe.

416
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,150
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

417
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,950
You sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

418
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,360
amps you up something fierce.

419
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,780
Remember last time?

420
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,700
Last time's not gonna happen again.

421
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm under control.

422
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,620
You ran through a girl, baby.

423
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,880
That's not what I would call "control."

424
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,300
That shit's a slippery slope.

425
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,460
Take it from me.

426
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,470
No, I... I need it.

427
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,340
Honey, I'll still love
you even if you lose.

428
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,970
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

429
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,680
I have to win this thing.

430
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,100
I don't want to be
some washed-up B-squader.

431
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,480
Like me?

432
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,070
No, not like... That's...

433
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,070
I got to go.

434
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,790
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

435
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,960
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

436
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,710
What are you talking about?

437
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,170
I've been meaning to tell you.

438
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,460
Are you kidding me?

439
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,760
I have been getting my hair done,
threading my eyebrows,

440
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

441
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,140
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

442
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,390
in front of the world as a couple.

443
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,900
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

444
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
You did clear it with Stillwell.

445
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,150
Look, our time is gonna come, I promise,

446
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,910
but I got to get my leverage back first.

447
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,120
Where's the V?

448
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,000
- What the hell is Compound V?
- Sounds like

449
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,340
some kind of performance enhancer.

450
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,800
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

451
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,930
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

452
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,280
What are you grinning at?

453
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,200
I don't know, mate.

454
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,700
Maybe it's because the
Seven might just be a squad

455
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,250
of manky 'roid heads.

456
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,710
Now, this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

457
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,250
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

458
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,880
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

459
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,170
If we get a bit, can you work it out?

460
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,720
I can run some tests, of course.

461
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,130
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

462
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,590
Amazing idea.

463
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,140
We'll cross that bridge when we burn it.

464
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,970
First of all...

465
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,100
we got to get some.

466
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,090
Here's your cover.

467
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,630
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

468
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,260
So...

469
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,470
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

470
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,270
Yeah.

471
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,230
Yeah, that sounds right.

472
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,480
I don't know. I've kind
of lost track of time.

473
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,020
Talk about a baptism of fire.

474
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,770
I'll mic you up here.

475
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,400
So, Translucent?

476
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,870
How the fuck did you pull that off?

477
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,910
I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

478
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,580
Still. Must have been scary.

479
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,290
You want to know
what's really messed up?

480
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,090
Is...

481
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,550
in some ways...

482
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,800
just right in that moment, it...

483
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,100
felt kind of good.

484
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,600
It's written all over your face, Hughie.

485
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,810
What? How can you tell?

486
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,310
Because I know
how this job makes me feel.

487
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,070
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

488
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,030
I felt, like, a rush.

489
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,030
I get it.

490
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,990
- Like I felt alive.
- But that rush, Hughie,

491
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,080
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

492
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,790
Everything comes with a price.

493
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,710
The last thing I ever said to Robin...

494
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,640
was "Don't you ever besmirch Billy Joel."

495
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,640
That was the last thing that she heard
before she burst into pieces.

496
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,150
And I got to live with that shit
for the rest of my life.

497
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,530
The price?

498
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,120
Whatever it is...

499
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,950
I'll pay it.

500
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,840
This is the Race of the Century.

501
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,260
This is our legacy and our future.

502
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,310
Athletes achieving at the highest level.

503
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,150
This is what we've waited for,
the showdown.

504
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,360
These men are extremely powerful
and very, very quick.

505
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
The Train is ready to leave the station.

506
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,900
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

507
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,320
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

508
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,530
Who will come out on top?
There he stands,

509
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,240
6-foot-1, but a stature that's such

510
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,160
that he's a colossus for the whole world...

511
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,470
All right, champ.

512
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,930
You got this?

513
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,930
- Yeah.
- Hey...

514
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,770
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

515
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,690
Putting that wind at your back.

516
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,570
Now, you got this?

517
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,240
- I got this. I got this. Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about!

518
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,410
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right.

519
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,540
Introducing the newest member of the Seven:

520
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,920
Starlight, accompanied by Black Noir.

521
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,590
I'm tired of the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

522
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,180
If the people want us in the armed forces,

523
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,600
the people can order Congress to do it.

524
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,350
- Am I right? Yes!
- Yeah!

525
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,950
Sorry I'm late.
You got room for one more?

526
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,530
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

527
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,450
Hey, who's ready to see a race?

528
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,620
Let's hear it for my boy A-Train.

529
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,540
All right.

530
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,880
You fucking cocksuckers.

531
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,010
Please remain standing for the singing
of our national anthem.

532
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,930
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

533
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,020
Aren't you cute?

534
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,690
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

535
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,520
Of course, honey. Take this.

536
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Look at you!

537
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,820
You really dress the part.

538
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,530
It's your old uniform,
but I'm saving up for the new one.

539
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,460
Hey, Starlight!

540
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,080
Show us your tits!

541
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,420
Come on!

542
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,420
- Come on!
- Baby!

543
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,630
- Damn, baby, you look fine AF!
- Lean down a little bit more!

544
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,220
Hey, hey, hey.

545
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,300
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

546
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,510
Kick my ass, Starlight!

547
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,730
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

548
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,060
I like that one much better.

549
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,030
- Starlight?
- I need a minute.

550
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,190
Where's she going?

551
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,870
Let's make some noise!

552
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,500
Glad you made it.

553
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,630
I had a feeling you might.

554
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,420
Remember when we used to just fly off
to Paris, like,

555
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,210
- on a whim?
- Yeah, I remember

556
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
freezing my ass off across the Atlantic.

557
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,930
Yeah, those were good times.

558
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,140
Why did we ever break up?

559
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,600
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

560
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,730
Come on.

561
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,690
You know...

562
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,030
Yeah, kiss her!

563
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,610
If I ever really thought

564
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,160
that you'd fallen for someone else...

565
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,490
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

566
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,830
- Is that so?
- Yeah, you and me?

567
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,580
We're different.

568
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,710
We're better.

569
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,290
- Together forever.
- Okay, well...

570
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,260
Here comes the A-Train.

571
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,100
All aboard!

572
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,560
The Train is ready to leave the station.

573
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,970
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

574
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,930
Starlight! Starlight!

575
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,270
- Starlight!
- Starlight, over here!

576
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,150
Annie?

577
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,320
I love your new outfit!

578
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,320
Annie? Annie!

579
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,860
Annie? Hi!

580
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,530
Hughie?

581
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,620
From the bench the other day?

582
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,240
You're... You're Starlight.

583
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,540
That's... How did I not realise that?

584
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,870
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

585
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,370
Fucking hell, Hughie.

586
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,080
You know Starlight?

587
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,170
Well, Hughie, it was...

588
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,510
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

589
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,590
- No, Hughie, we need more time.
- Can I...

590
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,930
buy you an overpriced beer?

591
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,760
You know, if you've... If you got time.

592
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,770
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

593
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,610
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

594
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,580
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

595
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,000
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

596
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,160
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day...

597
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,040
Was it three days ago?

598
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,130
You just seemed like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

599
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,460
- And now it's just...
- Now I'm a freak.

600
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,260
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

601
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,010
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

602
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,060
but... not that you don't have that...

603
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
- I'm messing with you.
- Okay.

604
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,480
Bad news.

605
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,280
- No V.
- Great. We're fucked.

606
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,860
No, it...

607
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,780
It was really nice to talk to someone
who didn't know who I was.

608
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,040
Once you're behind the scenes, it's...

609
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,960
- It's different.
- Like how?

610
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

611
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,420
I think they just want you
to look like one.

612
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,270
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

613
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,400
about how much you hated your job,
you meant...?

614
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,020
You meant this job?

615
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,360
Then...

616
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,320
just quit.

617
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,290
Just walk away.
I mean, you got nothing to prove.

618
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,920
I should probably get back,

619
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,710
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

620
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,760
- Yeah, totally.
- So...

621
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,220
Listen, Annie... Starlight.

622
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,850
- What do you...?
- Annie.

623
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,220
This is insane, but...

624
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,600
I know you're you and everything,
but if you ever just wanted to...

625
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,770
you know, get...

626
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,860
Would you like my number?

627
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,950
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

628
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,860
That's what I was asking.

629
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,320
- Okay.
- Do I call you,

630
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,080
- or do I just commit a crime?
- Probably committing a crime

631
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
would get me to you quicker, so...

632
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,460
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

633
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
here comes Shockwave.

634
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,310
You all right?

635
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

636
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,270
I'm fast, baby. Like, how I roll, you know?

637
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,280
You look wired as hell.

638
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,320
Well, it's just Mom's... Her spirit

639
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,610
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

640
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,240
I've got eyes on A-Train.

641
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,620
He's totally jacked.

642
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,160
He must've shot up the V.

643
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,750
We missed it, boys.

644
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm out of here. I'll check in later.

645
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,230
Where the hell you going?

646
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,110
Just gonna see about a girl.

647
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn your attention to the track.

648
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,850
Please, clear the track.

649
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,610
Set.

650
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,210
Yes!

651
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,960
He's done it again! A-Train wins!

652
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,920
A new world record for A-Train.
They say lightning doesn't strike twice.

653
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,850
The world belongs to A-Train.

654
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,470
A-Train wins.

655
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,930
A-Train wins!

656
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,390
Stunning! Absolutely stunning.

657
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,990
So, how the hell do you know Starlight?

658
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,280
I don't really "know her" know her. Just...

659
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,990
We met on a park bench.

660
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,580
You get her number?

661
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,670
Yeah.

662
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,300
Hughie?

663
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,340
Yeah. Got it.

664
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,760
Good.

665
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,970
M.M.

666
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,140
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

667
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,400
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

668
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,150
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Get over here now.

669
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,940
Well, you know what? Shockwave ran

670
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,860
a good, clean race, but there can only be
one fastest man in the world,

671
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,660
and that's the A-Train, baby!

672
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,240
- Yes, baby.
- A-Train,

673
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,040
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

674
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,460
Well, you know me.

675
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,130
I'm always in the game,
but I'm too fast to catch.

676
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,460
I'm open to offers, though, ladies.

677
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,920
There's plenty to go around.

678
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,970
A-Train, how have you managed
to stay on top all this time?

679
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,210
Fucking hell.

680
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,960
You said it.

681
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,380
She's been at it for an hour.

682
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,630
Come and get me!

683
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,050
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

684
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,550
Okay.

685
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,380
You see that red case over there?

686
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,180
I've been around long enough to know
a fix kit when I see one.

687
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,770
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

688
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,730
So she's got experience.

689
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,770
I figured if you wait around long enough,
two plus two equals nasty.

690
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,270
Sherlock fucking Homie.

691
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,900
Now admit it.

692
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,150
This beats babysitting delinquents any day,
don't it?

693
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,990
Fuck...

694
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,100
- Hey, Popclaw.
- Mr Lutz.

695
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,600
- House call?
- I'm just here for the rent.

696
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,190
The rent you said you would pay?

697
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,480
You should come in.

698
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,190
You can wait there if you want,

699
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,650
but it's gonna take me a few minutes
to write the cheque.

700
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,150
I don't bite.

701
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,990
Unless you want me to.

702
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,030
That was a joke, Alek.

703
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,450
Alek, right?

704
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,160
Okay, let's get that cheque.

705
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,750
You want a drink, Alek,
while you wait?

706
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,120
- You prefer Alek or Alexander?
- Alek.

707
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,960
It's actually short for Aleksy.

708
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
I like that.

709
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,460
Sounds more exotic.

710
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,260
Okay.

711
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,270
Like what you see?

712
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,270
No. Yes.

713
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,520
I mean, it's... lovely.

714
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,150
It's okay.

715
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,190
A lot of guys have a superhero fantasy.

716
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,610
I'm sorry? I mean, I...

717
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,830
You know...

718
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,920
there is a world
where we could come...

719
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,630
to an understanding.

720
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,520
Stop! In the name of the law.

721
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,930
No. Popclaw has caught me.

722
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:26,360
I am gonna sit right here

723
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,110
until the cops come.

724
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,030
You're not a cat burglar.

725
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:33,030
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

726
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,330
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

727
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Say it!

728
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,460
I'm a filthy pig who likes to eat ass.

729
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,750
Who likes to eat ass?

730
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,640
- He can't breathe.
- No, no, wait.

731
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,260
Hold on. Hang it back. Not so fast.

732
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,630
My...

733
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,800
You let that guy die.

734
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,680
And he didn't do anything wrong.

735
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,430
He was dead already.

736
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,810
That's bullshit.

737
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,230
So you can cross a street,

738
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,520
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

739
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,270
like some Supe, can you?

740
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,980
And even if you had have got there,

741
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,360
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

742
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:56,110
Now we got her
right where we want her.

743
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,200
What? What are you talking about?

744
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,790
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

745
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,620
to the one weakness they all got.

746
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,420
Their reputations.

747
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,590
Come on, Frenchie.

748
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,640
Like you said.

749
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,020
Whatever the price, you'll pay it.

750
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,100
Right?

751
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,490
Easy. Easy.

752
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,820
We ain't here to hurt you.

753
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,620
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

754
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,090
And all you got to do

755
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:54,710
is tell us everything you know
about this.

756
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,970
Who are you?

757
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,850
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

758
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,730
No, no, not fire. Water.

759
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,440
Just ask my little guppy here.

760
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,980
You can show her.

761
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,200
Well, a very good friend of mine

762
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,410
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

763
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,620
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom of the harbour.

764
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,710
Go ahead, don't be shy.

765
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,640
Jesus Christ.

766
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,300
Is that Translucent?

767
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,890
Still think we got nothing to worry about?

768
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,730
How did they even get through his skin?

769
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,890
What kind of a maniac...?

770
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,270
Not maniac.

771
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,110
Smart, actually.

772
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,990
Very smart.

773
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,990
Hey, Deep, what can't I see through?

774
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,780
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

775
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,910
And what's the box made of, Deep?

776
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,710
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

777
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,630
They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

778
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,760
What's left of him... eventually.

779
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,510
So they were just buying time.

780
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,890
Why do you say that?

781
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,510
I'm so glad you asked.

782
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,860
Whoever it was...

783
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,490
they just declared war.

784
