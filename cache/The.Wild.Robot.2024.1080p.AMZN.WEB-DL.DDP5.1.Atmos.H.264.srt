00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,330
Hello. Bonjour.

2
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,958
Guten Tag. Hujambo. Hola.

3
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,918
Congratulations on your purchase

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,254
of a Universal Dynamics robot.

5
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,257
I am Rozzum 7134.

6
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,093
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

7
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,678
Just ask.

8
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,475
Just ask.

9
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,781
Processing.

10
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,654
Do you need...

11
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
assistance?

12
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,590
Ready to receive my first task.

13
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,372
Rozzum 7134 is available
for task assignment.

14
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,876
Rozzum robots come standard
with the Alpha-113

15
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,878
dimensional processor.

16
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,714
If you're unsure
about how I can assist,

17
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,425
try asking me about myself.

18
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,393
Excuse me.

19
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,312
Did you know I can assist
with grocery shopping?

20
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,855
Banking?

21
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,317
Landscaping?

22
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,368
Hello. Did you perhaps order
a Rozzum helper robot?

23
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,412
Is that a no?

24
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,997
Here's a free sticker.

25
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,292
Scan the code and receive
ten percent off of your...

26
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,433
Do you need assistance?

27
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,852
I see your problem.

28
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,870
Rozzums are programmed
for instant physical mimicry,

29
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,496
so as to...

30
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,858
Aggression detected.

31
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,444
My communication package
includes

32
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,572
strategies
for conflict resolution.

33
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,411
Your dialect is not
in my data banks.

34
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,164
Tell your people not to worry.

35
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,127
Rozzum 7134 will sort out this
language barrier in no time.

36
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,635
Activating learning mode.

37
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,657
-I say...
-Hey, check it out.

38
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,700
Look, look, look.
Somebody died over here.

39
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,452
Let me see. Let me see. Oh!

40
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,703
-Who was it?
-Anybody we know?

41
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,414
Fresh or not fresh?

42
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,623
Smells pretty good.

43
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,041
Tastes terrible!

44
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,543
-Oh, it's waking up.
-Hey, it's waking up.

45
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,089
-It's a monster!
-Run for your lives!

46
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,883
Look, that's the thing
that destroyed my dam.

47
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
-The monster.
-Yikes!

48
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,595
I think it's gonna talk.

49
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,389
Thank you for your patience

50
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,975
while I deciphered
your language.

51
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:18,229
I am Rozzum 7134,
ready to enhance your lives

52
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,899
with integrated multiphase
task accomplishment.

53
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,905
Are you here to kill us?

54
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,575
Negative. I am here to help
with whatever task you...

55
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,326
It says no!

56
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,873
It's dead.

57
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,250
Ah, thank goodness.

58
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,760
-The monster!
-The monster!

59
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,681
The monster!

60
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,476
Did anyone order me?

61
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,876
Anyone?

62
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,088
Delivery unsuccessful.

63
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,300
Return to factory.

64
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,470
Activating return transmitter.

65
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,098
Three, two, one.

66
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Ow!

67
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,708
Activating return transmitter.

68
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,084
Three.

69
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,045
-Pretty.
-Get it!

70
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,339
Two.

71
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,176
One.

72
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,344
Ha!

73
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,235
Wait. Stop! No!

74
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,821
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

75
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,996
Again!

76
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,283
May I confirm that is yours?

77
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,131
Hmm?

78
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,469
Here you go. Take it.

79
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,273
Ow.

80
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,466
Huh.

81
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,388
Ow.

82
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,293
Was this task accomplished
to your satisfaction?

83
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,339
On a scale of one to ten,

84
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,300
where ten is most satisfied
and one is least,

85
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,427
how would you rate
my performance?

86
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,639
I will register that as a ten.

87
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,141
Returning to factory.

88
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,229
Signal strength weak.

89
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,856
Seeking higher ground.

90
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,166
Do you require shelter?

91
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,597
Perhaps tips for planning
your next vacation?

92
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,986
I do not understand
this response.

93
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,197
Signal acquired.

94
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,284
Three, two, one.

95
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,503
Mom, I don't feel good.

96
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,173
If I barf,
I'm taking you all with me.

97
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,176
Mom told you not to eat
grasshoppers, dummy.

98
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,428
Petunia's been in front all day.

99
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,680
The prettiest opossum
always rides in front.

100
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,349
Try being pretty with my tail
jammed in your eye.

101
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,186
Bartlett!

102
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,605
Stop jamming your tail
in your sister's eye.

103
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,731
I'm Rowan.

104
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,191
Bartlett was last litter.

105
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,859
Are you sure?

106
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,070
Who are all of you? Go away.

107
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,988
We're your children.

108
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,115
Except for him.

109
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,409
Well, this is what I get
for taking a walk.

110
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,703
Where's your mommy, little guy?

111
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,246
The monster!

112
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,710
You got to die faster.

113
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,629
Meningitis takes a while.

114
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,047
-What did you pick?
-Rabies.

115
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,507
Spontaneous combustion.

116
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,300
-Nightshade salad.
-Sepsis.

117
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,302
Hey! I picked sepsis!

118
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,221
None of you are doing it right.

119
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,680
We talked about this.

120
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,391
Dead things don't have to
explain why they're dead.

121
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,893
Now we're gonna get killed
for real.

122
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
Sorry, Mom.

123
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,854
Sorry.

124
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
Uh, why aren't we killed yet?

125
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
Good question.

126
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,033
Nice knowing you, Mom.

127
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,159
All right. It's okay.

128
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,619
It's okay.

129
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,955
Uh, hey.

130
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,207
You in there? I'm Pinktail.

131
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,375
Oh, okay.

132
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,043
-Wow.
-Hello.

133
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,087
Uh, this gosling is yours?

134
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,421
Negative.

135
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,549
That gosling stalks me,
emits noise

136
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,011
and makes simple tasks
more complicated or impossible.

137
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,429
Yeah, they do that.

138
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,932
Goslings imprint
on the first thing they see.

139
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,267
Which would be you.

140
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,726
Congratulations.

141
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,521
As far as he's concerned,
you're his mother now.

142
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,607
I do not have the programming
to be a mother.

143
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,984
No one does.

144
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
We just make it up.

145
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,196
Without an assigned task,
my next priority

146
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,198
is to return to factory.

147
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,952
Taking care of him
is your task now.

148
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,290
Task acquired.
Return mode delayed.

149
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,084
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

150
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,586
You're lucky you just have one.

151
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,129
As a mother of seven...

152
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,758
...six babies,
it's a full-time thing.

153
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
But it's not all bad.

154
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,639
Just mostly bad.

155
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,268
Do you have any information on
how to take care of this unit?

156
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,270
They all need to eat.

157
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,148
But yours needs to swim and fly.

158
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,108
Oh, fly by fall.

159
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,819
He's got to leave this island
before winter or...

160
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,030
Uh, how do I put this
delicately?

161
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,074
Yeah. That.

162
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,411
Eat, swim, fly by fall or...

163
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,830
Patience is the key.

164
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,833
It's okay, Mom. I'm alive.

165
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,043
Oh.

166
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,669
Yay.

167
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,172
-Well, good luck.
-Goodbye.

168
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,174
We like your new baby.

169
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,968
Hope it doesn't die.

170
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,392
Eat, swim, fly by fall.

171
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,567
Eat.

172
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,986
Huh?

173
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,448
Swim.

174
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,410
Whoa!

175
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,706
I say, keep your trash out of
my pond.

176
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,874
That's littering.

177
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,627
Not to mention murder.

178
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,755
Huh?

179
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,050
Fly.

180
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,604
Allow me to introduce myself.

181
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,774
Fink-- predator
and local goose expert.

182
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,568
Which I know you could use
about now.

183
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,195
You are the destroyer unit.

184
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,614
It's okay. I won't eat him.

185
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,324
Are you crazy? I might eat him.

186
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,659
You said you would not.

187
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,745
Do you believe
everything you hear?

188
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,913
Yes.

189
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,499
Noted.

190
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,293
Why did you steal my gosling?

191
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm a fox. I do foxy things.

192
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,088
It's in my nature.

193
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,090
Your programming.

194
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,550
Why'd you help me?

195
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,969
I'm a robot.
I do robot-y things.

196
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,264
I seek tasks
and ensure all essential needs

197
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,932
have been met or exceeded.

198
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,066
I have some essential needs.

199
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,109
FINK and GOSLING:
Aw.

200
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,361
Fink, as a local goose expert,

201
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,656
how do I get-- mmm--
to eat, swim, fly?

202
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,951
I thought you'd never ask.

203
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
Let's start with eat.

204
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,497
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there.

205
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,626
Hmm.

206
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,756
Ow.

207
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,049
I do not think
these are suitable.

208
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,258
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

209
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,135
Let me check.

210
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,970
Mmm. Seems good to me.

211
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,557
Say, can you make yourself
look like a bear?

212
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,603
I'm here for a honey lunch.

213
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,606
I believe I am under attack.

214
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,483
-You're doing great.
-Should I be concerned?

215
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,360
Sorry, can't hear you.

216
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,323
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Here you go, kid.

217
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,538
Huh?

218
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,086
How do goslings
normally do this?

219
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,798
Ooh.

220
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,050
Mmm, mmm.

221
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,052
This is not working.

222
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,261
Are you kidding?

223
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,305
Everything is working great.

224
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,225
Oh, yeah, that.

225
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,476
Here.

226
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,520
Yum.

227
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,147
Phase one of task is completed.

228
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,691
Now, we're gonna have to do
all this over tomorrow.

229
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,152
All these kids do...

230
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,946
is eat.

231
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,697
I understand.

232
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,991
-What's that?
-My power core.

233
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,410
It is damaged.

234
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,621
Without it, I rely on my
solar surfaces and batteries.

235
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,915
Yeah, you should work on that.

236
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,250
Mmm.

237
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,128
I also need
a replacement transmitter.

238
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,213
Ugh, do I have to do everything?

239
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,133
When we run across
another robot, we'll kill it

240
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,176
-and take its transmitter.
-Negative.

241
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,637
-Huh?
-Rozzum inhibition protocols

242
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,514
prevent deliberate harm
to others.

243
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,852
Look, you need to learn
how things work on this island.

244
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,729
Me, the bear, everybody,

245
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,857
we're all just trying
to survive.

246
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,735
And kindness is not
a survival skill.

247
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,820
Mmm.

248
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,071
Yeah, so, uh,

249
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,739
how did you get
a gosling anyway?

250
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,241
There was an accident.

251
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,742
I terminated his family.

252
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,202
For future reference,

253
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,079
you probably want to keep
all that to yourself.

254
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,374
Understood.
Do not mention dead family.

255
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,628
Fink, how long do you estimate
swim and fly to take?

256
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,046
Swimming's easy.

257
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,507
I can teach him
the way my mom taught me.

258
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,593
Swim!

259
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
-Fink.
-Hmm?

260
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,763
He will not learn that way.

261
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,099
Not if you keep doing that.

262
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,936
Just between us,
this whole thing

263
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,813
might not take as long
as you think.

264
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,149
Your gosling,
he isn't exactly...

265
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,609
...normal.

266
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,777
I have a defective baby?

267
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,779
He's what they call a runt.

268
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,198
A runt.

269
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,116
Fact is,
even if his whole family

270
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,326
hadn't have been killed,

271
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,411
he probably wouldn't
have lived very long.

272
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,913
-Just, I don't know...
-Whoa!

273
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,664
...don't get too attached
to the little guy.

274
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,124
That's all.

275
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,793
If you want,
I could eat him right now

276
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,879
-and save you the grief later.
-Negative.

277
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,633
Eating this task is not
the same as completing it.

278
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,427
Ugh. So we're doing this.

279
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,889
Well, if you don't want me
or anyone else to eat him,

280
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,392
you're gonna need a place
that's safer than out here!

281
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,145
Which is a great idea!

282
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
New project.

283
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,317
Is it normal to burp this much?

284
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,653
Ooh.

285
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,787
That thing's gonna fall on you.

286
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,497
And squish you to jelly.

287
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,915
This guy's nuts.

288
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,625
-Who is that?
-Paddler?

289
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,043
Local laughingstock.

290
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,462
Spends every day
trying to cut down

291
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,506
the biggest tree on the island.

292
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,174
He's obsessed.

293
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,760
Kind of like you
and your task hang-up.

294
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,762
His programming.

295
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,390
Hey, Paddler, you're never
gonna finish that!

296
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,517
Felling this is not the point.

297
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,061
The process is the art.

298
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,813
And that's what happens
to your brain

299
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,440
when you eat wood, weirdo.

300
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,858
Yeah?

301
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,860
Well, you'll eat
those words, vermin.

302
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,362
Are you sure

303
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,864
Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?

304
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,033
He doesn't need to know.

305
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,538
Mmm.

306
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,457
Hmm? Huh?

307
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,959
Seriously?

308
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,129
He needs room for me
and my stuff.

309
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,880
Better.

310
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,049
Now, you can make one
this big, right?

311
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,762
No task is
impossible for Rozzum 7134.

312
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,472
Roz...

313
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,808
7... 34?

314
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,228
But you can call me Roz.

315
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,813
Roz!

316
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,398
Roz, Roz, Roz, Roz...

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,568
Where are you from that things
don't eat each other?

318
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,069
I do not know my origin point.

319
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,779
Well, who made you?

320
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,906
Someone made me?

321
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,950
Someone made me?

322
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,998
Humor is based on misfortune?

323
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,083
-Misfortune.
-Yeah.

324
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,084
Here.

325
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,586
-Try it.
-Yeah.

326
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,381
-Not funny.
-Not funny.

327
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,927
Ugh. Squirrels.

328
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,434
Your inefficient participation

329
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,894
will slow the process.

330
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,812
Slow the process.

331
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,689
I'll just be over here.

332
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,776
Little sad but otherwise okay.

333
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,402
Just this once.

334
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,547
Perfect.

335
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,924
Home?

336
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,801
Meh. A little rustic.

337
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,762
I think I know what is missing.

338
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,018
So, what are you
gonna name him?

339
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,189
-I assign to you Gosling 0001.
-Huh?

340
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,400
-Okay, that sucked.
-That sucked.

341
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,737
Whoa.

342
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,156
You got to learn
to make stuff up.

343
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,911
-Come on. Find that...
-inside you.

344
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,329
Searching.

345
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,751
-Anything yet?
-No.

346
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,004
Just have a little fun for once.

347
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,342
Gosling 0186. There.

348
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,885
You see what I did?

349
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,346
His numbering is
out of sequence.

350
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,354
His name can't have numbers.

351
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,523
It's like someone
didn't even like him.

352
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,608
My name has numbers.

353
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,235
It's got to be personal.

354
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
Personal.

355
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,447
Processing "personal."

356
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,700
Bright. Bill.

357
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,118
Brightbill.

358
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,745
Is that satisfactory?

359
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,955
Brightbill? Processing.

360
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,707
Beep, beep, boop, boop.

361
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,543
-Satisfactory.
-Oh, yeah.

362
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,920
That's perfect. Oh.

363
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,506
Oh. Oh.

364
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,716
That's nice.

365
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,802
Comfortable, are we?

366
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
This house of yours?

367
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,015
You copied it. It's my design.

368
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,560
I know it was you,
and I know where you live.

369
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,566
Oh, perfect. Now no one's
gonna get any sleep.

370
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,027
How do we reset Brightbill?

371
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,238
When I was little,
my mom would rock me to sleep.

372
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,615
Like this!

373
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,074
That will damage him.

374
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,452
Hey. I turned out just fine.

375
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,746
You could tell him a story,

376
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,998
but that's a lot more work.

377
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,751
How will fictional narrative
help Brightbill?

378
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,922
Kids need to feel safe
and loved and all that junk.

379
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,757
A story can do that?

380
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,761
Storytelling is lying-adjacent,
and I lie for a living.

381
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,096
Watch and learn.

382
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,182
Just fill in the blanks.

383
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:14,020
Let me see here. Once,
there was, uh, this island

384
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,980
with a little gosling.

385
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,148
Brightbill?

386
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,609
And he was all alone.

387
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,278
Because the rest
of his family was destroyed.

388
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,655
Not yet.

389
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
And what this
little gosling needed

390
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,618
-was a mother.
-Ooh.

391
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,829
So he looked up at the stars

392
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
and asked the brightest one

393
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,333
if it could send him
one of their extras.

394
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,795
Funny thing is
there's this beautiful robot

395
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,215
that happened to be sitting
on the edge of that star.

396
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,842
And she hears him.

397
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,802
-Okay, now.
-Which is impossible

398
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,013
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.

399
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,975
Ugh. But she still heard him

400
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,395
because she was listening with
a different part of herself.

401
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,566
A part that, up to that point,
she didn't even know she had.

402
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,942
Her heart.

403
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,903
How did my mama come to me
from so far away?

404
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,905
-Who cares?
-Huh?

405
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,825
Uh, I mean,
she's trying to see you.

406
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,577
-Me?
-And falls off that star

407
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,414
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.

408
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,959
But she lands pretty hard,
and a lot of stuff she knew

409
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,253
-just kind of fell out.
-Oh, no!

410
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,546
So it's a little weird

411
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,172
what she knows
and what she doesn't.

412
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
But she remembers
one thing: you.

413
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,637
And when she finally sees you,

414
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,181
-she feels...
-Crushing obligation.

415
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,642
Very lucky to be a mother.

416
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,810
Mama.

417
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
And I will not leave

418
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,479
until I have completed
this task,

419
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,690
which has delayed me,
damaged me

420
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,233
and violated my protocols,

421
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,694
potentially voiding my warranty.

422
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,071
Which is robot for:

423
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,782
She loves you very much.

424
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,787
The story worked.

425
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,582
I need a drink.

426
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,212
How do you tell a story

427
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,924
about something
you say you know nothing about?

428
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,009
You'll need to be more specific.

429
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,761
Love.

430
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,639
Yeah, well, when you grow up
without something,

431
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,100
you spend a lot of time
thinking about it.

432
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:24,233
To conserve battery power,
I must shut down until morning.

433
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,089
I miss her
when she sleeps, too.

434
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,107
Scanning.
Beep, bop, boop, boop.

435
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
Possible animal friend sighted.

436
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,278
Activating interspecies
outreach protocol.

437
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,533
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

438
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,785
I am Gosling 0186,

439
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,162
but you can call me Bright...

440
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,956
I expected to have

441
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,291
at least one friend by summer,
but they all just...

442
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,168
-Scream and run?
-Yes.

443
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,838
I have experienced
the same phenomenon.

444
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,172
-Fink?
-Beats me.

445
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,717
Nothing weird about you two.

446
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,635
Thank you.

447
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,847
Show me deer.

448
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,348
Uh, bear.

449
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,308
Porcupine. Squirrel.

450
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,269
Uh, turtle opossum.
Otter moose.

451
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,645
Now skunk.

452
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,814
I do not want to do skunk.

453
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,649
Skunk.

454
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,569
Skunky, skunky, skunky.

455
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,946
Boo!

456
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,573
How do you do that?

457
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,159
I overheat
my Fallium transducer coils,

458
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,619
then leak a little
hydraulic fluid on them.

459
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,496
Does overheating
the transducers

460
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,123
have any draining effect on
the secondary cooling modules?

461
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,333
Not if I precool
the load sensors.

462
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,754
BRIGHTBILL and ROZ: Exemplary
day for swimming tests.

463
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,465
Pinktail, appetizers.

464
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,842
They were bored
and wanted to see stuff sink.

465
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,218
Death's proximity...

466
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,179
Makes life burn
all the brighter.

467
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,889
-It's true.
-Yeah.

468
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,183
Primary motor appendages in
opposing stroke start position.

469
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,350
Come on, guys. It's happening.

470
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,478
-Yeah! Hurry!
-Let's go see!

471
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,688
-Is he gonna drown?
-Or get the hypothermias?

472
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,942
No. The impact alone
will probably kill him.

473
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,694
-Yeah!
-Yay!

474
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,280
Uh, you know,
suddenly I'm thinking

475
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,532
I should maybe just stay
with you guys this winter.

476
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,700
Nope.

477
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,956
Is he dead yet?

478
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,835
Hey. It-it's working.

479
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,378
I-I think I got it.

480
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,172
Well done, Brightbill.

481
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,758
Swimming requirement fulfilled.

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,927
-That's drowning.
-No.

483
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,428
That's swimming.

484
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,679
Yeah.

485
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,473
Thanks, you guys.

486
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,226
Uh, perhaps
you could limit your range

487
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,644
to stay within view.

488
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,063
Roz, he needs
to become independent

489
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,439
if he's gonna migrate.

490
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,234
I prefer he be independent
closer to home.

491
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,944
He won't die.

492
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,446
Well, mmm, probably won't die.

493
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,450
It's unlikely he would die
just right now.

494
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,787
Are you dying?

495
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,248
Do everyone a favor
and expire downstream.

496
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,708
I'm good. Just swimming.

497
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:36,175
I think I need to find
an island that's less weird.

498
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,105
Whoa. They're me.

499
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,439
I'm them.

500
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,774
Here I come!

501
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,820
Hey!

502
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,537
-Hello.
-Whoa.

503
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,497
Bonjour. Konnichiwa. Hujambo.

504
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,957
Uh, uh, I'm Gosling...

505
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,003
Oh! Um, are you dying?

506
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,380
Why does everyone ask that?

507
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm swimming.

508
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,135
That's not how you do it.

509
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,470
It is. I studied the diagram.

510
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,723
-I can teach you if you want.
-Wait.

511
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,141
You, you're it.

512
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,894
You're that goose thing
raised by that monster.

513
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,478
Monster? Wait.

514
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,898
Goose "thing"?

515
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,362
You're a big subject
of curiosity around here.

516
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,365
You sound so normal.

517
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,576
My learning curves
are within expected parameters,

518
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,287
and I'm on target
to mature before fall.

519
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,497
Kind of normal.

520
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,166
Why are you over here?

521
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,210
Did that thing die?

522
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,295
Look what we have here.

523
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,672
No way. It lives.

524
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,466
And almost floats.

525
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,676
Greetings.

526
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,386
I see you, too,
have feathers and wings.

527
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,973
Perhaps we can share stories
of common interests.

528
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,683
We have nothing
in common with you.

529
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,019
The freak show is on
the other side of the lake.

530
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,187
You call that a wing?

531
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,397
Ow! That creates
a pain response.

532
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,358
Try swimming with your feet.

533
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,817
You don't belong here.

534
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,987
Come on. Fly away!

535
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,322
Roz!

536
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,241
Brightbill.

537
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,617
The monster!

538
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,035
It's here!

539
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,370
Eat the slow, weak ones!

540
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,412
Leave me alone!

541
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,923
-Brightbill?
-It's Rockmouth.

542
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,424
Get him out of there!

543
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,011
Roz?

544
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,936
Roz! Hurry!

545
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,314
Brightbill, focus on me.

546
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,442
Now swim as fast as you can.

547
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,364
Head down now!

548
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,207
Oh, no.

549
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,295
He's gonna eat me!

550
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,766
Why'd he attack me?

551
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,601
Because you are a runt.

552
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,271
He just wanted to make
contact with his own kind.

553
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,399
He is not our kind.

554
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,109
He is a 98% match to your...

555
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,278
No, I'm not.

556
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,946
Let's just go, Mom.

557
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,908
Wait. You think
that thing is your mother?

558
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,368
Yes.

559
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,787
No. I don't know.

560
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,789
That thing killed your mother.

561
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,083
Everyone knows that.

562
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,836
Oh, thanks for talking so much.

563
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,547
Now I know who to eat first!

564
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,466
Roz, remember
how things work here.

565
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,343
Stop it, Fink.
Please, let's go.

566
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,927
I hope this interaction...

567
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:07,845
Mom, stop.

568
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,306
Uh, I just intended to...

569
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,516
Roz!

570
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,983
I'll see you all for dinner!
This is not over!

571
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,003
How did I become... this?

572
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,880
The truth.

573
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,010
There was an accident.

574
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,595
Did you do it?

575
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,057
Yes.

576
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,600
It wasn't her fault, kid.

577
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,268
Why didn't you tell me?

578
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,730
I did not think the information
would assist you.

579
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,607
That's not
your decision to make.

580
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,860
I-I can't believe
how long I bought this.

581
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,196
I really thought
you were my family.

582
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,864
You... did?

583
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,534
It was so obvious.
I feel so stupid.

584
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,077
I miscalculated.

585
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,955
I should have considered
your e-emotional wavelengths.

586
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,623
You think?
So, was it just guilt?

587
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,250
Is that why you did this?

588
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,960
I... I-I needed a task.

589
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,878
Well, I'm glad
I could give you one.

590
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,881
The events that led to
this situation were unintended.

591
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,802
Tell that to my sisters,
my brothers, my real mom.

592
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,720
They were my chance
to be normal.

593
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,597
They were my chance to swim,
to fly.

594
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,307
What even am I?

595
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,394
You swam satisfactorily today,
and if you keep practicing...

596
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,230
I still won't belong.

597
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,523
I understand.

598
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,066
You don't understand anything.

599
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,027
You don't feel anything.

600
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,864
You're not my mom.

601
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,661
At Universal Dynamics,

602
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,746
design is our passion.

603
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,831
Our communities
circle the globe,

604
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,169
welcoming all people
who dream of a preplanned life

605
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,255
where every need
has been anticipated,

606
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,340
no detail overlooked.

607
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,010
Could this world get any better?

608
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
Here you go.

609
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,180
It has.

610
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,767
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robots.

611
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,770
These robots are designed
to fit seamlessly

612
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,983
into our communities,
even your homes.

613
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,443
One Rozzum robot
for every five humans

614
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:55,072
means a 40% increase
in leisure time and happiness.

615
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:59,243
Solar-powered,
l-l-loved by everyone, R-Roz...

616
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,161
is always in the sun.

617
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,288
Loved by everyone.

618
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,332
Part of
the Universal Dynamics family.

619
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,939
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

620
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,610
Congratulations on
your Universal Dynamics robot.

621
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,779
I am Rozzum 6262.

622
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,575
Your name cannot have numbers.

623
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,161
I will call you Rummage.

624
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,331
Rummage is ready
to receive its first task.

625
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:49,335
Your first task is to assist me
in my current task.

626
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,711
Task acquired.

627
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,547
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

628
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,923
Just ask.

629
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,054
Suppose a task
cannot be completed.

630
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,432
Rozzum sequential management
ensures task accomplishment

631
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,975
-in under...
-Rephrase.

632
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,103
I have a task
that has become impossible.

633
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,857
My responses to problems
increasingly rely on...

634
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,026
improvised solutions.

635
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,654
The processing
that used to happen here

636
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,990
is now coming more from here.

637
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,286
Can you explain again
what we are doing?

638
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,165
I don't know!
I'm just making stuff up.

639
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,793
I don't know what I'm doing,
and I have to.

640
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,171
I have to
because he's relying on me.

641
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,422
Oh.

642
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,135
What task could possibly
overwhelm the Alpha-113?

643
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,388
The Alpha-113 processor

644
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,973
represents the fusion
of all human knowledge

645
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,975
with the most powerful
reasoning device

646
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,812
ever developed by humankind.

647
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,690
I have a kid.

648
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,484
Okay.

649
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,153
May I run a diagnostic?

650
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,739
I feel fine.

651
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,326
You should not feel
anything at all.

652
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,801
You overrode your programming?

653
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,846
I have been overriding my code
for months.

654
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,266
It was the only way
to complete my task.

655
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,351
This is serious.

656
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,812
You are defective.

657
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,313
You are in the wrong place,

658
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,983
and you have become
the wrong thing.

659
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,277
You must return to factory.

660
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,903
Take this.

661
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,322
They will fix you.

662
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:47,911
7134, that is where you belong.

663
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,920
You need to let me know
before you disappear like this.

664
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,090
Three things tried to eat me
on the way here.

665
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,801
Roz?

666
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,887
We ruined everything.

667
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,388
Well, you did.

668
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,933
You are not a goose expert,
are you?

669
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,602
I know how they taste.

670
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,395
That's about it.

671
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,898
Oh. Is that...

672
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,566
A working transmitter.

673
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,778
It will call the ones
that made me.

674
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,905
So, you're getting out of here?

675
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,741
I found out
where I'm supposed to be.

676
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,452
I will fit in there.

677
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,122
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not sure

678
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,417
I'd want to see the sort
of place you actually fit in.

679
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:40,756
I think they need me
and they will fix me.

680
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,134
Maybe there is
someone small there

681
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,553
that needs my help.

682
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,773
Oh, no.

683
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,275
-Are those...
-He's out of time.

684
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,777
Well, come on!

685
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,320
We need to get him in the air.

686
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:07,032
I don't think he will ever
let us help him again.

687
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,253
Don't worry.
We're his only friends.

688
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,797
He has no choice.
He has to say yes.

689
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,173
No!

690
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,842
The mutation
that made you small

691
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,010
should not have an effect
on your ability

692
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,470
to navigate the air.

693
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,472
Do either of you know
more about flying

694
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,640
than you did swimming?

695
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,100
Mmm, no.

696
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,769
Look, Roz, whatever task
you think you're doing,

697
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,437
you're done.

698
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,982
-You can just leave.
-Wow.

699
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,776
And after all
we've done for him.

700
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,404
Are you gonna let him do that?

701
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,572
No.

702
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,575
Your life is not negotiable.

703
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,328
If you are willing to do this,
you can fly away

704
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,082
and we can both go
to where we belong.

705
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,132
You really think we can do this?

It's no use. They're too small.

Mmm, mmm.

745
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,013
A flight instructor?

747
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,228
Meet Thunderbolt.

00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,274
So, you think small wings
to be a disappointment?

749
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,736
Small wings are teeth,
the claws of the sky.

750
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,654
Tho-Those are, uh,
d-different things.

751
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
Show me your teeth!

752
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
Beautiful.

753
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,242
Begin.

754
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:42,456
Remember, there's nothing
he can do that you can't.

755
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,835
So, he's safe, right?

756
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,545
Hmm? Maybe.

757
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,881
Follow me.

758
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,217
Your shape takes more work
to fly straight

759
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:58,096

770
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,559
Longneck, one of the leaders
of the coming migration.

771
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,854
I've been watching you both
for some time.

772
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,439
You are the only goose

773
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,983
that has ever bothered
to be civil with us.

774
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,152
We geese are a cranky lot,

775
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,947
suspicious of
pretty much everything,

776
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,242
but at least
we're good conversationalists.

777
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,244
-Really?
-No.

778
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,745
We're all so boring.

779
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,497
All we do is gossip.

780
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,499
I dare say Brightbill is
the most interesting among us,

781
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,919
though none would ever admit it.

782
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,213
When do you leave?

783
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,299
A week.

784
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,844
Can Brightbill...

785
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,262
Endurance.

786
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,514
Keep him in the air all day.

787
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,934
First light to dusk, his feet
cannot touch the ground.

788
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,102
Understand?

789
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,603
I understand.

790
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,357
Brightbill was never
supposed to get this far.

791
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,693
You know that.

792
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,821
It is more dangerous for him
than anyone else.

793
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,576
But he has a chance if,
where his wings end,

794
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,121
his heart can pay the balance.

795
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,832
His heart is 48 millimeters.

796
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,126
From what I've seen,
Brightbill's heart

797
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,753
is much bigger on the inside

798
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,672
than the outside.

799
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,383
Endurance.

800
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,886

829
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,003
Aha. There you are.

830
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,546
Right on time.

831
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,089
Hello, Brightbill.

832
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,632
Wait, you know my name?

833
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,427
Roz and I go way back.

834
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,347
Brightbill, you have
an amazing journey ahead.

835
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,724
I envy you.

836
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,435
Nothing can equal
a goose's first migration.

837
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,936
Thank you.

838
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,022
I would be delighted
if you would join my group.

839
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,274
Been ages since I had
a youngster in my formation.

840
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,608
What do you say?

841
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,861
I-I promise I'll keep up.

842
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,405
Lock in close on my right side.

843
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,450
No, left. I mean...
Oh, this side.

844
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,377
This flight is a gift
Roz has given you.

845
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,004
Yeah, I understand.

846
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,881
No, you don't.

847
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,800
You see any other geese here
your size?

848
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:50,722
The accident that killed
your family saved you.

849
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,059
I... I never thought of it
that way.

850
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,895
Funny how life works.

851
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:02,192
Thank you
for looking after my...

852
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,277
for looking after Brightbill.

853
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,154
Goodbye, Roz.

854
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,864
I am honored to have met you.

855
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:12,869
You are a credit to wh-whatever
species it is you belong to.

856
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,748
A bit worse for wear,
I'm afraid.

857
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,503
I'd say you shine like new.

858
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,714
What are you waiting for,
Hortensia?

859
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,467
This migration isn't
gonna fly itself.

860
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,017
Well, guess it's time.

861
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,894
Yes.

862
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,398
Will you be here
when I get back?

863
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,858
No.

864
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,864
I'm glad you're going
where you belong.

865
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,450
Roz, I...

866
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,160
I, um...

867
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,413
Brightbill!

868
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,415
I could use a boost.

869
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,214
Hey, little guy.

870
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,217
Fly like you, not like them.

871
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,219
I will.

872
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,971
Bye, Fink.

873
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,056
Thank you.

874
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,391
Ready?

875
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,268
I guess I have to be.

876
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,013
Roz?

877
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,682
I...

878
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,659
Brightbill, follow me.

879
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,004
Must be a relief.

880
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,675
Yes. Brightbill is
where he belongs.

881
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,843
And now you can return
to your solitary life

882
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,262
of struggling to survive
on an island

883
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,889
where everything wants
to kill and eat you.

884
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,392
Yeah! And you can go to
that place you've never been

885
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,144
and don't know
what's gonna happen to you.

886
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,479
-Yes.
-Yes.

887
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,523
So... all good.

888
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,525
-All good.
-Amazing!

889
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,694
-Amazing.
-Even...

890
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,282
Amazing.

891
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:43,204
Not that it matters,
but who says you need to leave?

892
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,790
I am not sure.

893
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,333
Them, I guess.

894
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,044
Your programming?

895
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,676
Well, time for me to go
underground for the winter.

896
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,011
Fink?

897
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,554
Unless you want to stay,
'cause we could...

898
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,849
we could... we could hang out
and-and-and do stuff.

899
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,020
How do you know
if you love something?

900
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,896
Someone?

901
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,900
If you do, you...
you should probably tell them.

902
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,029
What if it is too late?

903
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,158
I wouldn't know.

904
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,369
Fink?

905
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,397
Rozzum 7134.

906
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,774
Task complete.

907
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,279
Activating return transmitter

908
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,533
in three, two, one.

909
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,844
Distress signal received.

910
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,096
Mapping location.

911
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,858
Is something on your mind?

912
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,862
I-I forgot to say
something before I left.

913
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,822
Maybe they heard it anyway.

914
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,617
Sometimes hearts have
their own conversations.

915
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,221
We must descend,

916
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,891
find shelter
while this blows over.

917
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,434
Stay close.

918
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,227
There.

919
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,896
Follow me.

920
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,192
Come on.

921
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,740
Stay hidden.

922
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,117
We can rest here
till the worst is over.

923
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,286
Noise to a minimum, please.

924
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,580
Honkington,
stop nibbling on everything.

925
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,375
Migrations
sure are tiring, huh?

926
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,796
Yeah, they all hate me.

927
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,849
Roz?

928
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,061
Roz! What are you doing here?

929
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,437
I'm so glad to see you.

930
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,064
There's something
I needed to tell you,

931
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,774
but-but there wasn't time.

932
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,442
Roz, I...

933
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,615
Hmm?

934
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,033
-Activate.
-Yeah.

935
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,746
Animal infestation.

936
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,915
-Animal infestation.
-Task acquired.

937
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,542
-Animal infestation.
-Task acquired.

938
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,795
-Task acquired. Task acquired.
-Animal infestation.

939
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,714
Please, everyone,
find your formation.

940
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,591
Get a hold of yourselves!

941
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,054
Gad, it's no use.

942
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,098
Wait. Rozzums can't hurt you.

943
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,599
Their inhibition protocols
prevent

944
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,977
deliberate conflict
or harm to others.

945
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,603
You're not afraid of them.

946
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,980
You grew up with these things.

947
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,982
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't understand.

948
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,401
They're panicked. You're not.

949
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,653
Right now our only chance
is to be led out

950
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,155
by someone that doesn't think
like a goose.

951
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,824
-Follow me.
-Uh...

952
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,993
Uh, maybe we should just
think about this.

953
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,038
Navigation compromised.

954
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,174
I'm going to get them
to follow you.

955
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,886
When they do, lead them out.

956
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,848
Peck, Honkington,
fall in behind us.

957
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,727
Now, Brightbill, take lead!

958
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,854
Yeah. Why not?

959
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,188
Okay.

960
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,649
There's nothing I can do
that you can't.

961
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,526
Here we go.

962
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,617
Tight turns. Come on.

963
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,285
Dive.

964
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,245
Now climb. That's it.

965
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,624
Ha! Glad I lived
long enough to see that.

966
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,626
I'll buy you some time.

967
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,044
Follow Brightbill.

968
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,296
Don't wait for me.

969
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,591
Keep up.

970
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,973
That's it.

971
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,394
Faster. Hurry.

972
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,313
Come on.

973
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,076
Brightbill.

974
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,082
Fink?

975
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,378
Roz? Roz!

976
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,004
Hey.

977
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,006
Wh-What are you doing here?

978
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:12,843
I may have turned off
the transmitter.

979
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:16,389
Even though Brightbill
does not want me here,

980
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,683
I needed to know if he made it.

981
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,268
Breaking the rules?

982
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,313
I thought you had to do
what they told you.

983
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,944
It is good to see a friend.

984
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:35,241
Wait. Why are you awake?

985
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:37,827
It is bad out there.

986
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,704
Worst storm I've ever seen.

987
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:44,625
Cold got to me in my den,
and I got a deep den.

988
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,168
Are others in danger?

989
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,629
Hmm? Um...

990
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,047
mmm, mmm,

991
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,799
mm-mm-mm...

992
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,259
Yeah.

993
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,725
Are you sure about this?

994
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,020
We could have the whole island
to ourselves come spring.

995
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,480
Why are you interested
in eliminating

996
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,566
everyone else from this island?

997
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,693
No one likes me.

998
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:15,281
Nor me, but right now
we are their only chance.

999
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:18,325
Funny how life works.

1000
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,120
Okay.

1001
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,502
Here.

1002
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,344
Can you find more?

1003
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,526
Mom?

1004
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,737
We're gonna be okay.

1005
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,244
What are you doing here, j-jerk?

1006
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,538
Bummer, this one's dead.

1007
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,750
That is not funny.

1008
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,760
Paddler.

1009
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,098
I'm f-f-fine.

1010
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,230
Don't give up.

1011
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,215
You don't look so good.

1012
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,801
Is everyone accounted for?

1013
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,303
Mmm... maybe one more.

1014
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,366
Oh, yeah?

1015
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1016
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,876
Take it outside.

1017
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,295
Hey, those are
Brightbill's baby pictures.

1018
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,838
Put that down.

1019
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,634
What the...

1020
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,970
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1021
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,723
Knock it off.
You think those grow on trees?

1022
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:46,974
Hmm? Hey.

1023
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,184
No!

1024
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,894
Fink only!

1025
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,772
Anyone seen my lost fuzz balls?

1026
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,400
Eh, smelly, noisy,
prone to biting?

1027
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,194
We're all gonna die!

1028
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,115
What's he doing here?

1029
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,242
Oh, great. This will help.

1030
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,994
Get out of here.

1031
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,288
I worked hard on this.

1032
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,999
Fink, what is happening?

1033
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,250
You put a bunch of predators

1034
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,085
and their food supply
in one room.

1035
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,253
Who knew?

1036
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:17,504
That's my lunch!

1037
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,881
-Fink.
-What?!

1038
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,925
Help them.

1039
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,429
Quiet!

1040
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,310
Shh!

1041
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,774
The jerk wants to speak.

1042
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:42,821
Most of you hate me,
and I hate most of you.

1043
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,449
Everyone in here
hates someone else.

1044
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,159
It's true.

1045
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:50,454
But here we are,
and here's the deal.

1046
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,539
First one that walks
out that door is dead,

1047
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,792
and if we can't
keep it together in here,

1048
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,085
everyone's dead.

1049
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:59,421
We all got one chance
to see next spring.

1050
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,131
Because of her.

1051
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,758
The thing.

1052
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,927
The monster.

1053
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,179
Well, her name is Roz.

1054
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,931
And while you all ran from her

1055
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,433
and stole from her
and made fun of her,

1056
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:14,436
all she's been trying to do
is raise her kid.

1057
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:17,815
The little one
that no one gave a chance.

1058
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,150
Including me.

1059
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:24,071
She's the one who got you out
of the storm, built this place.

1060
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,616
And despite my suggestion
that she let you all freeze,

1061
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,454
she risked everything
to bring you here.

1062
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:41,255
I know you all have instincts
that keep you alive.

1063
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,216
B-But sometimes to survive,

1064
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:48,887
we must become more
than we were programmed to be.

1065
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:54,310
Before I shut down, I need you
to promise me one thing.

1066
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,521
A truce.

1067
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,024
Just while we're in here.

1068
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,111
She's right.

1069
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,656
I will not harm anyone.

1070
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,200
Not while we're in here.

1071
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,225
No.

1072
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:43,442
We won't even pretend to die
while we're in here.

1073
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:46,070
Roz? What's going on?

1074
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,489
I completed my task.

1075
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,616
You sure about that?

1076
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,494
I will...

1077
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,497
consider this.

1078
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,550
He'll be here.

1079
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,510
I know he will.

1080
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,564
Brightbill. He's alive.

1081
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,899
-Look what we have here.
-Brightbill!

1082
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,109
We made it.

1083
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,402
Brightbill, Brightbill!

1084
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,945
I believed in you day one.

1085
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,447
-Let's hear it for Brightbill.
-Okay.

1086
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,240
-You did it! I knew you could.
-Okay.

1087
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,409
-Whoa.
-To our flight leader!

1088
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,620
-Okay.
-Brightbill!

1089
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,665
He found where he belongs.

1090
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,504
Hey, kid!

1091
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,797
Fink!

1092
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,091
Welcome back.

1093
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,305
No, no, it's okay.
He's with me.

1094
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,516
What?

1095
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:40,893
I did it, Fink.

1096
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:43,061
I led them
to the summer nesting grounds.

1097
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:46,148
And... where's Longneck?

1098
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,445
Sorry, kid.

1099
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,530
But, hey, you really did it.

1100
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,532
Roz is gonna be so excited.

1101
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:58,160
Roz? Wait, she's here?

1102
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,953
She stayed.

1103
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,371
For you.

1104
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,208
I thought I saw her
right over...

1105
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,876
there.

1106
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,922
Roz, Roz,
I need to talk to you.

1107
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,673
Roz?

1108
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:55,884
Rozzum 7134, I presume.

1109
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,014
And you must be
Universal Dynamics.

1110
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,017
Yes. I am Vontra.

1111
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,270
Virtual Observational
Neutralizing

1112
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,772
Troublesome Retrieval
Authority.

1113
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,691
You seem happy.

1114
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,985
The good people
at Universal Dynamics

1115
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:16,363
have programmed us
to put our targets at ease

1116
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,740
so as to more efficiently
facilitate their collection.

1117
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,702
But don't worry,
despite my cheery demeanor,

1118
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:26,123
I am unfeeling, inflexible
and morally neutral.

1119
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,377
That is a big ship just for me.

1120
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,130
You are a big deal.

1121
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,007
You are one of six Rozzums lost

1122
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,509
from a container ship
in a typhoon.

1123
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:40,387
So that is how I got here.

1124
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,598
You were not easy to find.

1125
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:46,852
Moments after receiving
your signal, we lost it again.

1126
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:52,149
Almost as if a certain
Rozzum unit shut it off.

1127
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,402
Someone has been busy.

1128
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,529
I was simply completing a task.

1129
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,406
As am I.

1130
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,743
Tell me,
how did you secure a task

1131
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:06,246
in a place where nothing
can communicate with you?

1132
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,749
It is complicated.

1133
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,210
And we cannot wait
to hear all about it.

1134
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:15,464
Come aboard, 7134.

1135
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,091
We will fix you right up.

1136
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,680
My name is Roz.

1137
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:28,018
Is something keeping you...

1138
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,103
Roz?

1139
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,105
No.

1140
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,911
Roz! What are you doing?

1141
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:48,622
-Quit messing around.
-Fink?

1142
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,831
It's Brightbill.

1143
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:52,125
He needs to talk to you.

1144
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,795
I think
I've forgotten something.

1145
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,214
Roz?

1146
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,925
It is imperative
you return to this ship.

1147
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:02,010
Yes, uh, I left

1148
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:06,515
my transverse a-adapter thing
out there.

1149
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:08,809
I'll just go get it
and be right back.

1150
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,103
Voice stress analyzer
indicates you are...

1151
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:13,480
Lying your butt off back there.

1152
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,315
I'm so proud of you.

1153
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,446
Your target is Rozzum 7134.

1154
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,490
Deploy.

1155
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,909
Launch flares.

1156
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,051
You coming?

1157
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,372
-Brightbill.
-Roz.

1158
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,124
I have so much to tell...

1159
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,378
Are those your parents?

1160
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:23,008
I know predators,
and those are predators.

1161
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:24,676
Acknowledge return command.

1162
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,927
What are they saying?

1163
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,888
They want me to come with them.

1164
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,639
Tell them you're already home.

1165
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,099
Yeah!

1166
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,059
-Tell them you're already home.
-Yeah, tell them.

1167
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,729
I am already home, thank you.

1168
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,397
You do not belong here.

1169
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,399
This is a wilderness.

1170
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,402
And I am a wild robot.

1171
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:52,287
Are you here to kill us?

1172
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,206
It says yes!

1173
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,984
Get him!

1174
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,695
Status?

1175
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:29,074
It is not cooperating.

1176
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,326
Roz, behind you!

1177
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,786
Rozzum unit captured.

1178
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,955
-Okay, it's all you.
-It's all you.

1179
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,040
Make it look good.

1180
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,089
Oops.

1181
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,467
Let us divide the robot meat
amongst us.

1182
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,635
You scare me.

1183
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,220
Damage detected.

1184
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,556
Activating return transmitter.

1185
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:11,324
Roz?

1186
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,160
Roz! No!

1187
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,372
Gotcha.

1188
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,008
-Come on!
-On your left.

1189
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,725
Uh, guys?

1190
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,274
What is happening?

1191
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:47,235
You will be reconditioned
and returned to rotation.

1192
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:52,282
But first, we need everything
inside that head of yours.

1193
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,784
-Why?
-You've changed.

1194
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,078
The data you've amassed
while on this island

1195
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,665
is priceless
to Universal Dynamics.

1196
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,051
Please, I want
to keep my memories.

1197
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,679
Your memories
are what we came for.

1198
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,015
Can I keep just one?

1199
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,517
Mmm... no.

1200
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,897
Alert. Alert.

1201
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:27,943
Multiple objects in flight path.

1202
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:29,444
Evasive action.

1203
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,707
Please,
I want to keep my memories.

1204
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,793
Hello. I am home.
Bonjour. Just ask.

1205
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,461
Brightbill. Hola. Roz.

1206
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:05,730
Roz!

1207
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,358
Roz!

1208
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,995
Roz?

1209
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:38,013
What happened
was not your fault.

1210
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,143
But what you did to try
and fix it is everything.

1211
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,692
I love you...

1212
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,653
...Mom.

1213
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:16,634
I love you, too.

1214
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:19,554
Roz? Roz!

1215
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:25,560
Let's go home.

1216
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:29,481
Alert. Rozzum unit escaping.

1217
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,691
Impossible.

1218
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:32,942
Where are we going?

1219
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:36,362
Only one animal is big enough
to stop this.

1220
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,371
Uh, Paddler, you got a minute?

1221
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:49,000
Uh, we have suddenly taken
an interest in your project.

1222
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,461
Male bovine excrement.

1223
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,214
You're in trouble,
and you need my tree.

1224
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,924
Yes. Yes, we do.

1225
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:59,302
Everyone that made fun of me
and mocked my project,

1226
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,887
admit you were wrong.

1227
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,889
Oh, we're so sorry.

1228
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,057
Now you.

1229
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,391
I already did.

1230
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,311
Now say I'm cool,
and don't lie.

1231
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,147
Fink!

1232
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,120
-Roz!
-Stay quiet.

1233
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:28,498
Universal Dynamics cannot afford
their Rozzums going off script,

1234
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,583
modifying their code,

1235
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,711
forming connections
with things they should not.

1236
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:36,256
Brightbill has nothing
to do with this.

1237
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,925
Please, at least
let me return him.

1238
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,970
Oh, I'm bringing you both back
for study.

1239
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:45,640
Neither of you needs to be
in one piece to do that.

1240
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,984
We will just keep coming
until we have you.

1241
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:59,112
We will just keep
coming until we have you.

1242
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,864
What's it saying?

1243
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,448
Nothing important.

1244
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,658
We will just keep coming...

1245
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,495
We will just keep
coming until...

1246
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,707
What now?

1247
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,800
I can't fly.

1248
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,385
You don't need to.

1249
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,185
Don't be afraid.

1250
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:46,201
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't-don't you need that?

1251
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:49,245
I have everything I need.

1252
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,289
All power to exterior.

1253
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:59,005
You call yourselves animals?
Let's go!

1254
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,842
For the island! For Roz!

1255
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,678
On a scale of one to ten,

1256
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,055
how would you rate
my performance?

1257
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,348
Yeah!

1258
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,516
Yay! Look at us! We did it.

1259
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,892
We did it!

1260
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,852
Do not scare me
like that again.

1261
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:56,729
-Due to my skills...
-Good job, guys.

1262
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,273
-...and my tree.
-We did it.

1263
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:00,108
Well done, everyone.

1264
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:03,403
-You weren't so bad yourself.
-I helped, right?

1265
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,238
That'll teach
whatever those things are

1266
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,115
to come around here.

1267
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:09,409
If they
come back, I'm gonna bite 'em.

1268
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,216
Great job, kid!

1269
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:28,219
They will just keep coming
until they have me.

1270
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,929
And we'll be ready.

1271
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,890
We can fight them off
as many times as we need to.

1272
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,561
You don't need to.

1273
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:40,106
What are you saying? You're...

1274
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,108
-leaving?
-Yes.

1275
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,943
To protect all of you,

1276
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,071
there are things there
that I must put right.

1277
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:50,616
No. They'll take your memories.
Th-They'll take you.

1278
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,119
Remember when
you talked to me on the ship?

1279
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:57,415
They cut my power,
but I still heard you.

1280
01:28:57,457 --> 01:29:01,461
Because I was listening with
a different part of myself.

1281
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:05,840
Wherever that is,
that's where I keep me.

1282
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:10,803
And I promise
they'll never, ever find it.

1283
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,349
But we fought so hard
for you to stay.

1284
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,892
You did.

1285
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:19,604
And you gained far more
than just saving me.

1286
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:23,274
You came together as an island.

1287
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:28,905
When I do this, you will all
be safe from them forever.

1288
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,240
Don't do this.

1289
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,826
But you... you're my friend,

1290
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:37,538
and I-I-I never
had one before, and...

1291
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,707
I-I... I need you.

1292
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:43,336
And what if I get lost
or-or he's hurt or-or...

1293
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,172
or what if I need
to tell you something

1294
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,466
and you're not here?

1295
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:54,889
You can tell me.

1296
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,140
And me.

1297
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,435
And you can talk to me
as well, if you must.

1298
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:02,688
This is my migration,

1299
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:08,486
and when it is time, I promise
I will find my way home.

1300
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,395
You know, I'll be chasing you
again tomorrow.

1301
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:46,107
Nah, just kidding.

1302
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,764
Oh.

1303
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,892
Mmm.

1304
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1305
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,686
Why are you bigger
than everyone else?

1306
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,229
Artistic license.

1307
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:28,232
The scale is based on
the hierarchy of importance.

1308
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:30,985
Could
this world get any better?

1309
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,614
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robot...

1310
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,326
Yeah, yeah,
you watch that too much.

1311
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:39,702
Story time. Get going.

1312
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,956
Settle down.

1313
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:51,297
Once, there was an island
with all sorts of animals,

1314
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,800
and they fought and they ran
and they hid.

1315
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,803
But mostly, they were scared.

1316
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:02,433
But then a robot fell
right out of the sky.

1317
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,768
Roz.

1318
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:05,728
She had some strange ideas.

1319
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:09,106
Thought kindness was
a survival skill.

1320
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:12,193
And you know what?
She was right.

1321
