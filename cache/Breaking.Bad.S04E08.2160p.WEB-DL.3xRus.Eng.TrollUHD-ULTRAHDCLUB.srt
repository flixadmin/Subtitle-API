1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,922
- Are we done?
- Listen, I...

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,218
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,178
Please.

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,598
I fear for my family.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,314
I'm told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,524
It's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,403
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,909
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,954
Guys, guys, hurry up.

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,124
- Can we go now?
- Upstairs, come on.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,834
What's happening?

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,836
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,215
Time of death, 20:43.

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,552
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,353
<i>One of the gunmen died at the scene.</i>

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>The second succumbed to his wounds
earlier this evening.</i>

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,608
<i>Agents with the DEA and FBI</i>

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement</i>

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>in an attempt to identify
the deceased suspects. Both...</i>

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,885
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,764
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,559
They continued to press me
for my permission to kill Walter White.

24
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,398
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,484
But a phone call was placed

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,362
to Agent Schrader
moments before the attack.

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,115
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,284
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

29
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,538
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,583
The warning call to the DEA agent

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,462
Juan Bolsa may have some insight

32
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,756
into who placed it.

33
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,175
Yesterday, <i>federales</i> raided his hacienda.

34
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,429
And in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.

35
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,265
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,018
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,688
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,567
At any rate,
I thought you should hear it from me.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,414
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,552
{\an8}So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,223
{\an8}What?

42
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,517
{\an8}I can never remember.

43
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,521
{\an8}Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

44
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,357
{\an8}No. This is the PET/CT scan.

45
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,902
{\an8}Positron emission tomography.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:04,654
{\an8}They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.

47
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,998
{\an8}Quiet. No magnets.

48
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
{\an8}Right, okay.

49
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,460
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,339
{\an8}I'm still pretty new at this.

51
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,008
{\an8}One minute, I'm starting a new business

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,386
{\an8}my wife and I are thinking about kids.

53
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,180
{\an8}Walk into a doctor's office
and suddenly...

54
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,684
{\an8}- I mean, life as I know it...
- Excuse me.

55
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,312
Yes. I'm waiting
to hear a progress report

56
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,191
on the thing we discussed, so call me.

57
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,240
Anyway, so for me,
that's been the biggest wake-up call.

58
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,368
Letting go, giving up control.

59
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,581
You know, it's like they say,
"Man plans and God laughs."

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,544
{\an8}That is such bullshit.

61
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,296
Excuse me?

62
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,007
{\an8}Never give up control.

63
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,969
{\an8}Live life on your own terms.

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
{\an8}Yeah, no, I get what you're saying,

65
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,558
{\an8}but cancer is cancer, so...

66
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,768
{\an8}To hell with your cancer.

67
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,085
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

68
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,109
{\an8}From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

69
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,986
{\an8}Well, guess what?

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,489
{\an8}Every life comes with a death sentence.

71
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:28,036
So every few months,
I come in here for my regular scan

72
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,081
{\an8}knowing full well
that one of these times...

73
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,667
{\an8}Hell, maybe even today.

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,546
{\an8}... I'm gonna hear some bad news.

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
{\an8}But until then

76
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,009
{\an8}who's in charge?

77
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,886
Me.

78
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,016
{\an8}That's how I live my life.

79
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,620
This residue here is why we descale
with cool water

80
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,331
{\an8}from the walk-in
and not water from the tap.

81
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,375
{\an8}Do it again, please.

82
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,631
{\an8}Pollos Hermanos, where something
delicious is always cooking.

83
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,009
{\an8}Yes, detective.

84
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah.

85
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,539
- Gustavo, thanks for coming.
- Pleasure.

86
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,250
{\an8}- How's Kathi?
- Much better, thank you.

87
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,128
{\an8}- And you know Hank Schrader?
- Yes, indeed.

88
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,755
{\an8}- And Steve Gomez?
- How was your meal?

89
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,258
{\an8}Agent Schrader and I had a chance
to catch up at one of my restaurants.

90
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,721
I'd eat there every day
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

91
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
- Well, should we get started?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,019
- I'd like to record this conversation.
- Of course.

93
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:26,571
{\an8}The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own,

94
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,489
{\an8}so I've asked them to sit in.

95
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,326
{\an8}Gus, we all appreciate your coming
in here to talk to us,

96
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,413
{\an8}but you have the right
to have an attorney present.

97
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,833
{\an8}Oh, well, I can't see
how that would be necessary.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,043
{\an8}But then, I have no idea why I'm here.

99
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,837
{\an8}So you wish to continue?

100
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,759
{\an8}Please. I'm very anxious
to find out what this is all about.

101
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,596
{\an8}Sir, your fingerprints were found
at a crime scene.

102
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,057
Really? That's surprising.

103
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,894
A drug-related homicide.

104
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,235
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

105
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,074
So you knew the victim?

106
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,417
Fifteen years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

107
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,295
I named it after Maximino Arciniega

108
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,631
a dear friend of mine who died young.

109
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,383
Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.

110
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,721
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

111
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,640
I see.

112
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,353
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,356
- 1999.
- That sounds right.

114
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,484
And you kept in contact with him
over all this time?

115
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:51,239
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

116
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,450
- Ran into him where?
- At the restaurant.

117
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,412
Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate,
as I assumed

118
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,583
he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

119
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,504
He invited me to dinner
the following night and I accepted.

120
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,051
It was perhaps a week later
when I read about him in the paper.

121
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,054
- Drug related, you said?
- It's a good possibility.

122
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,515
The paper made no mention of that.

123
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,393
I assumed that it was a random crime.

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,772
So after years with no contact,
he shows up in your restaurant,

125
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,317
- and invites you to dinner?
- He wanted money.

126
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,445
- Gale Boetticher asked for money?
- He didn't say that.

127
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,576
He spoke in terms
of a vague investment opportunity.

128
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,788
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

129
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:46,294
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood

130
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,547
he was more interested
in taking shortcuts

131
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,467
than what would or could have been
a very promising career.

132
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,803
Personal shortcomings notwithstanding

133
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,180
he was a warm, gentle person,

134
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,766
and I thought a lot of him.

135
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,939
At any rate,
I declined his business offer,

136
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,484
and after
what was a very pleasant meal, left.

137
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,862
Can you tell us where you were

138
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,657
on the night of Wednesday the 23rd
at around 8 p.m.?

139
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:21,537
- Not an accusation, just a question.
- No, I understand. Let's see.

140
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,333
Twenty-third.

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,378
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

142
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,256
I was there from 7 to about 10.

143
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,554
Anyone else?

144
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,352
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

145
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,438
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?

146
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,442
Is it my real name?

147
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,321
I know you're a Chilean national,

148
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,699
but there are no records of you
ever living there.

149
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
Really?

150
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,915
I mean, records show that you
immigrated to Mexico in 1986,

151
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,503
and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

152
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,759
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring
ever having existed in Chile

153
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,971
which I find, I don't know, strange.

154
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,556
Well, no, really, it isn't.

155
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,810
Pinochet's government
was guilty of many sins.

156
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,354
First and foremost
were human rights abuses.

157
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,441
But it was also notoriously unreliable
at keeping records.

158
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,654
I'm sure if you keep digging,
you'll find me.

159
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,118
Okay, I think that's it, Gus.
Thank you.

160
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,870
I hope that I was of some small help.

161
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,624
- You were, absolutely. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

162
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,459
Good to see you again. Oh, no.

163
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,129
- No, please, please. Don't get up.
- Thanks.

164
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,011
Gentlemen.

165
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,661
So are we buying?

166
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,178
This thing with his name?
What are you thinking?

167
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,458
Sure, the record-keeping
in South America's hit or miss.

168
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,127
I mean, we run into that all the time,
right?

169
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:37,048
But we usually find something.
Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

170
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,261
If State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalized him.

171
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,931
Well, maybe,
but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

172
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,434
State just wasn't as tough
on background checks pre-9/11.

173
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,855
I don't know what this has to do
with the case at hand.

174
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,817
I was curious when his print showed up
at Boetticher's apartment.

175
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,069
For me, the scholarship explains it.

176
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,530
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

177
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,658
This man has been a longtime friend
of DEA.

178
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,788
But that being said,
I thought his story was credible.

179
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,749
Well, I agree.
I think it was a good story.

180
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,127
Still, why are we hearing it now?

181
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,336
What do you mean?

182
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,174
Well, like you said, he's a... This man
is a big law enforcement booster.

183
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,178
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with

184
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,973
someone he thought a lot of was murdered.

185
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,976
He reads this
and he doesn't make a phone call?

186
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,564
Didn't call you
or one of his other cop friends

187
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,693
to share his connection with the case
or ask about the investigation?

188
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,988
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation

189
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,324
on a person not making phone calls.

190
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,785
What do you think, Tim?

191
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,831
Well, I wanna follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi,

192
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,000
but my overall impression?

193
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,376
I believed him.

194
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,140
Nice touch. Birdbath.

195
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,102
- Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
- Good.

196
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,107
Yeah, so very nice.

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,442
What's the damage?

198
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,655
Twelve hundred a month.
I did a lot of research.

199
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,492
- That's a pretty good deal.
- You kidding me? That's a great deal.

200
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,577
Speaking of which

201
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,996
that's for the week.

202
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:36,000
Plus there's a little extra in there
for any move-related incidentals.

203
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,251
Thank you.

204
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,838
- Hey, champ, how's the new school?
- Good.

205
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,966
I loved school when I was your age.

206
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,803
Seesaws, story time,
chasing girls with sticks.

207
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,275
It wasn't until the fifth grade
that I found out she liked me too,

208
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,405
but by then her family had moved
to Scottsdale, so...

209
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,034
- Carpe diem, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,744
All right. Good boy.

211
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,290
So you'll thank Jesse again
from both of us?

212
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,834
You got it.

213
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,714
- So is he... How's he doing?
- Jesse?

214
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,016
He's good. He's busy.

215
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,817
How is it?

216
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:47,864
Space, lots of light. It's...
Little garden out back. It's nice.

217
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,326
And Brock? How's he doing?

218
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,913
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off every week

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,540
like Ed McMahon,

220
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,126
but if you wanna know how they're doing

221
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,087
why don't you go see for yourself?

222
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,469
I'll catch you later.

223
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,473
- Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
- No.

224
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,186
Great.

225
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,151
Anyway, I'm proud for not losing my cool.

226
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,196
Plus, it shows our crew
that I will support them

227
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,240
if a customer's being rude.

228
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,868
You're really taking to this whole
be-your-own-boss thing.

229
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,539
Yeah. I guess I am.

230
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,791
Actually

231
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,003
I'm thinking about making the move
up to management.

232
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,089
Jesus. Corporate America, look out.

233
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,967
Excuse me, I would be a vast improvement.

234
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,096
No one in Kleinman's entire front office
knows about giving an x-ray

235
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,931
which is just...

236
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,059
Hey, Dad, whatever happened
with your scan?

237
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,353
Did you get the results back?

238
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,732
Yeah, I did,

239
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,110
and I'm still in remission.

240
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,823
So you're all gonna have to be stuck
with me for a while longer.

241
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,074
Cheers, buddy.

242
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,163
What about you, Hank?
How you feeling these days?

243
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,373
You know, getting there.

244
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,086
The other day, he had a big powwow
with all the DEA muckety-mucks.

245
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,755
What was that about?

246
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,009
Nothing. Just a dead-end.

247
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,927
He won't tell me, either.

248
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,221
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

249
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,434
Hey, Walt, do me a favor?

250
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,938
Marie's working tomorrow
and there's a gem and mineral show

251
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,610
opening at the fairgrounds.
I wondered if you could give me a lift?

252
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,654
Yeah. Sure.

253
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,490
I had a collection of my own
in high school.

254
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,286
I mean, nothing fancy.
Just entry-level beryls and garnets

255
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,914
one passable black tourmaline.

256
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
- Turn right here.
- Okay.

257
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:50,922
But I did have one piece of morganite
that was very special.

258
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,551
It'd been heat-treated,
so it had that classic cast to it.

259
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,472
That rose, almost salmon hue, you know?

260
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,266
Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay?

261
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,646
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
Here. Take a right here.

262
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,818
Freak about what?

263
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
Hank, where are we going?

264
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,412
Are you hungry?

265
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,083
We're not here for the chicken.

266
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,835
Kill the engine.

267
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,174
All right.

268
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,344
You ready for your mind to be blown?

269
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,554
Sure.

270
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,642
Gustavo Fring, remember him?

271
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,312
He came to the hospital
after the shooting. Put up the reward?

272
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,942
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run
every year. You've met him?

273
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:58,322
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah.
That guy, yeah. What about him?

274
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,994
Well, I suspect... I can't prove it,
mind you, but I suspect

275
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,205
the man's a drug dealer.

276
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,335
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

277
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,797
I mean, honest to God, I really believe

278
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,634
that this guy may be one
of the biggest movers in the southwest.

279
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,177
Remember Gale Boetticher?

280
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,888
- That sad sack from the karaoke tape?
- Yeah.

281
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,018
And you said that he didn't strike you
as being the boss-man type?

282
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,228
That there was a bigger guy out there.

283
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,899
- Hank, that was just speculation.
- Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

284
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,985
And guess what I find?

285
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:40,740
Chicken Man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

286
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,869
- So we bring him in...
- You think that Gustavo Fring

287
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,579
killed Gale Boetticher?

288
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,997
Probably not.

289
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,334
These guys usually get a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

290
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,544
But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So I...

291
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,630
So you brought him in to the police?

292
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,593
Right. He sits down to talk with us,
the problem is that...

293
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,803
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

294
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,348
Walt,
will you let me finish my story here?

295
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,477
Sorry, I'm just interested, you know?

296
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:14,648
All right. Whatever. So we bring him in
and he proceeds to kick our asses.

297
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,818
Okay? He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints.

298
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,822
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
He's got reasons for everything.

299
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,368
This guy
is <i>Terms of Endearment</i> convincing.

300
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,453
So he's not guilty?

301
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,664
Yeah. As far as DEA
and APD are concerned, he's not.

302
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,876
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

303
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,045
But I'm telling you

304
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,882
something deep down says he's my guy.

305
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,218
Just gotta prove it.

306
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,432
Hank, why are you telling me this?

307
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,436
I need a favor.

308
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,814
What favor?

309
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,485
You see that Volvo station wagon
over there?

310
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,030
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo.
It's brilliant.

311
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,282
Anyway, listen

312
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,828
what I need for you to do

313
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,123
stick this on it.

314
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,044
GPS tracker.

315
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:21,632
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around
on her but she wants to be sure?

316
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,094
Stick this on the car...
This part here, it's a magnet.

317
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,928
...and see where he goes.

318
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,264
Cool, huh?

319
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,183
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.

320
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,520
It's not live-view,
so we gotta come back later,

321
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,440
and take it off
and stick it in the computer.

322
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,609
Still, a pretty amazing time
we're living in.

323
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,153
Hank, isn't that illegal?

324
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,449
I mean, isn't there some sort
of unlawful search and something...

325
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:52,371
It's known as extralegal.
But trust me, it's our little secret.

326
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,209
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

327
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,754
You untie your shoelace
and you head toward the restaurant.

328
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,590
You're walking past the car

329
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,676
look down and, "Hey, darn,
my shoe's untied." Okay?

330
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,013
Now, when you bend down to tie your shoe

331
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,307
you stick this into the wheel well.

332
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:16,103
- Then you go inside and I don't know...
- Hank, I don't feel good about this.

333
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,607
I know that this kind of thing
is outside your comfort zone...

334
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,234
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.

335
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,446
Walt,
I need you to help me out here, okay?

336
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,364
This is really important to me.

337
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,868
Are you gonna make me beg?
Come on. Just stick it in there.

338
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,376
Yeah.

339
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,087
Just act normal.

340
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,298
May I help you?

341
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,428
I... I...

342
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,265
Sir, may I help you?

343
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,647
I didn't do it. See?

344
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,400
- I didn't do it.
- Do it.

345
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,613
Do it.

346
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,073
May I help you with your order?

347
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,303
What the hell is he...?

348
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:24,231
Just made sure it was secure.

349
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,067
Hey, where's my soda?

350
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,197
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.

351
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,590
Yes, that one.

352
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:09,235
I swear to God, I thought I was driving
the man to a gem and mineral show.

353
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,530
All of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant,

354
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:15,283
and telling me
that he's investigating you.

355
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,328
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences,

356
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,455
but I would never...

357
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:29,171
Look, my brother-in-law,
evidence-wise, has nothing.

358
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,675
He's operating on pure conjecture.

359
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,594
And no one, not one person
that he works with

360
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:39,599
thinks that you are anyone other
than an owner of a fast-food chain.

361
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,060
But if something were to happen to Hank?

362
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,898
That would only draw their attention
to you and therefore, to me, as well.

363
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:51,528
We have a mutual interest
in resolving this without violence.

364
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,450
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

365
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,086
Jesse!

366
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,840
What? Oh, hey.
Don't wait to be, like, invited.

367
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,844
Are we alone?

368
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,599
- So where do we stand?
- Where do we stand on what?

369
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:25,729
Where do we stand with the thing
that you were supposed to do?

370
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,480
I assume you haven't done it.

371
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:32,360
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

372
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,195
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:38,533
Asshole. You're creaming
to get it done, go do it yourself.

374
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,036
If he didn't see me coming
like he's some kind of...

375
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,707
All right, look.
Our timetable has advanced.

376
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,627
You have got to make this meeting
happen this week.

377
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,755
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

378
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,884
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

379
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,055
My brother-in-law,
my DEA agent brother-in-law?

380
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,600
He's onto Gus.

381
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,859
Did you hear what I just said?
My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

382
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:17,238
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

383
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:26,915
Look. So, what if this is
like math or algebra?

384
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:31,419
We add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag,

385
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:34,130
and you get, like, zero douche bags.

386
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,509
I've got some math for you.

387
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,304
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

388
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:47,018
Hank, he's relentless, all right?
He won't quit.

389
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:50,271
Yeah, well, he's got nothing,
is all I can say.

390
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,650
- How would you know that?
- Because he's still above ground.

391
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:58,613
Think a dude like Gus would let
your boy anywhere near him?

392
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,783
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

393
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:07,705
So you haven't even seen him
since that time at the diner?

394
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,920
Okay.

395
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,551
Think. All right.

396
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,599
They've got to be figuring
that we've talked.

397
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:31,855
So you need to tell Mike that you
are worried about Hank's investigation.

398
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:35,400
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

399
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:40,488
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,
so there's that.

400
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:44,701
This is all good fodder for you
to request a sit-down with Gus,

401
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:48,329
so you can discuss
what you would say for questioning.

402
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,624
Okay? Now, you just say
that you want to be...

403
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,795
No, that you need to be able
to be properly coached.

404
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,089
Then, when you're near him

405
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,799
you put this to use.

406
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,220
Mike's just gonna tell me
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

407
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,182
- He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
- Well, then insist on it, damn it!

408
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,143
Act panicked.

409
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,312
Gus' ass is on the line.

410
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,315
He'll meet with you
if he thinks you're a liability.

411
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,485
No. He will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

412
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,237
You know what?

413
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,114
Whatever, man.

414
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,490
I'm gonna take a piss.

415
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:16,793
I think you got a phone call.

416
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,551
Anything important?

417
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,167
- Yes?
- <i>I did some digging around.</i>

418
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,919
- And?
- Neither the DEA,

419
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,173
nor the APD considers you
a person of interest.

420
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,217
<i>Schrader is looking into you
totally on his lonesome.</i>

421
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,220
- <i>A voice in the wilderness.</i>
- Does he have resources?

422
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,724
<i>Just him, his credit card
and his chauffeur Walter.</i>

423
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:18,395
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

424
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,107
- <i>No warrant for that tracking device?</i>
- No.

425
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,195
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

426
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,239
We watch our backs,
we don't throw him any bones.

427
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,824
He'll never make a case.

428
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,995
- What about Chile?
- <i>If I can't find any trace before '89</i>

429
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,581
<i>I seriously doubt Schrader can.</i>

430
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,709
Seems to me
the bigger problem is the cartel.

431
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,713
Now, we can handle them
if that's all we've got on our plate.

432
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,760
But dealing with both Schrader
and the Mexicans at the same time?

433
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,223
If he happens to be watching
when they make a move

434
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,351
<i>it could be the perfect storm.</i>

435
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,103
Thank you.

436
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,230
I'll be in touch.

437
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,389
<i>I don't know how many grandmas
and grandpas we got.</i>

438
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,808
<i>Is there a couple of them
in viewing land?</i>

439
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,645
<i>Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."</i>

440
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,781
Hello, Hector.

441
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,789
The cartel has given me its ultimatum.

442
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,125
To which I've said no.

443
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:10,799
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

444
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,971
He's looking into my past.

445
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,738
Is today the day, Hector?

446
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,090
<i>Es el</i> businessman.

447
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,436
<i>Regresan</i> high.

448
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,670
Señor?

449
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,882
Businessman.

450
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,705
Look at me, Hector.

451
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:59,507
Look at me.

452
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,573
Maybe next time.
