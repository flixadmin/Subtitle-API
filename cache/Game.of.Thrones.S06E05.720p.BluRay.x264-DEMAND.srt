1
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,771
Yes?

2
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,962
For you, my lady.

3
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,401
How far is Mole's Town?

4
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,366
Sansa.

5
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,205
Lady Brienne.

6
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,803
When I heard you had escaped Winterfell,
I feared the worst.

7
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,051
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you unharmed.

8
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,605
"Unharmed"?

9
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,411
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,445
I rode north with the Knights of the Vale
to come to your aid.

11
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,241
They're encamped at Moat
Cailin as we speak.

12
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,970
To come to my aid?

13
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,491
Did you know about Ramsay?

14
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,608
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
If you did know, you're my enemy.

15
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,282
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

16
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,530
He never hurt my face.

17
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,120
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

18
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,408
But the rest of me,

19
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,168
he did what he liked with the rest of me

20
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,406
as long as I could still give him an heir.

21
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,010
What do you think he did?

22
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,161
- I can't begin to contemplate...
- What do you think he did to me?

23
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,841
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

24
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,288
- He beat you.
- Yes, he enjoyed that.

25
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,169
What else do you think he did?

26
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,800
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

27
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,891
Did he cut you?

28
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,444
Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.

29
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,521
I didn't know.

30
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,602
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,923
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,525
I underestimated a stranger.

33
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
The other things he did,

34
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,563
ladies aren't supposed to
talk about those things,

35
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,371
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,526
I can still feel it.

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,804
I don't mean in my tender heart
it still pains me so.

38
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,204
I can still feel what he did in my body
standing here right now.

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,084
I'm so sorry.

40
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,969
You said you would protect me.

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,087
And I will.

42
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,723
You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,529
I don't believe you anymore.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,321
I don't need you anymore.
You can't protect me.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,405
You won't even be able to protect yourself
if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,365
And why shouldn't I?

47
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,683
Do you want me to beg for my life?

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,481
If that's what you want, I will.

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,007
Whatever you ask that is in my power,
I will do.

50
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,767
What if I want you to die here and now?

51
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,444
Then I will die.

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,450
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family,

53
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,967
and you gave me to other monsters
who murdered my family.

54
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,121
Go back to Moat Cailin.

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,208
My brother and I
will take back the North on our own.

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,044
I never want to see you again.

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,683
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

58
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,451
I know that I can't.

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,123
Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish

61
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,807
has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

62
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,087
You might consider seeking him out.

63
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
The time may come
when you need an army loyal to you.

64
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,327
I have an army.

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,365
Your brother's army.

66
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,887
Half-brother.

67
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,921
You're not ready.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,849
You should go home before it's too late.

69
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,004
You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

70
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,329
She has a point.

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,602
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

72
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,411
They began as slaves in
the mines of Valyria.

73
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,206
Who was the first?

74
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,611
He was no one.

75
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,044
The Many-Faced God
taught him how to shed his face

76
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,724
and how to give the gift.

77
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,486
The man taught others
in exchange for their service.

78
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,167
Many served, many more gifts were given.

79
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,246
Soon all the masters and overseers
were gone and the Faceless Men fled.

80
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,845
Where did they go?

81
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,961
Here.

82
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,169
They founded the Free City of Braavos
and built this house.

83
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,484
These were the faces they wore in life

84
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,246
when they were not wearing others.

85
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,687
The first Faceless Men.

86
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,530
And now a girl is one of
them, if a girl desires.

87
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,640
A girl has no desires.

88
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,047
Who?

89
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,525
An actress
who calls herself Lady Crane.

90
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,167
She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

91
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,043
A girl has been given a second chance.

92
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,363
There will not be a third.

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,244
One way or another,
a face will be added to the hall.

94
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,002
Murdered by a boar.

95
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,045
The great big hairy whore.

96
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,363
He dug in his tusks, and dug out my guts,

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,922
and soon I am no more.

98
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,921
Come, Father, in bed you must lie.

99
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,251
I love you, Father. Please don't die.

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,961
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

101
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,765
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

102
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,125
And our son alone on that cold, cold throne

103
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,482
without a guiding hand.

104
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,007
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

105
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,881
To whom will he turn when it's time
to learn to look darkness in the face?

106
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,487
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now, bring me more wine.

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,366
Ooh... What's happened here, then?

108
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,968
He brought you here, Ned Stark, 'cause
you're the brightest fellow in the land.

109
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,644
You should be king of us all

110
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,929
and I should be your Hand.

111
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,164
We men of the North are right good hands
at keeping people lawful.

112
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,571
I'd ask him for permission,
but he smells too bloody awful.

113
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,601
I die. I die.

114
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,370
And here, I now must lie.

115
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,081
Oh, woe. Oh, no...

116
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,123
Oh, I am about to go.

117
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,129
Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

118
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,168
The Iron Throne's what I demand.

119
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,401
- You cannot.
- I can.

120
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,481
- You will not.
- I will.

121
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,210
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

122
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,367
The line of succession.

123
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,441
What's that mean?

124
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,284
- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?

125
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,647
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

126
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,010
So move along, give me my chair

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,969
and there won't be no more trouble.

128
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,411
But we had a deal all done and dusted.

129
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,365
I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.

130
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,044
Save my father.

131
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,488
Truly you should.
Killing the man will do you no good.

132
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,927
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

133
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,446
Show the people what a good king should be.

134
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,648
Good people, you may all relax.

135
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,802
My father's friend shall be spared the...

136
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,369
Father! No!

137
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,571
Father...

138
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,484
Worry not, all is well.

139
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,642
I have here a decree

140
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,248
from my father Tywin Lannister,
the richest man you'll see.

141
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,722
He proclaims me Hand of the King.

142
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,284
The position's mine for life.

143
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,885
And he's given me permission to take

144
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,922
Sansa as my wife.

145
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,123
You'll learn that what I lack in height,
I make up for in appetite.

146
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,410
So let's forget about your plight,
and go rehearse our wedding night.

147
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,121
It's a wart. Two warts.

148
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,964
I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

149
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,044
Well, don't worry, love.
They usually go away in five or six years.

150
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,328
Oh. Wash this, darling. It stinks of me.

151
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,483
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

152
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,404
I had two lines.

153
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,608
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

154
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,445
I rang very false?

155
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,205
What you need, love,
is for someone to ring you true.

156
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,410
You weren't
complaining about me last night.

157
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,528
May I get you
some wine, Lady Crane?

158
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,762
I'm a rum girl, Bobono.

159
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,208
You need to know that
if we're going to be intimate.

160
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,124
- Of course we're going to be intimate.
- It's only a matter of time.

161
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,565
To our children.

162
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,324
May they have your talent.

163
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,408
And your filthy mind.

164
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,726
A girl will poison the rum.

165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,643
Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

166
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,486
If a girl could use
one of the faces from the hall...

167
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,124
A girl is not ready.

168
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,243
She's a good actress.

169
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,482
So a man has heard.

170
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,484
Seems like a decent woman.

171
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,843
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

172
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,521
No.

173
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,051
Who wants her dead?

174
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,691
That does not matter. The price was paid.

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,525
The younger actress.

176
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,929
She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

177
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,524
A girl must decide
if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,885
A girl has decided.

179
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,447
A servant does not ask questions.

180
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,004
No! No! No!

181
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,605
It was you.

182
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,650
You made the White Walkers.

183
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,970
We were at war.

184
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,603
We were being slaughtered.

185
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,001
Our sacred trees cut down.

186
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,682
We needed to defend ourselves.

187
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,325
From whom?

188
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,650
From you.

189
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,886
From men.

190
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,965
We speak in the presence
of the Drowned God.

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,688
In his name we gather today
to choose a new king as our leader.

192
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,364
Who makes a claim?

193
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,802
I am Yara Greyjoy,

194
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,521
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,
King of the Iron Islands.

195
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,724
I claim the Salt Throne.

196
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,326
We've never had a queen. Not once.

197
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,324
There are many things we've never done.

198
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,971
We've never made our mark upon the world.

199
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,487
The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind

200
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,450
until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

201
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,363
long enough to become a nuisance.

202
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,442
Then they swat us down.

203
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,729
They conquer us, humiliate us,

204
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,721
and go right back to forgetting we exist.

205
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,768
Aye!

206
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,161
- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

207
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,130
- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

208
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,601
When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that...

209
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,330
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

210
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,483
Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.

211
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,086
Not when Balon's own
male heir has returned.

212
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,922
I am Theon Greyjoy,

213
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,807
last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

214
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,491
And she is your rightful ruler.

215
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,130
Aye!

216
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,761
Those of you that have sailed under her,
and there are many of you here,

217
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,487
- you know what she is.
- Aye!

218
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,449
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

219
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,204
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

220
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,725
She is ironborn!

221
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,290
Aye!

222
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,364
We will find no better leader.

223
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,768
This is our queen.

224
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,087
Yara! Yara! Yara!

225
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,527
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

226
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,687
I claim the Salt Throne.

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,650
Niece.

228
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,961
Nephew.

229
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,524
Little Theon.

230
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,290
Heard you managed to
fuck things right into the ground.

231
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,808
Captured a castle you couldn't keep.

232
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,128
Got yourself taken prisoner.

233
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,125
Even heard you have no cock.

234
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,447
Explains why you think a woman can be king.

235
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,330
- When did you return, Uncle?
- A few days ago.

236
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,207
I had some things to take care of.

237
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,850
Long overdue.

238
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,964
I'm glad you're here.

239
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,486
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

240
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,485
To execute the man who killed my father.

241
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,321
I did.

242
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,685
I killed him.

243
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,648
Threw him right over a rope bridge,
and watched him fall.

244
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,042
He was leading us nowhere,

245
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,646
and we would still be heading there
if it weren't for me.

246
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,724
No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.

247
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,724
He led us into two wars we couldn't win.

248
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,731
I apologize to you all
for not killing him years ago.

249
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,928
That would have been hard to do.

250
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,002
You weren't here.

251
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,562
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

252
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,483
"Gallivanting"?

253
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,201
That the sort of thing you start to say
once your dick gets chopped off?

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,604
Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?

255
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,443
You were gone.

256
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,090
Yara was here.

257
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,845
Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.

258
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,322
Getting ready to bring us back to glory.

259
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,765
And how will she do that?

260
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,207
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

261
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,645
Right idea,

262
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,610
except I'm the one
who's going to build the Iron Fleet

263
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,047
because I'm the one who
knows how to use it.

264
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,610
I've been all over the world.

265
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,724
I've seen more of it than
all of you combined.

266
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,005
And across the sea there is a person

267
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,846
who hates the great lords of Westeros
just as much as we do.

268
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,363
Someone with a large army,

269
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,727
three large dragons,

270
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,801
and no husband.

271
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,882
I'm going to build that fleet

272
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,201
and I'm going to gallivant right over

273
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,841
And give it to Daenerys Targaryen
along with my big cock.

274
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,929
You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?

275
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,288
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

276
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,170
And together
we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.

277
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,924
I wasn't born to be king.

278
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,691
I paid the iron price, and here I stand.

279
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,241
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

280
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,245
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

281
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,004
Euron! Euron!

282
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,291
May Euron, your servant,
be born again from the sea as you were.

283
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,609
Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone.

284
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,444
Bless him with steel.

285
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,205
Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.

286
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,491
He is speaking to us and he says,

287
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,600
"We shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy."

288
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,843
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

289
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,810
Let the old Euron drown.

290
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,725
Let his lungs fill with seawater.

291
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,009
Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

292
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,526
What is dead may never die.

293
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,082
But rises again harder and stronger.

294
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,851
What is dead may never die.

295
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,487
What is dead may never die.

296
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,601
Where are my niece and nephew?

297
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,284
Let's go murder them.

298
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,728
They stole our best ships.

299
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,044
Won't be enough to save them.

300
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,287
Go back to your homes.

301
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,647
Chop down every tree you can find.

302
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,371
Quarter-saw the timber and start building.

303
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,442
I want every man bending planks.

304
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,683
I want every woman spinning flax for sails.

305
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,606
Build me 1,000 ships.

306
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,365
And I will give you this world.

307
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,801
I banished you, twice.

308
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,685
You came back, twice.

309
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,290
And you saved my life.

310
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,208
So I can't take you back,

311
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,123
and I can't send you away.

312
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,642
You must send me away.

313
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,445
Is there a cure?

314
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,851
I don't know.

315
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,845
How long does it take?

316
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,728
I don't know that either.

317
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,201
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

318
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,971
I'll end things before that.

319
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,690
I'm sorry.

320
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,442
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

321
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,807
All I've ever wanted was to serve you.

322
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,966
Tyrion Lannister was right.

323
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,728
I love you.

324
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,484
I'll always love you.

325
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,721
Goodbye, Khaleesi.

326
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,009
Do not walk away from your queen,
Jorah the Andal.

327
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,521
You have not been dismissed.

328
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,640
You pledged yourself to me.

329
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,411
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

330
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,041
Well, I command you to find the cure,

331
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,171
wherever it is in this world.

332
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,801
I command you to heal yourself,

333
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,685
and then return to me.

334
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,002
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

335
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,169
I need you by my side.

336
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,961
In the last fortnight
since our pact with the Masters,

337
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,482
how many killings have been carried out
by the Sons of the Harpy?

338
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,641
None.

339
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,883
And how many Masters have been butchered
by the free men?

340
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,327
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

341
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,124
Since then, nothing.

342
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,488
So, it's safe to say
that a fragile peace has taken hold.

343
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,686
For now.

344
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,808
"For now" is the best
we get in our profession.

345
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,086
It's not enough.

346
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,083
Considering the city
was on the brink of civil war,

347
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,128
I'd say it's a good start.

348
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,441
It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.

349
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,247
They need to know
Daenerys is responsible for it.

350
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,001
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

351
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,321
Resist the foreign invaders.

352
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,562
Our queen has an even better story.

353
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,168
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains, all that.

354
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,842
The people know who brought them freedom.

355
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,446
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

356
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,443
Who brought about an end to the violence?

357
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,167
We need someone the people trust,

358
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,444
someone they know
cannot be bought or influenced.

359
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,845
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

360
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,241
Who said anything about "him"?

361
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,526
You stand in the presence of Kinvara,

362
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,450
High Priestess of the
Red Temple of Volantis,

363
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,126
the Flame of Truth,

364
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,611
the Light of Wisdom,

365
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,481
the First Servant of the Lord of Light.

366
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,167
Welcome to Meereen.

367
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,321
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

368
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,691
Thank you for traveling all this way.

369
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,446
I know from personal experience
how uncomfortable the journey can be.

370
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,927
The truth is we need your help.

371
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,450
We had hoped that
we could somehow persuade you to...

372
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,602
You don't need to persuade me.

373
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,966
I came to help.

374
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,168
Daenerys Stormborn
is the one who was promised.

375
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,608
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

376
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,129
Yes.

377
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,683
She has freed the slaves from their chains
and crucified the Masters for their sins.

378
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,370
She did indeed.

379
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,410
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

380
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,482
a gift from the Lord of Light.

381
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,201
But you heard all of this
before, haven't you?

382
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,723
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

383
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,527
The dragons will purify nonbelievers
by the thousands,

384
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,046
burning their sins and flesh away.

385
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,090
Ideally we'd avoid
purifying too many nonbelievers.

386
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,970
The Mother of Dragons
has followers of many different faiths.

387
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,487
You want your queen
to be worshipped and obeyed.

388
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,770
And while she's gone, you want her advisors
to be worshipped and obeyed.

389
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,281
I'd settle for obeyed.

390
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,250
I will summon
my most eloquent priests.

391
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,130
They will spread the word.

392
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,687
Daenerys has been sent
to lead the people against the darkness

393
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,765
in this war, and in the
great war still to come.

394
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,480
That sounds most excellent.

395
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,604
A man named
Stannis Baratheon was anointed

396
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,570
as the chosen one by one
of your priestesses.

397
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,405
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

398
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,250
He attacked King's Landing

399
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,887
and was soundly defeated
by the man standing beside me.

400
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,486
Last I had heard, he had
been defeated again,

401
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,645
this time at Winterfell,
and this time for good.

402
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,849
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

403
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,611
I suppose it's hard
for a fanatic to admit a mistake.

404
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,529
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

405
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,887
You're always right.

406
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,440
Everything is the Lord's will.

407
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,490
Everything is the Lord's will.

408
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,570
But men and women make mistakes.

409
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,324
Even honest servants of the Lord.

410
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,486
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

411
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,009
why should I trust you to know any more
than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

412
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,243
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

413
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,721
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

414
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,286
Everyone is what they are,

415
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,002
and where they are for a reason.

416
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,090
Terrible things happen for a reason.

417
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,650
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

418
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,285
If not for your mutilation
at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

419
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,364
you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen

420
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,244
bring his light into the world.

421
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,162
Knowledge has made you powerful.

422
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,167
But there's still so much you don't know.

423
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,769
Do you remember what you heard that night

424
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,208
when the sorcerer
tossed your parts in the fire?

425
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,647
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

426
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,681
Should I tell you what the voice said?

427
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,562
Should I tell you
the name of the one who spoke?

428
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,403
We serve the same queen.

429
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,324
If you are her true friend,
you have nothing to fear from me.

430
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,642
He saw me, the Night King!

431
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,768
- He saw me!
- He touched you.

432
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,369
I don't know. He was close, but...

433
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,601
He touched you.

434
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,529
He knows you are here. He'll come for you.

435
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,601
But he can't get in.

436
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,368
He can now. His mark is on you.

437
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,130
You must leave, all of you.

438
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,891
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

439
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,961
Hodor.

440
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,204
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

441
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

442
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,248
For you to become me.

443
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,484
But am I ready?

444
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,481
No.

445
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,846
We can't defend the North from
the Walkers and the south from the Boltons.

446
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,211
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell,
and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

447
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,931
Aside from
the Starks and the Boltons,

448
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,844
the most powerful houses in the North

449
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,402
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,
and the Manderlys.

450
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,371
The Umbers and the Karstarks

451
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,927
have already declared for the Boltons,
so we're not doing so well there.

452
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,844
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

453
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,729
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
without knowing they had another choice.

454
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,121
Uh, I beg your pardon, my lady,

455
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,409
but they know that
a Stark beheaded their father.

456
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
I don't think we can count on them either.

457
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,846
How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

458
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,251
Precious little, my lady.

459
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,766
My father always said
Northerners are different.

460
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,442
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

461
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,124
They may well be loyal,

462
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,886
but how many rose up against the Boltons
when they betrayed your family?

463
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,846
I may not know the North, but I know men.

464
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,608
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

465
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,762
and even the bravest of them

466
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,124
don't want to see their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

467
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,611
If Jon's going to convince them
to fight alongside him,

468
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,648
they need to believe it's
a fight they can win.

469
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,008
There are more than three other houses
in the North,

470
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,768
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.

471
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,006
Two dozen more.

472
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,401
Together they equal all the others.

473
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,324
We can start small and build.

474
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,241
The North remembers.

475
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,480
They remember the Stark name.

476
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,690
People will still risk everything for it,
from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

477
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,929
I don't doubt it.

478
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,204
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

479
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,645
No, but I do.

480
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,442
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

481
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,008
And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,

482
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,924
but they will back us
against the Boltons without question.

483
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,843
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

484
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,764
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it
and retaken Riverrun.

485
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,201
How do you know that?

486
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,330
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

487
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,445
That's good.

488
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,128
The Blackfish is a legend.
His support would mean a great deal.

489
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,011
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

490
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,323
almost starts to look like a winning side.

491
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,763
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

492
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,606
You heard them. We need more men,
and my uncle has an army.

493
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,125
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

494
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,162
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
It has to be you.

495
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,241
Ride for Riverrun.

496
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,642
My uncle will talk to you
and you'll know how to talk to him.

497
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,207
What is it?

498
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,089
I don't like leaving you here alone.

499
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,491
With Jon?

500
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,404
Not him. He seems trustworthy.

501
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,642
A bit brooding, perhaps.

502
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,569
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

503
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,685
The others, though.

504
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,491
Davos and the Red Woman
helped a man murder his own brother

505
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,766
with blood magic.

506
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,731
And when Stannis paid for his crime,
where were they?

507
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,844
Already out looking
for a leader with better prospects.

508
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,122
And that wildling fellow with the beard...

509
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,685
Jon isn't Tormund.

510
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,764
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman,
or Stannis for that matter.

511
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,922
Jon is Jon.

512
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,203
He's my brother.
He'll keep me safe. I trust him.

513
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,481
Then why did you lie to him

514
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,642
when he asked you
how you learned about Riverrun?

515
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,565
New dress?

516
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,209
I made it myself. Do you like it?

517
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,010
Yeah, it's...

518
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,567
I like the wolf bit.

519
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,640
Good, because I made this for you.

520
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,727
I made it like the one Father used to wear.

521
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,446
As near as I can remember.

522
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,160
Thank you, Sansa.

523
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,444
You're welcome.

524
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,688
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

525
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,762
I'll do my best.

526
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,925
Good luck.

527
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,922
Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?

528
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,082
I'm not the Lord...

529
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,365
Yeah,

530
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,328
close the bloody gate.

531
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,331
We can go home now, Hodor.

532
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,290
Well, maybe not home, home,
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

533
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,127
Hodor.

534
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,288
Eat something that isn't moss.

535
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,682
I want an egg. How do you like 'em?

536
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,607
Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

537
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,523
Hodor.

538
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,051
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

539
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,246
Hodor.

540
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,564
Get Bran and run!

541
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,889
Bran. Bran, wake up.

542
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,881
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

543
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,605
Bran, wake up!

544
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,126
Take him to the Vale.

545
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,400
- Gods keep you on the King's Road.
- Take it easy.

546
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,441
Watch yourself.

547
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,965
- Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

548
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,601
Help me!

549
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,641
Go!

550
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,481
Go!

551
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,209
Remember that you are a Stark.

552
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,722
Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale

553
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,125
and try to stay out of fights.

554
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,531
Yes, Father.

555
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,251
But if you have to fight,

556
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,001
win.

557
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,088
Bran! Bran, wake up!

558
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,091
Bran! Bran, wake up.

559
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,367
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

560
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,287
You have to wake up.

561
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,442
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

562
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,601
Bran, we need Hodor.

563
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,562
Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.

564
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,090
Hodor. Hodor.

565
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,360
Bran, we're all going to die!

566
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,251
Bran, wake up!

567
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,007
We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!

568
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,809
Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.

569
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,524
Hodor. Hodor.

570
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,681
Warg into Hodor now!

571
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,449
Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.

572
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,125
We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now. Now!

573
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,124
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

574
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,568
Hodor. Hodor.

575
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,244
Hodor. Hodor.

576
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,885
Hodor. Hodor.

577
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,484
- Summer!
- Go.

578
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,680
Go!

579
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,889
The time has come.

580
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,650
Leave me.

581
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,969
- What are you doing?
- Go!

582
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,486
Hodor, hurry.

583
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,281
Hodor.

584
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,805
Hold the door!

585
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,484
Hold the door!

586
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,810
Hold the door!

587
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,651
Hold the door!

588
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,161
Hold the door!

589
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,851
- Hold the door!
- Wylis?

590
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,806
What's the matter?

591
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,201
- Hold the door!
- Come on, son.

592
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,410
Hold the door!

593
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:25,363
Hold the door! Hold the door!

594
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,490
Hold the door!

595
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,531
Hold the door!

596
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,881
Hold the door! Hold the door!

597
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Hold the door! Hold the door!

598
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,411
Hold the door! Hold door!

599
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,731
Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door!

600
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,646
Hold door! Hodor!

601
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,927
Hodor! Hodor!

602
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,206
Hodor. Hodor.

603
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,441
Hodor.
