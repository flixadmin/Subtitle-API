you just passed,

168
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,295
and Tigress told me.

169
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:06,297
Yeah, well, did she also
tell you that it'll
never happen again?

170
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,424
Because I'm done.

171
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:09,592
Teaching or being humiliated?

172
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,512
Both! I don't know
why you ever thought
I could teach that class.

173
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:14,305
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

174
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:17,434
What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

175
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,561
If you only do
what you can do,

176
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,397
you will never be
more than you are now.

177
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:25,316
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

178
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,153
You don't even know
who you are.

179
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,738
What do you...
Of course I do.

180
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,448
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

181
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,367
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

182
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:37,787
Hmm.

183
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:41,166
It means, you know,
just going around

184
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,542
and punching and kicking.

185
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,336
Defending the Valley!
And stuff.

186
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,921
Punching and kicking?

187
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,256
You think that is what

188
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,341
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

189
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,304
A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

190
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,973
so you could
spend your days
kicking butt

191
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,851
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

192
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,895
Yes?
No!

(SIGHS)

194
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,648
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

195
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,734
Against my better judgment.

196
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,695
More than you can see
in yourself.

197
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,573
Incredible power awaits you.

198
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,912
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

199
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,513
Wow! What was that?

200
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,972
That was chi.

201
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,307
Wow!

202
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:40,809
What's chi?

203
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:45,647
The energy that flows
through all living things.

204
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,899
So you're saying
if I teach,

205
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,192
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

206
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,486
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

207
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,488
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

208
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,572
Oh.

209
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,159
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

210
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,203
Oogway sat alone in a cave

211
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,957
for 30 years
asking one question.

212

"Who am I?"

213
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:07,836
"Who am I?"

214
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,754
I'm lucky if
I get five minutes

215
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,214
before you interrupt...
(PO GROANS)

216
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,716
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

217
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:14,843
Eventually.

218
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,511
After you master teaching.

219
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:19,848
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

220
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,975
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

turn you into you.

Turn me into me?

223
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,569
Wait a second,
that makes no...

224
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,778
Almost there, Shifu.

225
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:37,115
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.
