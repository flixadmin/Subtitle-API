1
00:00:00,478 --> 00:00:02,524
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:06,624
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:08,742
to survive.

4
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:10,544
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:12,663
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:14,865
to use the list of names
he left me

7
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:18,803
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:22,273
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:26,127
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,362
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,775
You told me to stay away
from your family and I did.

12
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:32,525
But your family isn't
staying away from me.

13
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,944
Which means something
must be done about it.

14
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,397
Where can I find the man
in this picture?

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,866
Do you not think it convenient
you captured me so easily?

16
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,735
Run!

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,991
Uhh! Uhh!

18
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,697
Do you even know
what this island really is?

19
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,583
It's a prison.

20
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:59,869
What would you do
in my position?

21
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:10,880
♪ Yes, sir
♪ yeah, yeah

22
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:12,916
♪ yes, sir
♪ yeah, yeah

23
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:16,019
Whatever you're
listening to, it ain't music.

24
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,245
They're ought
to be a law.

25
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,779
Well, there's not.

26
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,703
Watch it!

27
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,912
Back up! Get out of here!

28
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:19,816
Tahitian green
or midnight black--

29
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:21,201
what do you think?

30
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:22,836
I think that you've been
dropping hints all week, Thea,

31
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,671
and mom still isn't buying you
a car for your birthday.

32
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,206
I could not have said it
better myself.

33
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,041
Oliver got a car
when he turned 18.

34
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:30,760
Yeah, but I could back it
out of the driveway

35
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,178
without hitting a tree.

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,513
That's true.
But I do remember you

37
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,181
taking the paint off
the side of your dad's Maserati.

38
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,634
Yeah, the party planner's
waiting.

39
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,519
Sorry to run off like this.

40
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,671
Don't we have
a convertible to go buy?

41
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:43,139
Good luck.

42
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,775
How's she holding up?

43
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,944
Oh, she's okay.

44
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:50,614
Thea thinks she's actually
a little bit too okay.

45
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:51,648
What do you mean?

46
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,883
Just...
behaving erratically.

47
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:56,069
Shut-in one minute, running
the company the next.

48
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,039
Well, her husband is missing
and presumed who-knows-what.

49
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,241
If anyone had an excuse
to be erratic,

50
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:02,375
it's your mom.

51
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:03,493
That's what I told Thea.

52
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,078
...he's too busy
to comment.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,347
The department has got
the same comment about this heist

54
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,749
as it did the other two.
No comment.

55
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,469
The SCPD may not be willing
to go on the record,

56
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:15,939
but traffic cameras got the
entire heist in this exclusive.

57
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,602
<i>Shortly after 1 a.m., three masked robbers</i>
<i>approached the armored vehicle,</i>

58
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:21,228
<i>after launching</i>
<i>what appears to be...</i>

59
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,129
That's why you keep
all your money offshore.

60
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:26,381
<i>forced the guards outside. One of the</i>
<i>guards was prounced dead on the scene.</i>

61
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,816
<i>While the other died on route</i>
<i>to Starling General...</i>

62
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,124
<i>Their identites have</i>
<i>not yet been released.</i>

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,408
With all the guys
working up top,

64
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,079
you might want to think
about a side entrance for your, uh,

65
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,563
Arrowcave.

66
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,867
Just put one in.
South alleyway.

67
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,252
Something
I want to show you.

68
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,505
Finally getting into
online dating

69
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,573
and you need help
with your profile.

70
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:53,409
Not exactly. But there is
somebody I'd like to meet.

71
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,949
Yeah, I read about it.

72
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,734
This is the third truck
to be hit this month.

73
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,100
I saw it on the news
this morning.

74
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:01,731
I couldn't figure out
why it seemed so familiar.

75
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,756
Then I remembered this.

76
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,974
Kandahar, '09, when the Marines
took out a Taliban transport vehicle.

77
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:11,695
Yeah. Well, there's a reason
why it looks so similar.

78
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:14,230
These guys are running the same
swarming technique. Where'd you find this?

79
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,463
I was researching someone.

80
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,514
Bodyguard who works for
a private security firm.

81
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:21,705
Blackhawk squad protection group.
His name is Ted Gaynor.

82
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:24,240
Oliver, Ted Gaynor
was my commanding officer

83
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:26,376
on my first tour
in Afghanistan.

84
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,249
Dig...I'm sorry.

85
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,637
Gaynor's on the list.

86
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,674
Gaynor's a few hundred thousand
dollars short of making your list.

87
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,559
Well, I never said it was
just one-percenters, did I?

88
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,261
Oliver, this guy
saved my life.

89
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:47,564
Received
a commendation for it.

90
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:50,850
I don't care what your book
says. He's not a stick-up man.

91
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,852
You haven't known him
in a long time, Diggle.

92
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,522
We both kept in contact with
each other since we got stateside.

93
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:58,241
6 months ago he even
offered me a job at Blackhawk.

94
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:00,660
Now, trust me, you don't
know this man like I do.

95
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,163
I know in Afghanistan
his training specialty

96
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:04,998
was M-32 multiple
grenade launchers,

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,250
the exact same weapon
used in these heists

98
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,835
and not exactly
something that you find

99
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,486
at your local
sporting goods store.

100
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:12,539
Two months ago,
we found out

101
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,157
this wasn't even
your father's book,

102
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,176
that it was written by whoever
hired the other archer.

103
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,627
Doesn't that kind of
beg the question

104
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,212
what else you could
be wrong about?

105
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,897
I could be wrong.

106
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,298
But the list isn't.

107
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,868
Now, I'm gonna have
a pointed conversation

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,457
with Mr. Gaynor tonight.

109
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,114
We'll see what he has
to say about it.

110
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,592
I understand if you want
to take the week off.

111
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,412
Well, thank you.

112
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,314
Sir.

113
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,712
Different day, same slop.

114
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:44,080
You new?

115
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,298
Yeah.

116
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,051
Don't worry.
It took me a year

117
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,553
to find my way
around the island.

118
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,222
Oh, hey, hey. Hey.

119
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:56,893
I'm supposed to be
transporting a prisoner.

120
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,629
A Chinese guy
who wears a green hood.

121
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,764
Sounds like the guy they took
to the east camp.

122
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,734
I'm heading over that way. Come on.
You can hitch a ride.

123
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,036
Let's go. Come on.

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,382
Hold up! Hold up!

125
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,784
Units one, two.

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,819
That wall over there still has
to be taped and textured.

127
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:42,155
I need you to to grout
the hallway floor

128
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,574
as soon as they are done
with the tile install.

129
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:47,977
All right.

130
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,330
Yeah?
Hey, Tommy.

131
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,698
Dad, I am really busy.

132
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,499
Tommy, I know things
have been, well,

133
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,335
strained between us since...

134
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:58,171
Since you cut me off
and told me that I was a loser?

135
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,990
I was just trying
to jolt you into adulthood.

136
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,927
And look at you now.
You've got your first job.

137
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,262
My tough love worked.

138
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:07,931
What do you want, Dad?

139
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:11,467
Nothing more than
to share a meal with my son.

140
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,353
Dinner tomorrow night?

141
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,837
Laurel and I have plans.

142
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,172
Bring her along.
I think it's time

143
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,640
I got to know her
a little better.

144
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,894
Tommy...

145
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:23,730
I've said some pretty
hurtful things,

146
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:24,781
and I regret them.

147
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,066
But you're still my son.

148
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:31,154
And I still want
what I've always wanted.

149
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:34,407
For us to be close.

150
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:39,162
Let me check with Laurel
and I'll get back to you.

151
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,247
Uhh!

152
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,699
Ted Gaynor, we're gonna
have a conversation.

153
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:19,369
You make a move,
go for a gun, anything,

154
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,204
things will end
badly for you.

155
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,041
Put the bow down.

156

It's all clear.

159
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:57,327
You okay?

160
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,545
Uh...

161
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,463
Yeah.

162
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,465
Well, I gotta talk
to my boss,

163
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,802
but after...
what I just saw,

164
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,171
I'd say you're
as good as hired.

165
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,306
Hell of a job interview, Ted.

166
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:13,426
Usually the Vigilante
only goes after rich schmucks.

167
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:16,513
Any reason why he would
change his M.O. for you?

168
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,401
You've known me
a long time, John.

169
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,554
What do you think?

170
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,827
That he made a mistake.

171
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:34,697
Got the wrong guy.

172
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:39,836
I could've shot you.
I could've killed you.

173
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,421
What the hell
were you thinking?!

174
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,206
I'm not gonna let you
William Tell an innocent man.

175
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,958
Gaynor isn't innocent,
Diggle.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,010
You seem to think that mainly because
of what's in you're damn book,

177
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,962
which you apparently trust
more than you trust me.

178
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,797
I trust my father.

179
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,883
And he explained to me
that every name on that list

180
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,351
has a reason to be there.

181
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,020
I thought you took that book
off your father's dead body.

182
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,638
How can he have been
so chatty?

183
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:03,726
A few years ago,
I found a message he left me

184
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,278
explaining the list.

185
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,779
Oliver,
how is that possible?

186
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,114
You were on
a deserted island.

187
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:11,234
I didn't say that
I found it on the island.

188
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:14,370
Diggle, for the past
4 months,

189
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:17,373
I have lied to,
hurt, and hid things

190
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,742
from all the people
that I care about.

191
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:22,829
Do you really think that
I would do all of this

192
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,048
if I wasn't sure?

193
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,840
Oliver, listen. Gaynor
got me into Blackhawk,

194
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:36,392
and I'm gonna prove
he's innocent.

195
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,228
And if he isn't?

196
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,064
If he's not, I'll be the one
to take him down myself.

197
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,299
You owe me that.

198
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,736
You owe me at least that.

199
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,195
Were you stationed
by the perimeter?

200
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,814
Yes.
And your report?

201
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,668
Uh, everything's good, sir.
No trouble.

202
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,670
How long have you
been stationed here?

203
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,755
Just arrived, sir.

204
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,508
Yes, you do seem
rather green.

205
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:11,994
Although I don't recall
the submarine

206
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,431
bringing in a phalanx
of new troops lately.

207
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:23,189
Submarine? I thought everybody
came into the island on the plane.

208
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,860
Indeed they do.

209
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,234
I think you've tried on
every dress in the city.

210
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,736
It's so gonna be worth it.

211
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,454
My friends are gonna freak.

212
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:41,824
Yes, well, if your father were
still alive, he'd freak, too.

213
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,459
Though in an entirely
different way.

214
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:47,380
Like when he saw what I was wearing
to my first boy-girl dance.

215
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,749
That poor boy
you went with.

216
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,801
Oh, Robert scared him
to death.

217
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,720
You know, dad used to say

218
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,557
his saddest day would be
when I turned 18.

219
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,844
Now he's gone
and I'm the one that's sad.

220
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,984
Sorry.

221
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,522
I need to take this.

222
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,240
Hello.

223
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:19,162
Yes, I understand,
but I'm with my daughter.

224
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,283
All right.
I'll be there.

225
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:29,839
I thought you said we were gonna
spend the whole day together.

226
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,457
I know.

227
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,292
But, uh,

228
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,912
compliance needs
to file the 8k

229
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,848
connected to my assuming
Walter's position in the company

230
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,216
and they can't wait.

231
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:44,687
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,690
Is everything okay?

233
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,475
You look worried.

234
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,478
Not worried, just...

235
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,532
My father called.

236
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,868
Oh.

237
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,620
And how did that go?

238
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,272
He invited us to dinner
for tonight.

239
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:04,273
Oh.

240
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,408
Yeah.

241
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,942
Apparently he wants
to mend some fences,

242
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,445
but thanks to him,
I can't afford a fence,

243
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,048
so I can only assume
he's got some other agenda.

244
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,167
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

245
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,171
Maybe he really is trying
to extend an olive branch.

246
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:23,426
You really do look for the
best in people, don't you?

247
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,311
Lucky for you.

248
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,072
I'm sorry to have to pull you
away from your family like that.

249
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,323
What do you want, Malcolm?

250
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:39,692
We have a problem with
your friend Carl Ballard.

251
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:42,578
He's trying to gentrify
the Glades.

252
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,315
Carl knows that's not
part of the plan.

253
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,818
Which is why you're
gonna shut him down.

254
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,953
You're his friend.
He'll listen to you.

255
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,507
If you want me
to help you with Carl,

256
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,843
I want something in return.

257
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:00,430
Proof Walter's still alive.

258
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,616
My word isn't enough?

259
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:06,352
What's that saying--

260
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,838
"trust but verify"?

261
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,509
Words to live by.

262
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:28,074
Two days later, I am still digging
regurgitated tacos

263
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:31,911
out of the car vents and he asks
me why I won't turn on the A/C.

264
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,996
All right, you win.

265
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,915
Bodyguarding Queen
was never that bad.

266
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,334
6 years serving my country,
the only thing I'm qualified for

267
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,253
is babysitting spoiled brats.

268
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,138
Well, Ted, they're
not all like that.

269
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,174
I haven't met one yet that would
survive a single day in country.

270
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,894
Sometimes it makes me wonder
what I was doing over there.

271
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,812
Specialty of the house.

272
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,814
Thank you, Carly.

273
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,549
No.
Where is my cake?

274
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,984
Tired of listening
to you complain

275
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,319
about the dry cleaners
shrinking your suit.

276
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,603
Oh, yeah.

277
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,855
Mm.

278
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,993
She likes you.

279
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,862
She's my sister-in-law,
Ted.

280
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,146
Not anymore.

281
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:10,249
Your brother's gone, John.

282
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:13,019
But you are here.

283
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,573
Car's waiting outside.
Got a client to drop off

284
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,675
at the Chaykin
Art Gallery opening.

285
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,410
John, you remember
Paul Knox?

286
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:24,580
He was a couple of ranks
under us back in the 'Stan.

287
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,217
Good to be working with you.

288
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,773
I'll be outside.

289
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,428
I didn't know Knox
worked at Blackhawk.

290
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,149
They recruited him when his
tour ended last month.

291
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:44,483
Mm-hmm.

292
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,986
People change, John.

293
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:49,322
And everyone deserves
a chance to prove it.

294
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,425
Knocking is not
just a suggestion.

295
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:10,927
I need to talk to you.

296
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:15,565
Thea, I'm not telling you
if mom's getting you a car.

297
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,650
It's not about that.

298
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,102
Remember last week
when I asked you

299
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,104
if you thought mom
was acting weird?

300
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,639
Yeah.

301
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,775
Well, I found out why.

302
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:28,194
She's hooking up
with Tommy's dad.

303
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,112
That's insane.

304
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:33,366
I just saw them
together.

305
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,534
It's happening
all over again.

306
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,169
What are you talking about?

307
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:47,630
A couple of months before you
and dad left on the "Gambit,"

308
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,849
mom and dad
were arguing a lot.

309
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:50,850
About what?

310
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,134
I don't know.

311
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,136
But she was having
a lot of these...

312
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:57,523
lunch meetings
with Mr. Merlyn.

313
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:00,860
And now Walter's gone, too,
and mom and Mr. Merlyn

314
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,112
are back at it.
It's gross.

315
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:06,616
Mom never would have
cheated on dad.

316
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,085
She's not cheating on Walter.

317
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,371
You don't want to believe it

318
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:16,225
because you have this perfect image
of mom in your head.

319
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:19,211
That's not who she is,
Ollie.

320
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,297
She's a liar

321
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,999
and a cheater.

322
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:27,169
And you really
don't know her at all.

323
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,959
She thinks Malcolm and I
are having an affair?

324
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,277
And that it started
back when dad was still alive.

325
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,412
Why would she think that?

326
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:50,164
She says you and dad
were fighting.

327
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,283
Mom...

328
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,085
It's not your concern,
sweetheart.

329
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,571
Thea made it my concern.

330
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:03,310
What was going on?

331
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:15,239
Robert was unfaithful
to me repeatedly.

332
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:21,361
It made our marriage
difficult, to say the least.

333
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,397
I'm sorry, Oliver,
but your father

334
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,282
wasn't always the man
you thought he was.

335
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:28,702
I know you thought
he walked on water,

336
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:31,655
but, you see, that how I wanted you
to remember him--

337
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:33,791
as a good man
who loved you.

338
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:36,226
That's how I want Thea
to remember him.

339
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:40,130
So promise me
you'll keep it a secret.

340
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,300
Of course.

341
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,271
Mom.

342
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,139
Yes?

343
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:51,441
Why would Thea think
that you and Mr. Merlyn

344
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:52,843
are still sneaking around?

345
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:56,830
Well, I can't imagine.

346
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:01,285
Have you seen him lately?

347
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,204
Oliver...

348
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:08,292
He's been the CEO of Merlyn Global Group
for years.

349
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,495
I've been running
Queen Consolidated mere weeks.

350
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:15,682
Yes, I occasionally
go and ask for advice.

351
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:21,205
Is my interrogation over?

352
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:42,058
See, this is where we, uh,

353
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,079
detain prisoners
prone to running off

354
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:48,248
before I've finished with them.

355
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,033
Uhh!

356
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:02,679
Prisoners like you,
Mr. Queen.

357
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:10,270
At Christmas one year,

358
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,255
Tommy wanted a puppy.

359
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:15,025
He wanted to name it
Arthur,

360
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:18,094
as in King Arthur,
because he's a Merlyn.

361
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:20,781
Well, you used to be
so incredibly adorable.

362
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:21,782
I still am.

363
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:25,652
My wife would have
liked you, Laurel.

364
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:28,322
I wish I would have
known her.

365
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,540
She passed away before
Tommy and I became friends.

366
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:34,444
She was killed, Laurel.
There's no need to be polite about it.

367
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:36,279
You're just a ray of sunshine
today, aren't you, Dad?

368
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:39,616
Please forgive me.
Talking about my wife has a tendency

369
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:42,419
to make me a little bit
maudlin.

370
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:52,012
And here I was beginning
to think my days of being

371
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,064
Oliver Queen's personal
computer geek were coming to an end.

372
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,732
Is that your way
of saying you miss me?

373
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,802
No. But if it works
for you, go with it.

374
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:01,304
Heh. So a friend of mine
is running a scavenger hunt,

375
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:05,325
and there's a case of
Lafite Rothschild 1982 waiting at the end.

376
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:06,860
Oh...I love red wine.

377
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:08,578
But in order to find it,

378
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,615
I first need to get
through this.

379
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,618
Hmm. Security fob.

380
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:26,463
It's pin protected.

381
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:27,998
Challenge response goes back
to a company called

382
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,300
Blackhawk Squad
Protection Group.

383
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,636
Yeah, my friend had
his bodyguard set it up for him.

384
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:35,389
Personally, however,
I think it's cheating. But whatever.

385
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:39,109
This is a military-grade
cryptographic security protocol.

386
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:42,112
Your friend really
went to all this trouble?

387
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,864
The idle rich
are hard to entertain.

388
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,782
Listen...

389
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:50,320
You get through it and one
of those bottles of wine is yours.

390
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,802
This been lovely,
Mr. Merlyn. Thank you.

391
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,421
Thank you for joining me.

392
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,140
It's been wonderful
getting to know you better.

393
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:13,677
And if Tommy doesn't mind me
mixing a little business with pleasure,

394
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,396
I could use your signature
on these.

395
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,028
You want to shut down
mom's free clinic?

396
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,496
It's not hers anymore,
Tommy.

397
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,748
That clinic meant
everything to mom.

398
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,900
You were 8 years old.
I don't think you were in a position

399
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:39,369
to know what was important
to your mother.

400
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,637
I just need your signature--

401
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,755
Stop.

402
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,440
This dinner

403
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:45,792
was never about
getting to know Laurel.

404
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,410
It was about this.

405
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,191
You haven't changed
and you never will.

406
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:05,145
It's about time
that I learned that

407
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,597
and stopped letting you
disappoint me.

408
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,366
We're leaving.

409
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,271
This clinic
was his mother's.

410
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:16,990
Yes.

411
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:19,576
And his mother taught him a lesson
I've been trying to,

412
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:22,278
that the world is a harsh
and unforgiving place.

413
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,114
And when did she
teach him that?

414
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:30,253
When she was lying dead
in the street

415
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:31,955
with a bullet in her head.

416
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,642
Good night.

417
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:43,767
Management keeps things
running smooth, which is nice.

418
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,436
Better than going to war
with the army you got, right?

419
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:47,854
Indeed.

420
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:49,406
Indeed.

421
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,776
So, Ted, are you the reason Knox is
working for Blackhawk?

422
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:56,446
Look, I know you don't
like the guy.

423
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,448
I wasn't his biggest fan,
either,

424
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,785
but jobs are hard to come by
for everybody these days.

425
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,837
And guys like us,

426
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,490
when all anyone thinks you're
qualified for is shooting at people--

427
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:09,342
if I hadn't gotten Knox
this job,

428
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:12,262
chances are he'd be out
knocking over liquor stores

429
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:14,131
or robbing banks.

430
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,055
What did you get?

431
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,808
I think your friend's bodyguard
gave him the wrong security fob.

432
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,193
Why is that?

433
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,562
Well, once I got past
Blackhawk's authentication system,

434
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:31,114
there wasn't anything
about a scavenger hunt.

435
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,983
Just a directory and...

436
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:34,901
Well, I think
you stumbled onto,

437
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:38,822
or got me to stumble onto
something pretty illegal.

438
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:40,073
Define illegal.

439
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,909
Oh, you know.
Robbing an armored car

440
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:44,327
with grenade launchers
and tear gas.

441
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:46,296
What?
Someone at Blackhawk

442
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,748
was using their system to store
detailed routes and schedules

443
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,367
for each of the city's
7 major armored car carriers,

444
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:53,053
including the 3
that have already been hit.

445
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:56,256
Mr. Queen, I think we should
provide this information to the police.

446
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:58,475
With it, they should be able
to predict the next heist.

447
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:01,845
Hold on. Felicity, I don't want
to get you in trouble with my friend,

448
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,598
so do me a favor.
Forward that directory on to me

449
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,650
and I'll get it
to the police personally.

450
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,019
Thank you.

451
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,889
So, no wine, then?

452
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:11,447
Uhh! Uhh!

453
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:13,416
Knox, he's hurt!

454
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:19,289
Let's go! Let's go!

455
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:46,214
Aah! Oh, God, check it out!
Check it out! Convertible.

456
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,283
You must be so surprised.

457
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:51,002
Oh, isn't everything
absolutely perfect?

458
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,638
Except for
dad were here.

459
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,473
If dad were here,

460
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:58,310
he'd say you look
beautiful.

461
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,630
Oh! Excuse me a sec.

462
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,656
I heard the Hood foiled
an armored car heist this evening.

463
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,474
Gaynor wasn't running
the rocket launcher.

464
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,476
I know. I was with him
the whole time it was going down.

465
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,196
It looks like
you were right.

466
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,165
Listen, if someone
at Blackhawk is involved,

467
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,783
I'd put my money on Knox.

468
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,251
He started right before
the heists began,

469
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,452
and he has military
training.

470
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,338
Okay. I injured one.

471
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,923
He was bleeding pretty badly
when they made off in their van.

472
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:32,460
Okay, so if any of Knox's
blood is in one of the motor pool vans,

473
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,045
I'm going with you.
We'll know for sure.

474
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,214
No, no, no, listen.
You have this party.

475
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,999
And I told you
I would handle this.

476
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,101
If there's any problems,
you're just a phone call away.

477
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,970
Hey.

478
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,672
Head on a swivel.

479
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:48,276
That's the way
I was born, man.

480
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:54,515
Happy Birthday!

481
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:55,734
I'll miss you!

482
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,402
We have a special
birthday gift for you.

483
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,188
It's called Vertigo. It's supposed
 to make you feel all floaty.

484
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,290
Uh, if my mom
caught me with this,

485
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,409
I wouldn't make it to 19.

486
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,311
I'm gonna
go put it upstairs,

487
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:09,464
and then I'll be
right back down.

488
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,087
♪ Come on down

489
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:20,642
Moira, I have a little
something for you.

490
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:22,710
Walter...

491
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,227
I did as you asked.

492
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,681
Now it's your turn
to do as I asked.

493
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:29,185
I'll take care of it.

494
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,210
Thank you, Moira.

495
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,743
At my party.

496
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:39,295
Right here in front of me?

497
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:40,663
No, Thea,
you don't understand.

498
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:43,049
Walter hasn't been gone
two months

499
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,918
and you're already
cheating on him.

500
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,386
Just like you did on dad.

501
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:47,971
Thea, I never cheated.

502
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:50,890
Like I would believe
anything you say.

503
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:55,512
No. I wish it had been you
that was on that boat.

504
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,408
I had a feeling
you'd show up.

505
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:01,794
Yeah? Why is that, Knox?

506
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,296
Right after Gaynor
got you hired,

507
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:04,747
someone hacked
our system.

508
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,883
First person to ever
make it through our firewall.

509
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:08,784
You want to tell me
how you did it?

510
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:11,054
I'm not really sure.

511
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,889
He didn't think you'd be
very cooperative.

512
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:14,924
Who?

513
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,431
Hey, John.

514
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:31,237
Ted, you're part of this?

515
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,406
No, not part of.

516
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:37,010
My men. My mission.

517
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,245
Mission?

518
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,847
This isn't Afghanistan.

519
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,550
Oh, don't I know that.

520
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:46,186
Over there we were trusted
with millions of dollars

521
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:48,138
in weapons and personnel.

522
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,974
We were conquerors.

523
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,477
Now we're nannies
with tasers.

524
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:00,367
So that gives you
the right to steal,

525
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,435
to kill innocent civilians?

526
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:04,704
I'm not gonna convince
you I'm right.

527
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:06,957
I am gonna convince you
to join the team.

528
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,109
Yeah, now I know
you're crazy.

529
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,661
Earlier tonight
was supposed to be our last score,

530
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,748
but because of the Hood
guy, we struck out.

531
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,485
Now we're down a man.

532
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,837
Good thing you're
qualified to take his place.

533
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,289
Ted, I think your convincing

534
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:27,344
is gonna have to be
a lot more convincing.

535
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,678
Copy that.

536
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,947
Cavanaugh.

537
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,569
Carly.

538
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,137
You son of a bitch.

539
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,656
Kill her.
No!

540
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,408
Don't! Don't! Wait!

541
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,576
Don't.
Knox.

542
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:51,451
You both can die
tonight, John.

543
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:53,870
Or once we do this,
we're on a plane

544
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,822
and she can go home
to your nephew.

545
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:58,124
It's your call.

546
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:40,583
Well, you shouldn't have
done that, Dig.

547
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,919
Now you gotta watch us
kill your pretty little girlfriend.

548
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,554
No! Please don't!

549
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,506
You're forgetting
one thing, guys.

550
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,008
Oh, yeah,
what's that?

551
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,894
I'm the one
with the grenade.

552
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:54,514
Carly, get out of there!

553
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,798
Freeze!

554
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,754
Drop it, Ted,

555
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:44,306
or I swear...

556
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:47,876
Don't...posture.

557
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,147
You're not gonna do it.

558
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:54,266
You can't.

559
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:55,901
I can see it
in your eyes.

560
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:15,921
You're late.

561
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,706
You knew I was coming?

562
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,744
Next time you plant
a bug on someone,

563
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,097
be more subtle
about it.

564
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,933
I wish you
trusted me, though.

565
00:35:27,935 --> 00:35:30,769
I trust you, Diggle.

566
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:35,640
But them, never.

567
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:41,780
You should get
out of here.

568
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,252
John!

569
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,747
Carly. You okay?

570
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:02,117
Turn around and put your hands
where I can see them.

571
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:43,270
Oh, Thea.

572
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:44,971
Are you okay?

573
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:46,940
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

574
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:49,309
I'm just headachy, really.

575
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,745
The car--is--is it--

576
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:54,197
Thea, the car isn't
important right now.

577
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:59,319
Do you remember
what happened, sweetheart?

578
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,988
You go away.

579
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:06,326
Thea, please.

580
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:09,129
I said I'm fine.

581
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:18,522
Now, when Larry shows up
tonight,

582
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:20,774
you gotta show him
and Janet that he doesn't--

583
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,178
Your father's even
beginning to call me now.

584
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,030
Don't waste your minutes.

585
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:33,153
Your father is a jerk,
but he's still your father.

586
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:36,923
They're broken up.

587
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,875
They're not gonna
get back together ever.

588
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,746
I think in his own way,

589
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:46,800
I think he sees himself
as protecting you somehow.

590
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:49,886
Yeah. He is really good
at using my dead mother

591
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:51,972
for an excuse
for being a jerk.

592
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:56,226
You never talk
about your mother.

593
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,645
I was only 8 and I
don't remember much

594
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:02,015
about what happened.

595
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:04,601
But after...

596
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:08,721
My father completely
shut me out.

597
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:16,930
And then he went away.

598
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,753
He was gone for maybe
a year or two.

599
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:26,706
I was 8 and he left me.

600
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:30,677
That is who my father is.

601
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,096
He only cares about himself.

602
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:53,066
Cops give you a hard time?

603
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,869
Nah. I explained to them to me and
Gaynor were old war buddies.

604
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,455
He tried to rope me in...

605
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:01,458
When I refused,
he kidnapped Carly,

606
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,611
everything else
happened under duress.

607
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:13,470
I screwed up, Oliver.

608
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:17,591
Obviously Gaynor
wasn't who I thought he was.

609
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:20,760
I was wrong.

610
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:23,480
Yeah, but...

611
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:25,798
you were right, too.

612
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,179
When you told me
that I trusted the list

613
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,735
more than I trusted you...

614
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:38,311
Diggle, the truth is, after what
happened to me on the island...

615
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:46,620
It's difficult for me
to trust...anything.

616
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:52,259
But you do.

617
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:56,880
And that reminded me
why I chose you as my partner.

618
00:39:56,882 --> 00:40:00,217
It's because you see
the best in people.

619
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:37,637
I learned something, too.

620
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,000
Until you tell me,
I'll never want to know

621
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,701
what other names
are in this book.

622
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:54,321
She promised me she's
not cheating on Walter.

623
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:57,107
Like I would trust
anything that woman says.

624
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:59,326
Miss Queen!
Thea Queen?

625
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:00,827
Is there a problem?

626
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,028
We received a call
from your doctor.

627
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,446
In the event
of a vehicular accident,

628
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:04,748
they're required
to report to result

629
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,232
of the driver's
tox screen.

630
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:10,170
Miss Queen tested positive
for a narcotic called Vertigo.

631
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:12,789
The drug they're using
in the Glades?

632
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,040
Thea Queen, you're under arrest

633
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:16,092
for driving under
the influence of narcotics.

634
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:28,855
Do you know why my men
wear balaclavas, Mr. Queen?

635
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:33,426
Because it masks
everything but the eyes.

636
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:37,697
In a man's eyes, one can
always find the truth.

637
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:42,285
You risked everything
to save your friend.

638
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:44,937
Someone I warned you about,

639
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,240
yet you trusted him.

640
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:50,293
But that trust was misplaced.
