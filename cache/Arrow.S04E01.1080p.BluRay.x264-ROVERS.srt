1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,611
<i>Last</i> season, on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,761
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,202
All that pain and misery you brought back
from that island?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,086
The reason I came back was to try and save
the people of this city.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,362
You've got the wrong guy.
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,840
I am.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,282
Everyone thinks the Arrow is dead,
which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,727
<i>When I joined the League,
I was conscripted with another man,</i>

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,962
<i>Damien Darhk.
Damien continues the League's ways,</i>

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,408
<i>but through his own organization
filled with a hive of agents.</i>

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,886
John?

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,281
Something's wrong.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,602
First, let me assure you
that no harm will come to Lyla.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,885
You didn't just lose my friendship.
You lost my trust. You lost my respect.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,725
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,281
I had to keep the circle
as small as possible.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,965
You opened up my heart
in a way I didn't even know was possible.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,646
<i>I love you.</i>

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,283
Can I say something strange? I'm happy.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,444
- Good morning.
- How're you doing?

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,521
Hey-

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,321
Oh. Okay.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,361
Hot.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,367
- Felicity Smoak.
- Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,680
You have failed this omelet.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,042
- Really?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,523
You know, it's criminal how easily
cooking comes to you.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,047
Well, I always wanted to
expand my horizons

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,531
beyond what I could do on the island,

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,480
which was basically,
it was cooked and uncooked.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,121
- How was yourjog?
- It was good.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,806
I'm getting used to running
without chasing after someone.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,567
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm kind of sweaty.

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,484
I know. It's amazing.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,886
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,205
Why'd you get this one removed?

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,210
I don't need it anymore.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,687
So, what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,208
A videoconference
with the Palmer Tech board,

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,809
who still question whether
I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,047
Hey, how'd you like your company back
as an early Christmas gift?

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,089
I think you're doing a betterjob
of running it than I would.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,642
- It's flirting with bankruptcy.
- Exactly. It's just flirting.

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,410
- Mmm. What?
- I got to go.

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,641
Where are you going now?

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,208
Uh, I have to get stuff at the
farmers' market for brunch tomorrow.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,051
Right, the Hoffmans are coming over.
I forgot.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,770
I don't think I'm ever gonna get tired
of making plans

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,889
that don't involve people shooting at me.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,684
This is so cool!

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,931
We're really gonna have to work
on your definition of "cool."

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,846
Get me up there!

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,284
This is so awesome!

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,921
Whoo!

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,804
Speedy, behind you.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,447
I thought I told you guys
to call me Red Arrow.

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,927
<i>A red arrow
just means you can't make a left turn.</i>

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,884
Whatever, I'm inside the hijacked truck.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,965
Canary, you'r€ UP-

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,090
Damn it! They have backup.

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,001
Anyone manage to get eyes
on that stolen cargo?

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,043
They looked like equipment containers.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,121
Not equipment, weapons.

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,810
Among other things, Kord Industries

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,689
<i>is one of the largest arms manufacturers
in the world.</i>

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,888
They also make
a really awesome cell phone.

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,283
- No, but weapons are more likely.
- Much.

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,046
These Ghosts, if that's seriously
what we're calling 'em,

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,891
are stepping up their attacks, escalating.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,122
People are so scared,
they don't even wanna leave their homes.

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,845
Unless it's to pack up
in the middle of the night

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,206
and get the hell out of town.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,567
What do you want us to do?
Take our football and go home?

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,564
No. We ask for help.

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,051
Oliver walked away.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,407
That was before these guys
started taking over our city

77
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,244
and turning it into a war zone.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,561
We're dealing with a crisis.

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,207
Which Oliver believed
we could handle, Laurel.

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,765
And he was right.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,082
I spoke to Walter Steele last night.
He passed.

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,446
Does that surprise you?

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,001
In three years, we've had three mayors
and one candidate for mayor

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,247
who have all ended up dead.

85
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,841
Anyone with any common sense
is not gonna throw their hat in the ring.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,206
So we just go on as we have?

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,528
Running City Hall by committee
instead of electing a mayor?

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,007
Maybe we should have you focused
on catching these Ghosts.

89
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,447
That's just what
the media calls them.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,090
Because they disappear like ghosts.

91
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,730
Yeah. I didn't say it wasn't cute.

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,761
The truth is
these guys are hard to catch.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,962
They're not your
average everyday criminals.

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,044
Average everyday criminals don't have
cyanide capsules in their teeth

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,607
so they can off themselves
rather than be interrogated.

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,450
I'm doing the best I can here.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,204
We need you to do better.

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,284
This city was dying before
more masks showed up to wreak havoc.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,444
Look, we'll get these guys eventually.
And things will turn around.

100
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,644
I mean, look, we've rebranded the city.
We got the new tourism program.

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,643
We got the new high-speed rail line
to Central City.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,404
Hopefully, from Central City.

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,326
Well, maybe we could have a Flash Day,
just like them.

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,441
Bottom line, we need an influx of people,
which means an influx of cash.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,769
No, no, no. Keep your seats.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,082
Excuse me, this is a private meeting.

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,926
Oh, excellent, I despise interruptions.

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,847
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

109
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,163
I'm the man you're looking for.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,610
I'm the one who controls the...
What do you people call them? The Ghosts?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,128
So, you're all fretting
about this city dying.

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,166
I'm here on behalf of an organization
that wants you to let it die.

113
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,771
See, death is a beautiful thing.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,851
We die, we go into the ground,
our remains grow into flowers.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,083
It's only in the interval after dying
that new things can sprout.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,609
- That's enough. Get the hell out of...
- Cities are like puppies.

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,763
You see them writhing in agony
on the streets,

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,201
you put them down,
you don't let them suffer.

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,284
- I'm getting security.
- Susanna, calm down. Get down.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,209
It's very rude behavior.

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,682
None of you seem particularly likable,

122
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,442
but if you do have any friends
or anyone who does love you,

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,529
I suggest you say goodbye.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,563
My people will be in touch.

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,007
Mmm.

126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,006
Oh, Oliver, these eggs are heaven!
Don't tell me you made them in the...

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,561
In the slow cooker.
The slow cooker you got us, yeah.

128
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,325
<i>I knew it, I knew it.</i>

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,170
People are always so hesitant to try them,

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,084
but slow cookers
are absolute life changers.

131
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,208
I don't know how
that is not a bumper sticker yet.

132
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,164
I know!

133
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,885
<i>On the topic of life changers,</i>

134
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,845
you guys really need to
get on the school situation here.

135
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,010
We could write you a recommendation letter
for our school's waiting list.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,329
But wouldn't it help to have
kids first? Or, I don't know, a kid?

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,562
Oh, it takes years to get on that list.

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,326
And I'm sure kids aren't too far
down the line for you two.

139
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,244
Yeah, we haven't talked about it.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,204
Who wants more mimosas?

141
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,842
- I need to see it. Do you have it on you?
- Honey, it's not...

142
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,201
Baby. You have it on you, right?

143
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,845
- Do you have it?
- Yep.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,241
- Oh, it's stunning.
- It's my mother's.

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,205
- So, when are you gonna pop the question?
- Tonight.

146
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,124
What are you guys talking about? Whoop!

147
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,521
Whoa.

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,044
Dude! Nice reflexes.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,406
Back off, psycho.

150
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,723
Six people have died
from the crank you've been pushing.

151
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,126
Four of them were kids!

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,487
You've certainly chosen
an unusual hobby, Mr. Queen.

153
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,165
<i>He said he'd kill us all.</i>

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,970
That was a hell of a press conference.

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,245
These people needed a strong reminder
that this city doesn't bow to terrorists.

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,330
Susanna?

157
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,083
I thought that tasted funny.

158
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,126
- Call 9-1-1!
- What happened?

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,449
John, we have a new problem.

160
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,604
City leadership is being targeted.
They just poisoned the District Attorney.

161
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,963
I'm headed to my father. I need you
and Thea on the other two members.

162
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,285
I'm closest to the head of Emergency
Services. Thea, I need you at City Hall.

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,360
Are you okay?

164
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,124
Can we get a nurse over here?

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,001
Okay, listen,
the District Attorney just collapsed.

166
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,891
Staffers think it might be poison,
but I need toxicology...

167
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,527
<i>Drop it!</i>

168
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,243
All right, all right, all right.

169
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,882
All right, all right, all right.

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,570
Just hold on. I'll get you some help.

171
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,160
You, okay?

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,923
<i>Captain Lance, you were warned.</i>

173
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,927
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a flesh wound.

174
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,930
Captain Lance,
the District Attorney was pronounced dead.

175
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,201
And reports are coming in

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,362
that the city comptroller and
the head of Emergency Services

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,721
have also been killed.

178
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,644
That's pretty much the city's leadership.

179
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,647
Carries on like this,
there won't be a city left to lead.

180
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,564
- So, what's the occasion?
- Do we need an occasion for dinner?

181
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,205
No, ever since you discovered cooking,

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,483
our life's been a never-ending episode
of MasterChef.

183
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,291
But this isn't a dinner.
This is a production.

184
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,250
Are we celebrating something?

185
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,408
Sort of depends on how dessert goes.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,881
No. No, no. I'm almost disgustingly full.

187
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,402
<i>You are going to have to try</i> a <i>bite
or two of this souffle'.</i>

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,968
Diet saved by the bell.

189
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,289
- Um...
- What's going on?

190
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,491
You have visitors.

191
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,648
We probably should've called first, but...

192
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,446
We really need your help.

193
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,005
<i>The media's been
calling them the Ghosts.</i>

194
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,766
They're like nothing we'd ever seen
before. Well trained. Well-armed.

195
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,001
And committed.

196
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,084
Anytime we get too close to one of them,
they off themselves with cyanide.

197
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,442
- What's their agenda?
- At first, we thought they were thieves

198
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,443
because they were hitting banks
and jewelry stores.

199
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,490
But then we found out that they've
just been building their war chest.

200
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,001
They've now been stealing munitions
and heavy arms.

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,123
- And assassinating people.
- Hon.

202
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,648
- Where are the police?
- Overwhelmed.

203
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,889
Well, a group of this size has to be
work out of a central location,

204
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,610
a base of operations.

205
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,524
Which we haven't been able to find.

206
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,167
Digs seems to think we can handle it.

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,121
You disagree?

208
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,284
I think we're in over our heads.

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,731
We need the Arrow.

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,846
Uh...

211
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,962
- The Arrow's dead.
- We're hoping that's not the case.

212
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,567
We're hoping that you can't change
who you are in your bones.

213
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,404
Come help us stop these guys,

214
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,249
and then you can come back here to your
domestic life of tranquility and soufflés.

215
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,163
You're uncharacteristically quiet.

216
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,006
What should I say?
Our friends need our help.

217
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,725
We should already be in the car.

218
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,844
How'd you find me?

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,209
The world's too small for someone
like Oliver Queen to disappear.

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,684
Truth be told,
I expected to find you in Starling City.

221
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,689
I don't wanna be near my family.

222
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,604
Because of what you did to Shrieve?

223
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,368
I read his autopsy report.

224
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,080
I knew you had a capacity
for the unfathomable,

225
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,408
but I actually underestimated you.

226
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,369
What do you want, Amanda?

227
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,403
To help you.

228
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,763
You haven't returned home because
you feel you're a monster.

229
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,964
And you're trying to deny it,
channeling your killer instinct

230
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,531
into something productive.

231
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,048
But you can't change who you are
in your bones.

232
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,605
I don't need a therapist.

233
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,240
The hood and eye makeup suggest otherwise.

234
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,450
Stop trying to run
from your inner darkness.

235
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,761
Embrace it.

236
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,605
Let it run its course.

237
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,485
Oftentimes, the only way out is through.

238
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,966
Through what?

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,121
A.R.G.U.S. agents.

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,011
When you wake up, just remember
that I'm trying to help you.

241
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,687
Here I thought that my days of riding
in the back of limos were long gone.

242
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,811
Oh. One of the perks of being
Palmer Technologies' CEO in absentia.

243
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,171
Now that I'm back,
they might actually expect me to do stuff.

244
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,846
I wouldn't worry.
We're not gonna stay long.

245
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,486
Geez!

246
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,801
It's tough not to look out this window
and wonder.

247
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,011
Wonder what?

248
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,049
What did we really accomplish?

249
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,845
Felicity and I have a lot of catch up on,

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,002
so maybe take us through the evidence
the team has gathered.

251
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,889
That's easy. Nothing.

252
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,523
Okay. So, maybe we'll go through
all the encounters

253
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,846
that you've had with the Ghosts,

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,162
everywhere they've hid,
and then Felicity can cross...

255
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,528
- John.
- We should've discussed this.

256
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,047
- Thea and I did.
- We need him.

257
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,849
I'm not expecting you to
welcome me back with open arms.

258
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,964
What I did to you is not easily forgiven.

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,522
I'm here to help you with your problem,
and then I'm gone.

260
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,091
Oliver, we don't need your help.

261
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,730
And if we did,
we'd probably choose someone

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,570
who didn't kidnap my wife
and endanger my child.

263
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,564
And no one is asking you to pretend like
that didn't happen.

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,729
But we're in trouble.
This city is in trouble.

265
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,042
Laurel, I don't need you
to remind me of that.

266
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,408
I just can't go into battle
with a man I don't trust.

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,247
Understood, but things are a little worse
than you guys thought.

268
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,609
I hacked into Kord Industries' computers
just to see what the Ghosts stole.

269
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,569
Cluster bombs,
sensor-fused and high yield.

270
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,569
Any more powerful
and they'd have to be nuclear.

271
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,891
What do you wanna do, John?

272
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,242
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to save my city.

273
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,764
Weapons need targets.
These had to be stolen for a reason.

274
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,724
Felicity, hack into
Kord Industries databases.

275
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,247
I wanna know everything that there is
to know about these explosives.

276
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,090
Laurel, you wanna start a dialogue
with your father,

277
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,406
make a list of potential targets.

278
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,370
Digg, Thea, hit the streets.
See what we can find.

279
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,762
Oh. Sorry, sorry. Just old habits.

280
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,281
It's probably not a bad idea
to give your father a heads-up.

281
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,121
Copy - John.

282
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,244
Look, I have a wife and a toddler
to get back home to.

283
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,323
Felicity, will you let me know
if you find anything?

284
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,289
Will do. Say hi to Lyla for me.

285
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,965
He'll come around.

286
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,486
I'll go hit the streets.

287
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Well, I have to say that it feels good
to be at a keyboard

288
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,490
for something other than a teleconference.

289
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,484
I need a map with a list
of all the spots the Ghosts have hit,

290
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,290
including where they encountered the team.

291
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,771
And if we get lucky maybe we can...

292
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,450
Triangulate and determine
a point of origin

293
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,443
where the Ghosts
are operating out of, yes.

294
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,761
Yeah.

295
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,487
All right, here's a list
of all their heists and attacks.

296
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,444
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

297
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,967
Yeah, like, um, riding a bike.

298
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,770
First spot they hit
was the Larson Credit Union?

299
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,524
- No, no, no, it was Starling National.
- Really?

300
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,603
- Mmm-hmm.
- How'd you know that?

301
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,649
Same way you knew about Larson.

302
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,649
- Felicity. Wanna play again?
- Mmm?

303
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,080
What game are we playing?

304
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,448
We're playing "the reason that you know
so much about the Ghosts"

305
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,924
"is because you've been helping the team
behind my back" game.

306
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,366
These guys have got cluster bombs now?
You've got to be kidding me.

307
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,331
That's why I'm here, to see
if you're aware of any potential targets.

308
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,648
The only thing I'm aware of is that
I want you to stay as far away

309
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
- from this mess as possible.
- Dad, I thought we'd moved past this.

310
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
We moved past a lot of things.
And I am glad, really.

311
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,362
But I don't want you mixing it up
with these psychos.

312
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,682
Even after what happened
to city leadership?

313
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,884
I mean, honestly, I thought that
you would be happy to have our help.

314
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,281
Do I look happy?

315
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,411
Dad, the Ghosts were dangerous

316
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,040
before they got their hands
on experimental explosives.

317
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,004
How are you gonna feel
when they take out a city block,

318
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,645
knowing you didn't do anything to stop it?

319
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,246
Have you heard of anything going on
that's a potential target?

320
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,687
Landmarks, Starling General, et cetera.

321
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
What about city events?
Any dignitaries coming to town?

322
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,404
A few ball games, concerts.
Not that there's anyone to buy a ticket.

323
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,251
Train station's getting reopened
tomorrow night for the new rail line,

324
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,165
and Starling General's
having a canned food drive.

325
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,486
People don't come to
Star City anymore, Laurel.

326
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,081
They wanna leave.

327
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,927
Who is the cutest?
Who is the cutest ever, ever?

328
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,885
Playing with her like that,
I'm pretty sure it's you.

329
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,210
It's amazing how everything else
can just melt away except for her.

330
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,564
What's melting tonight?

331
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,050
I know it's been a rough few months.

332
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,409
These men you're dealing with.

333
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,082
Tonight, it's just one man.
Oliver's back.

334
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,761
That didn't take long.

335
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,969
You knew he was coming back,
why didn't you warn me?

336
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,285
What's the saying?
"Only the dead have seen the end of war."

337
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,245
- Please, Oliver's not a soldier.
- Isn't he?

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,811
That's pretty forgiving, considering
he kidnapped you six months ago.

339
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,641
You know why he did.
You have to let go of it sometime.

340
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,402
- I have.
- It's because you're better than me.

341
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,483
It's one of the reasons why I love you.

342
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,606
It was war, Johnny. Maybe not against
a country, but it was war.

343
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,971
And in times of war,
we do what we have to do.

344
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,401
Really, Lyla?

345
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,930
I mean, that includes lying to me?
Lying to Felicity?

346
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,565
Come on, what's the point?

347
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,451
Oliver did what he thought he had to do
to defeat Ra's.

348
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,768
I'm not saying he made the right choice.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
But if Oliver Queen
always made the right choice,

350
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,245
he wouldn't need you.

351
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,402
I used to think
that yelling Oliver was scary.

352
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,841
I'm starting to think that
silent Oliver is a lot worse.

353
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,849
I'm just going over
the past five months in my head.

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,128
When you got food poisoning
when we were in Thailand.

355
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,482
Yes. I might've been secretly
working with the team,

356
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,842
but I didn't exactly lie
about the food poisoning.

357
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,650
Laab Moo is extremely hard to digest.

358
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,367
What about when you missed our boat?
"Missed," in Positano.

359
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,929
Okay, that one was a little fib.

360
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,360
Bali?

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,002
Felicity, you said there wasn't
even email involved!

362
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,687
I know, but we both know
I'm just that good.

363
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,205
I don't understand.

364
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,647
The whole point of starting over
was to get away from all of this.

365
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,002
And we were both right there together
leading that charge.

366
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,322
I know. And I thought
that's what we needed.

367
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,528
And the first few months
were great, really great.

368
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,371
But then when you and Laura Hoffman
started exchanging cooking tips,

369
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,522
I secretly wanted to gouge out my eyes.

370
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,529
- I thought you were happy.
- I was.

371
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,203
Deliriously happy with you,
but bored with everything else.

372
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,570
Look, I miss this.
I miss saving the city and helping people.

373
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,201
It gives my life purpose.

374
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,727
And I wish I got the same thrill
from choosing between

375
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,681
the dimpled flatware and the scalloped,
but I just don't.

376
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,851
Hey, I don't care that you lied to me.
I don't care.

377
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,847
I care that the entire time
we were supposed to be away, together.

378
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,844
Part of you was still here.

379
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,927
I love every moment that I'm with you,
no matter where we are.

380
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,927
What's that?

381
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,890
I hacked Kord Industries to check out
the design schematics for their bombs.

382
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,570
Turns out they have
a GPS tracker built in.

383
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,762
- Can you find out where it is?
- At least where they've been.

384
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,890
GPS is offline now,
but their last location was...

385
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,167
It's a truck depot outside Pennytown.
Closed up shop months ago.

386
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,402
I'll call Thea. You get Laurel and Dig.

387
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,245
This may be a good time to tell you that
Cisco worked up a little something

388
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,926
before he knew you were leaving.
A new suit.

389
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,128
I'm not staying long enough
for a new suit.

390
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,562
I heard about places like this.

391
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,451
Owners must've left
when the city started tanking.

392
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,202
Well, our new friends
seem to have found a use for it.

393
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,563
Gentlemen, the world's a funny place.

394
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,770
It resists change, it fights progress.

395
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,604
And so the only way to move things forward
is to fight back.

396
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,891
And you men are here today
because you understand that.

397
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,880
But our cause is only as strong
as our weakest man.

398
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,123
Mr. Alvarez, please step forward.

399
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,049
You commanded the hijacking
the other night.

400
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,169
The cluster bombs from Kord Industries.

401
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,445
Yes, sir. We encountered
some resistance, but we handled it.

402
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,967
MR. x; And handled...

403
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,008
Well, I guess my definition of "handled"
is a little different than yours.

404
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,569
You see, when I handle a problem,
the problem dies.

405
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,484
Sir, we got away with the bombs, so...

406
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,129
You know, I love this town in the fall.

407
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,489
I mean, yes, it looks pretty much the same
as it does in the three other seasons,

408
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,286
but I admire consistency.

409
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,171
I respect dependability.

410
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,802
And you've shown me neither.
So, now, allow me to show you something.

411
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,321
It's another kind of beauty.

412
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,808
It's the manipulation
of primordial energies.

413
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,329
No? Over your head? Yeah.

414
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,809
The grazing of the levers
that God uses to move the world.

415
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,371
No? No?

416
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,887
This.

417
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,687
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell is that?

418
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,201
Move!

419
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,526
Hey, Speedy!

420
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,042
SCPD, put your hands in the air!

421
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,922
What are they gonna do
with the explosives?

422
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,565
Tell me!

423
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,087
They're gonna destroy Star City Station.

424
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,600
Hands where I can see them.

425
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,885
We got to go! We got to go!

426
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,126
Oh, I remember that look.
That is not a good look.

427
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,884
We found out
what they have planned at least.

428
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,441
They're gonna use the explosives
on the new train station.

429
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,927
Yeah, pretty sure
I had that one in the office pool.

430
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,766
Too soon?

431
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,570
They're probably planning the attack
for tomorrow night,

432
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,444
to celebrate the reopening
of the new rail line.

433
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,246
Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened?

434
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,602
That dude just killed that guy
by touching him.

435
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,565
Wait. We're dealing with a metahuman?
Like we didn't have enough problems?

436
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,807
He wasn't a metahuman.

437
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,644
Oliver, what that man did was not natural.

438
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,928
I know. it was mystical.

439
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,645
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

440
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,925
Because I've seen things.

441
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,326
There are things that can't be explained,
even by science.

442
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,126
I suppose you aren't gonna tell us
about these things you've seen, Oliver?

443
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,163
We need to focus
on finding the cluster bombs.

444
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,726
Can you reactivate the GPS?

445
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,248
Yeah, eventually, but I'm pretty sure the
train station's gonna be blown up by then.

446
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,330
Fine. So we do this the old-fashioned way.

447
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,282
So, this is the old fashioned way?

448
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,847
Can we maybe discuss last night?

449
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,648
It's pretty amazing, right?

450
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,162
How could you ever
wanna give up that rush?

451
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,970
Extremely easily.

452
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,450
It's not what I'm talking about.
You seemed a little out of control.

453
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,171
This coming from the guy who used
to use criminals as target practice?

454
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,011
I'm amazed by how far you've come
in five months,

455
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,522
and I'm under no illusions
that this isn't a violent life.

456
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,686
I just want you to remember that
it's restraint separating us and them.

457
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,203
Well, you've managed to be back, what,
24 hours before giving me a lecture.

458
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,283
Think I owe Laurel 50 bucks.

459
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,686
I'm being serious.

460
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,124
How long has this been going on for?

461
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,968
Nothing is going on, okay?
I've just become a better fighter.

462
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,561
A better fighter remains in control
when they fight.

463
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,811
Is everything okay?

464
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,965
It's not okay.

465
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,044
My brother
can't seem to stay out of my business.

466
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,804
All passengers...

467
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,323
- Any luck?
- No.

468
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,406
Does Thea seem a little off to you?

469
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,247
No, she's fine.
Just a little too aggressive, maybe.

470
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,645
But I remember you were same way
when you started out.

471
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,651
I saw that you took my advice
on the identity concealment.

472
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,564
Oliver, man, what are we doing?

473
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,526
Pretending everything's normal?
That we are normal?

474
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,921
I'm looking for a way in.

475
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,323
I was furious to think that you trusted
Malcolm Merlyn more than you trusted me,

476
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,249
but then I realized
that I'm not angry at you.

477
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,240
I'm angry at myself for thinking
you're someone that you clearly aren't.

478
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,170
I don't know what that means.

479
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,601
Oliver, after everything
we've been through, man.

480
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,002
I couldn't fathom why you didn't trust me.

481
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,208
But then I realized you couldn't.
It's not who you are.

482
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,442
You don't trust. You don't love.

483
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,569
You were able to fool Ra's
and join the League

484
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,605
because inside you were
every bit as dark as they are.

485
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,206
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

486
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,966
Responding to a bomb threat's
kind of in the SCPD job description.

487
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,646
You know what I mean.
I'm glad we're working together.

488
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,087
Well, it seems like you're working
with a lot of people these days.

489
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,884
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Excuse me.

490
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,566
- Dad.
- Prodigal Arrow returns.

491
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,723
- Captain Lance.
- I thought that was you last night.

492
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,604
Some mask over your head.
Felt like old times.

493
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,961
Only trying to help.

494
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,129
If that were true,
you wouldn't have come back.

495
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,448
This town started going to crap
the moment you put on that hood.

496
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,130
You brought madness into all our lives,

497
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,449
and the monster you were
inspired monsters.

498
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,641
Maybe.

499
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,484
But I'm not a monster anymore.

500
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,925
Then what are you?

501
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
Nice nap?

502
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,606
I wasn't napping, I was drugged.
Where's Waller?

503
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,326
Back in Coast City,
sleeping off the scotch.

504
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,966
Wake her up.
I wanna know what I'm doing here.

505
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,205
Director Waller's asked me to thank you
for agreeing to take on this mission.

506
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,364
Okay, look, I didn't agree to take on...

507
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,522
Sorry, we're on a bit of a clock here.

508
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,046
Now, you're getting out of this plane.

509
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,363
You can do that with a chute on your back
or a bullet in your head. Your call.

510
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,726
Why is Waller doing this?

511
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,724
I guess she likes you. And I didn't think
Waller could like anybody.

512
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,804
- Plus, you know the terrain.
- What terrain?

513
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,483
Your job is to infiltrate the area,
assess the threat and report back.

514
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,809
You have AES-encrypted communication gear
in your pack.

515
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,330
Now, according to our intel,
your target may be radar-capable,

516
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,648
so you'll have to HALO in!

517
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,051
So when you think you're about to splat,
only then do you pull the chute.

518
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,480
Wait. Is that...

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,002
Uh-oh. You have mopey face.

520
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,089
Were you worried
after five months of happiness

521
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,163
that you weren't gonna be able to
make it anymore?

522
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,930
I ran into Lance.

523
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,560
And he gave you a hug
because he missed you?

524
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,206
Yeah, well, it's not just Lance.

525
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,610
Thea, there is something wrong with Thea.

526
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,444
She doesn't want my help.
Neither does Diggle.

527
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,365
We should never have come back here.

528
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,770
Let's go. Let's go home.

529
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,764
You don't wanna go home.

530
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,530
I love our new home.

531
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,285
And I love you.

532
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,931
But I also love it here, and you can't
honestly tell me that you don't.

533
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,283
Yeah, no, of course, I miss aspects of it.

534
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,205
The sense of purpose, the idea of
helping people, but Lance was right.

535
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,811
About what?

536
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,364
A few months ago, he told me that
all I brought back from the island

537
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,965
was pain,

538
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,803
misery and darkness.

539
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,328
And of course,
I knew that the moment we came back here

540
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,483
that darkness would be waiting for me.

541
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,960
Well, he's wrong, dead wrong.

542
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,322
You didn't bring the darkness back
with you from Lian Yu.

543
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,086
But, Felicity, I'm telling you
that the only way I know

544
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,005
how to fight the darkness
is to be darkness.

545
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,083
That is why I left.

546
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,086
And I don't wanna be
that type of person anymore.

547
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,568
Then maybe you just need to be
a different kind of person.

548
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,008
And you're not doing this alone anymore.

549
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,924
Train station was a bust.

550
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,323
No incendiaries on the platform,
on the tracks or inside any of the trains.

551
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,845
Yeah, but if there's no bomb
in the station,

552
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,002
then how do they expect to blow it up?

553
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,522
You didn't bring the darkness here.

554
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,807
The bombs aren't at the station
because they're bringing them in.

555
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,287
On a train. When's the reopening ceremony
scheduled for?

556
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,206
9:58. To coincide with the arrival of the
first high-speed train from Central City.

557
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,807
- Let's suit up.
- You should suit up, too.

558
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,647
What?

559
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,165
Get me closer!

560
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,967
I'm trying!

561
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,403
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the first train from Central City</i>

562
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,171
<i>will be arriving shortly.</i>

563
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,571
Everybody, get out of here! It's not safe!

564
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,844
Out of the way!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

565
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,961
- Whoa. You're really strong.
- Go.

566
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,207
Thank you!

567
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,570
<i>This is SCPD. Everyone,
quickly and quietly evacuate the station.</i>

568
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,531
<i>Everyone, move calmly
towards the exit. Calmly!</i>

569
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,528
Train is 10 minutes out.
Six minutes till safest blast radius.

570
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,685
Situation report.

571
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,206
Mr. Slater?

572
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,126
Sorry, he had to get off
at an earlier stop.

573
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,484
You can't be the Arrow. He died.
So who are you?

574
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,051
You're about to find out.

575
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,202
Stop the train.

576
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,845
No, I don't want to.

577
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,604
Even if I did, I couldn't. I destroyed
the braking system 20 miles ago.

578
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,406
Willing to die to destroy a train station?

579
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,931
No. That would be ridiculous.

580
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,082
Then how were you planning on
getting off the train?

581
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,203
Oh, you don't know who I am, do you?

582
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,325
I'm Damien Darhk.

583
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,410
Is that all you got?

584
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,286
It seems you've much in common
with the Arrow. You're both dead.

585
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,806
Thank you.

586
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,450
We need to stop the train.

587
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,126
- You got any ideas?
- Yeah. Blow it up.

588
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,527
Whoa.

589
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,562
So what're you gonna call yourself now?
Everybody thinks Roy was the Arrow.

590
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,445
Well, he won't need a code name
if he's headed back to Ivy Town.

591
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,163
Well, then I guess I need a code name.

592
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,329
Felicity and I, we have missed this.

593
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,171
We've missed all of you.

594
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,167
And this city is far worse off
than we thought.

595
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,481
What are you talking about?

596
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,404
The man leading the Ghosts
is Damien Darhk.

597
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,410
Darhk left Star City months ago.
Why would he come back?

598
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,530
Did Ra's tell you anything about Darhk
that'd give us any idea about his agenda?

599
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,481
He said that Damien Darhk
had a hive of operatives at his disposal.

600
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,405
"Hive." That was the exact word he used?

601
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,763
Yes. Why? Does it mean something to you?

602
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,241
Who would wanna kill Andy?

603
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,171
Don't know their names. Just an alias.

604
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,531
Hive.

605
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,766
No.

606
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,011
- No, nothing.
- You all right?

607
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,162
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, man. I'm just beat.

608
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,723
Plus, I have a little girl to tuck in.

609
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,728
John. John!

610
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,006
Listen, I'm not quite there yet, Oliver,
so let's not do this right now.

611
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,043
No, I know. I get it.

612
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,848
But there is something we do need to do.

613
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,087
- Captain, new problem.
- Seriously?

614
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,282
Someone's hacked into
the Emergency Broadcast System.

615
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,090
They've taken over all the networks.

616
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,408
<i>Six months ago, the Arrow died.</i>

617
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,330
<i>But what he stood for didn't.</i>

618
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,889
It lived on in the heroes
who took up his mantle.

619
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,120
<i>People who believe that this city
should never descend into hopelessness.</i>

620
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,728
<i>Who believe, although life
is full of darkness,</i>

621
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,366
<i>that darkness can be defeated by light.</i>

622
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,451
<i>And tonight, I am declaring my intention
to stand with them.</i>

623
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,211
To fight for this city.

624
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,165
To be the symbol of hope
that the Arrow never was.

625
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,451
I am

626
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,401
the Green Arrow.

627
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,206
Who are you?

628
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
Answer me.

629
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,886
You have a visitor.

630
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,565
Sorry about the arm.

631
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,205
A necessary subterfuge

632
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,250
to prevent anyone from suspecting
your involvement with HIVE.

633
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,566
What do you want?

634
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,486
Well, I'm a little disappointed the train
station isn't a smoldering pile of ash.

635
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,884
I'm not. Mass murder? Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

636
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,169
You signed up to follow my instructions,
to do my will.

637
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,805
I wanna know everything
about this Green Arrow,

638
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,246
where he lives, and who he loves.

639
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,210
And I want him off the boards
by the time my associates arrive.

640
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,449
And if I don't help you?

641
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,085
Well, then I would be surprised.

642
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,171
'Cause I think I made it abundantly clear.
You don't have a choice.

643
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,688
So my guilt over displacing Thea is
only slightly outweighed

644
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,328
by how amazing this place is.

645
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,171
Thea's actually been living with Laurel
for the past few months.

646
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,762
- Oh.
- Ra's stabbed her right over there.

647
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,365
- Oh.
- We can get a rug.

648
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,921
You know, I'd hate to disappoint you.
That speech is pretty hopeful.

649
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,363
Why would that disappoint me?

650
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,046
Well, you know how you said that
you didn't know how to be a hero

651
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,322
without the darkness.

652
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,047
And I know how you hate being wrong.

653
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,849
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

654
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,686
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

655
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,167
There was a time
I would've thought this was my fault,

656
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,971
that I'd brought this darkness upon us.

657
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,722
But now I know it's not my fault.
It's my responsibility.

658
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Responsibility to do what?

659
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,846
To end it.

660
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,251
I'm gonna kill him.

661
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,164
Is there anything I can do?

662
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,930
I wanna be left alone.

663
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,001
Okay.

664
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,607
