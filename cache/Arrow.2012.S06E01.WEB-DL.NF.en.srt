Are you offering to help me find my son?

00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,090
I want us to find both of our sons.
I need your help.

-Yeah, I'm counting on it, sis.

00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,807
Adrian, where is my son?

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,059
When we get to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,978
-What?
-I'm not leaving William behind.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,896
Don't do that.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,232
He's rigged the entire island
with explosives.

11
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,568
They're remotely linked
to some sort of dead man's switch,

<i>if he dies, it detonates all the devices.</i>

Are you okay? Are you all right?

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,826
He wants you to kill him
so it kills all of us.

No, Adrian!

Well, his ordinance is.

If Faust is moving from bombs to missiles,

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,502
it makes you wonder
what else he's changed up.

Apologies. Won't be but a minute.

If you have the opportunity,
please advise your mayor

That's an MGM140. It's fire and forget.

You can't stop it.

You can't disarm it.

No.

As if detonation stirred

Chase sabotaged the plane,
we can't get off the island.

52
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,903
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship
on the eastern shore.

That's on the other side of the island.

You said you couldn't get it fixed.

For shielding us from the blast,
it should work just fine.

It's not like there's a whole lot
of other options.

I pretty much had to knock my mother
unconscious to get her on a flight

93
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,577
back to Vegas. She did not want to go.

in the field.

Come a long way in a year.

97
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,794
Yeah. Also makes me grateful for all
the times that Oliver kicked our ass.

98
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,337
Almost.

99

if he was, like, lactose...

Oh, I already ate, and unless you're

asking 'cause you think now is
a good time... Do you need a buffer?

111
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,407
I don't need a buffer.
I could use some company.

112
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
I know we talked about it

113
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,453
and he's getting used to me,
and it might be a little weird...

I mean, confusing, right?
For him... For us... For me, for you.

He said you're my father.

I'm gonna go find your mother.

and make sure that she's safe.

I promise you, but you have
to stay here, okay?

Good.

What?

141
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,812
What are you talking about? I had Tommy.

142
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,689
I wouldn't call having a friend
who helps you get into trouble

143
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,024
"fitting in."

144
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,568

This weekend, let's go see a Rockets game.

You know, as mayor,
I get pretty good seats...

I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

Okay.

Good night, William.

-Comfy?
-Could I get something to drink?

That'll be up to my lieutenant.

165
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,461
The gunmen, jerkwad.

166
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,670
Aah!

167
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,840
You were rolling with some pretty
highly-trained mercenaries tonight.

168
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,426
According to your friend
in the green hoodie.

169
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,263
Highly-trained means highly expensive.

170
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,892
You were probably paying
as much to hire them

171
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,894
as you were extorting the city for.

172
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,980
So you're saying there's a problem
with my business plan.

173
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,484
Well, could I get something to drink?

174
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:10,239
I'd be more disposed to linguistics
if I weren't so parched.

175
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,284
What do you want?

176
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
Anything carbonated will do.

177
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,122
Don't look so dour.

178
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,499
Mr. Smug'll crack.

179
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,959
It's not the whack job, Lieutenant.
It's Quentin Lance.

180
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,420
As Deputy Mayor, he was supposed
to be here to review plans

181
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,630
for the academy graduation.

182
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,132
-So?
-So his appointment was an hour ago.

183
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
All right. It's okay. I know where he is.

184
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,351
So, get this guy a soda
or something, will you?

185
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,664
[Quentin clears throat]

186
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,874
Hey.

187
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,167
Hey.

188
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,710
Thanks for coming.

189
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,631
You did the right thing texting me.

190
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,884
[scoffs] It's not like
I can call my sponsor, is it?

191
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,469
Why not?

192
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,429
If I tell him

193
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,476
why I wanna drink, what I did,
why I did it...

194
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,522
Yeah, he'd think you were on
something a lot stronger than booze.

195
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,649
It's like all I've got is this guilt,

196
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,611
and all I can do is just run,
run away from it.

197
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,906
And go where?

198
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
To the bottom of these glasses.

199
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,411
Well, you're not gonna do that.

200
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,915
Because you know and I know that
is not what Laurel would've wanted.

201
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,709
Which Laurel?

202
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,922
Perfect.

203
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,300
Open it up for me?

204
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,059
Hey, do you think you can
claim some kinda police brutality?

205
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,855
Not at all. No, I just needed
to get this loose.

We're on a clock.

{\an8}[Oliver] What's the casualty count?

227
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,453
{\an8}Nine dead,
six in critical condition, four injured.

228
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,164
{\an8}Good thing the academy's turning
out a new batch of replacements.

229
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,542
{\an8}-Come on.
-Sorry.

230
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,211
{\an8}[sighs] Look, we might want to consider
canceling graduation

231
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,462
{\an8}or at least, closing it to the public.

232
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,714
{\an8}This city doesn't bend to terrorism.

233
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,133
{\an8}Look, the media's going crazy

234
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,427
{\an8}wanting us to figure out how
we're gonna handle this stuff.

235
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,804
{\an8}We have A.R.G.U.S. connections.
I'll have them handle security.

236
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,181
{\an8}The question is,
who would do this, and why?

237
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,975
{\an8}I think I've got an answer on that.

238
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,977
{\an8}We've got video footage.

239
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,065
Has anyone seen this?

240
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,234
I managed to get to it
before anyone else could.

241
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,862
[John] Thought you said she'd died.

242
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,198
{\an8}You said Black Siren died on Lian Yu.

243
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,616
{\an8}She did.

244
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,493
{\an8}She was dead,

245
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,163
{\an8}buried under a ton of rubble,
when Quentin and I found her.

246
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,416
{\an8}Okay. Well, unless our Laurel is
mysteriously back from the dead,

247
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,835
{\an8}something I wouldn't put past
either of the Lance sisters,

248
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,838
{\an8}Black Siren is not only not dead,
she is not on Lian Yu.

249
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,966
{\an8}Right. And running with
our "old friend" Alex Faust.

250
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,845
{\an8}Okay, clearly he was at SCPD
when the explosion went off.

251
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,513
{\an8}Which means he either died or escaped.

252
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,764
{\an8}He escaped.

253
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,642
{\an8}The question is, why is he
working with Black Siren?

254
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,686
{\an8}And where did they hire these mercenaries?

255
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,188
{\an8}I'll get this image over to Lyla.

256
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,522
{\an8}She can tell us where these guys are from

257
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,024
{\an8}and when they started working together.

258
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,401
{\an8}I promised Raisa
that I'd take William to school.

259
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,195
{\an8}So, I'll check in when I'm done with that.

260
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,739
{\an8}Hey, kiddo.

{\an8}He did not sleep last night.

264
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,209
{\an8}Was he having nightmares?

265
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,587
{\an8}He seemed fine when I left.

266
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,089
{\an8}I think he puts on a good act for you.

267
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,467
{\an8}But when you left with the emergency,

268
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,594
{\an8}he cried about the "bad man."

269
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,347
{\an8}He says the bad man is why
his mother is dead.

{\an8}Slade?

271
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,157
{\an8}You all right, kid?

272
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,742
{\an8}Yeah, I'm fine. Where's everyone?

273
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,078
{\an8}I came back here looking for people.

274
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,872
{\an8}What do you mean, you "came back"?

275
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,833
{\an8}Two of your friends went to
the monastery to look for survivors.

276
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,045
Ra's al Ghul's daughter
went to the cages for that girl.

277
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,130
But your sister...

278
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,049
What about her?

279
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,261
{\an8}Slade...

280
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,972
{\an8}Where's Thea?

281
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,350
She's this way.

{\an8}What do you need?

284
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,317
{\an8}What do I need?
Lots of things, I mean, you know?

285
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,652
{\an8}More out of Rene, for one, you know.

286
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,070
{\an8}He's all right at the new job, but...

287
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,196
He's not Thea.

288
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,031
No, he's not Thea.

289
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,536
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about, um, her.

290
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,037
About Thea?

291
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,207
No. No, the other, uh... Laurel.

when she told you she was dead
when we found her.

294
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,924
Well, it's complicated, isn't it?

-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

supposed to be at SCPD last night,

297
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,894
and I think maybe she went there
looking for me.

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,781
Black Siren and the mercenaries escaped,
but we pulled this off the van.

320
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,199
-GPS?
-Backtrace it,

321
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,035
-figure out where they came from.
-On it.

322
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,413
Dinah, Quentin thinks the attack
on SCPD was targeting him.

323
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,207
Any idea why?

324
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,501
No.

325
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,627
If Laurel was after Lance,

326
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,713
why blow up the precinct after
discovering he wasn't there?

327
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,299
Maybe Quentin was wrong.
Maybe our first instincts were right.

328
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,342
That she's targeting the police
for some reason?

329
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,553
We need to figure out what that
reason is and we need to find her.

330
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,221
[Felicity] Oh, funny you should say that.

331
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,182
GPS' last location was a warehouse,

332
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,975
surprise, surprise, outside of Pennytown.

333
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,602
If this Laurel
is half as smart as our Laurel,

334
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
she would not go back there.

335
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,064
Maybe she left something behind
for us to go on.

336
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,690
-John.
-We are on it.

337
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,949
The blast blew her over there...

338
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,868
[Oliver] Thea?

339
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,677
[sobbing]

340
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,353
[Dinah] Clear.

341
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,646
[John] Clear.

342
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,483
[Dinah] It's all packed up.

343
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,486
Doesn't look like they were planning
on coming back here.

344
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,363
[John] Question is,
where were they headed?

345
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,490
Stay sharp. Look around.

346
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,535
In my experience, bad guys aren't
very good at covering their tracks.

347
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
-[Dinah] You all right?
-Yeah. Why?

348
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,544
Since the bridge, you seem distracted.

349
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,587
Just worried about Rene, that's all.

350
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,842
I saw you take the shot at the merc.

351
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,594
Never seen you miss.

352
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,138
Nobody makes every shot.

353
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,477
What about you?

354
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,606
I don't know.

355
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,275
What about me?

356
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,695
I saw your reaction when Oliver asked
you why Evil Laurel targeted Lance.

357
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,113
And I said I didn't know.

358
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,073
And I didn't find your answer
that convincing.

359
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,575
Really?

360
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,286
[John chuckles]

361
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,915
What the hell is that?

362
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,299
It's a map of City Hall.

363
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,302
With ingress and egress marks
and line of sight.

364
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,678
For an attack.

365
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,972
Why the hell would they want
to attack city hall?

366
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,224
After the SCPD got bombed,

367
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,852
they had to move the academy
graduation to a different venue.

368
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,061
Oliver chose city hall.

369
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,063
That decision was kept
under wraps for security reasons.

370
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,273
How the hell did these guys find out?

371
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,483
I don't know, but we're running out
of time to stop them.

372
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,944
[Dinah] The bombs
really did their work here.

373
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
[Quentin] Yep.

374
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,531
Maybe I should just do this alone, huh?

375
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,450
What, in case you find
my fake daughter dead?

376
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,743
Or alive.

377
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,578
It's all right, I'll be fine.

378
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,167
[groans] What's that,
in case she's not dead?

379
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,002
In case Talia al Ghul isn't.

380
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,004
That's what John gave me this for.

381
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,465
Besides, swords aren't really
my thing. Come on.

382
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,469
[Dinah] You think they knew what
they were signing on for

383
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,304
when they threw in with Chase?

384
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,890
[Quentin] Seems to me they "threw in"
with Nyssa's sister.

385
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,851
Either way, I'm gonna go with "no."

386
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,687
Dinah!

387
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,316
Hi, Daddy.

388
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,984
Laurel.

389
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,446
This might be a late night, Raisa.

390
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,741
I remember when your "late nights"
were more like early mornings.

391
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,578
Thankfully, I've exchanged club openings
for police academy graduations now.

392
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,829
[William] Raisa?

393
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,958
Another nightmare.
I know how to get him back to sleep.

394
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,376
No, I'll get him.

395
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,048
Hey, buddy.

396
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,301
Where's Raisa?

397
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,263
I'm here.

398
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,181
It was just a dream.

399
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,351
The bad man was in my dream.

400
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,062
He's why my mom is gone.

401
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,606
Well, he can't hurt you anymore, William.

402
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,858
He's gone.

403
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,652
No, he's not.

404
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,029
The bad man's here.

405
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,450
Buddy, I'm confused. I'm...

406
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,412
Where do you think the bad man is?

407
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,973
Hey, everything okay?

408
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,391
Worried about William.

409
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,227
-You wanna talk about it?
-I would love to talk about it,

410
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,855
but we have more pressing business, okay?

411
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
-Right.
-Okay.

412
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,025
-Okay, well, I cracked the code.
-Mmm-hmm.

413
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,360
I mean, so to speak. You are welcome.

414
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,697
These are the targeted areas,
which means we can almost be

415
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,324
100% positive Evil Laurel and friends

416
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,743
will be attacking the police academy
graduation tonight.

417
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,161
The question is, why?

418
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,455
Nine dead officers wasn't enough for them?

419
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,873
No, it wasn't.

420
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,376
Because she didn't get who she was after.

421
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,420
-You mean you?
-Quentin.

422
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
Dinah, I appreciate you having my back.

423
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,925
But I appreciate the truth
a little bit more.

424
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,886
Wait, what exactly are we missing here?

425
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,556
You're missing why I told you guys
that Dinah and I found Laurel dead

426
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,308
back on Lian Yu.

427
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,061
Quentin, I don't think
you have to do this.

428
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,353
Yeah, I do.

429
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,232
I've been living with this guilt for
too long. I can't do it anymore.

430
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,736
Bad Laurel,

431
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,074
she wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.

432
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,581
Bad news is that you won't be able
to scream anymore,

433
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,876
but the good news is that you'll be
too dead to care.

434
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,724
I told Quentin
to say she was dead when we found her.

435
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,520
Just spare him the pain
of telling you all the truth.

436
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,272
But the truth is, he saved my life.

437
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,566
The truth is I killed my daughter.

438
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,862
I killed my baby girl.
I just left her for dead.

439
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,155
That's the truth.

440
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,865
She was going to kill me.

441
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,576
As sure as I'm standing here right now,

442
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,954
she was going to kill me
and you saved my life.

443
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,376
-You're staying here tonight.
-I can't.

444
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,128
Quentin, if Laurel's targeting you...

445
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,796
Then she's not gonna stop.

446
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:48,301
And the only way we could stop her is
by dangling me right in front of her.

447
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,304
So, I 'm gonna be there tonight,
front and center, you understand?

448
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,223
All right.

449
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,350
You're at the graduation.

450
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,728
We need SCPD K-9 units
at every entry point.

451
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,273
Actually we can kill the K-9s.

452
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,274
What?

453
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,235
Uh, by kill,
I do not mean kill the actual dogs.

454
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,444
Curtis, what are those?

455
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,114
These are the latest
in high-tech sniffer devices...

456
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,782
Wait, those are bomb detectors?

457
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,243
They can spot as little as
an ounce of explosive material

458
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,369
within a 1,000-foot radius.

459
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,539
Yeah, the only catch is that
we have to be there to operate them.

460
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,915
Which means Curtis and I need
to be on the field,

461
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,334
which means no one will be down here
operating the comms.

462
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,627
I'll do it.

463
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,131
If someone has to take one
for the team, I can do it.

464
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,508
You sure?

465
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,594
Yeah. My gun'll get lost in all that

466
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,762
A.R.G.U.S. and SCPD firepower anyways.

467
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,764
I'll stay.

468
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,349
Okay.

469
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,978
Okay, let's get out there.

470
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,650
We have to get her out of here.

471
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,653
[Samantha] Oliver?

472
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,238
Samantha?

473
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,032
William...

474
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,409
He's fine. Are you okay?

475
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,328
Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,414
Yeah, he's fine. We have to get you
medical attention.

477
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,125
No, I just needed to make sure
that he was okay.

478
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,710
He wants to see his mom.

479
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,339
William needs a parent, promise me

480
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,050
that you will be his father.

481
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,551
I promise.

482
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,392
[sighs]

483
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,276
Curtis, you got anything?

484
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,154
Negative. And shouldn't you be
calling me Mr. Terrific?

485
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,280
I am in the field.

486
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,823
Yeah, but you're not in your suit.

487
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,534
So, no suit, no code name.
Them's the rules.

488
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,412
How about we try to focus instead?

489
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,623
Spartan, what do you see?

490
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,166
So far, so good.

491
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,377
Yeah, maybe they decided
to rethink their plan.

492
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,503
That'd be a smart move.

493
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,588
Haven't seen this many cops
in one place in my life.

494
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,966
Me, either. I'm a cop.

495
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,927
Yeah. Well, doesn't mean they're not
gonna try something.

496
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,345
Everyone stay sharp.

497
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,347
Thank you all for being here.

498
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,016
In light of the recent attacks
on the SCPD,

499
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,185
tonight's ceremony is
incredibly important.

500
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,189
And while we need
to mourn the loss of life,

501
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,858
I feel the need to mention that this city

502
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,653
is better off than it has been
in quite some time.

503
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,154
Crime is down,

504
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,115
our streets are peaceful,

505
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,368
people are not only moving here,
they are staying here.

506
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,744
Do you want to know why?

507
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,747
It's because you help them feel safe.

508
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,375
You have chosen a profession.

509
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,545
One of the most
dangerous professions in the world.

510
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,298
Where, as other people run from
danger, you run towards it,

511
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,842
time and time and time again.

512
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,887
And for that, we all owe you
a huge debt of gratitude.

513
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,348
So, thank you.

514
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,728
Thank you for protecting our families.
For protecting us.

515
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,564
And for our protecting our beautiful city.

516
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,859
-Thank you.
-[crowd applauding]

517
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,652
-Well done, Mr. Mayor.
-Of course.

518
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,572
You keep this up, they're gonna ask
you to run for governor.

519
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,366
Yeah? I'm just glad a bomb didn't
go off during the speech.

520
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,368
Anything from Black Siren and her crew?

521
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,371
You mean the psychopaths I unleashed
on the city? No, not yet.

522
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,498
You can not take that on, Quentin.

523
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,127
And this, speaking as one of the
world's leaders in feeling guilty.

524
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,212
Um, have you ever fired a gun
at your own daughter?

525
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,507
That is... [clears throat]
That's not what happened.

526
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,386
Black Siren is not Laurel.

527
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,846
She is Laurel.

528
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,598
You know it, and I know it,

529
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,893
and we both know that this
"parallel universe" crap is crap.

530
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,064
All right? Every time I see her,
I get that feeling, that instinct...

531
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,358
She's my child.

532
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,652
She's my baby girl, Oliver.

533
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,030
And I tried to kill her.

534
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,532
From what I understand,
you were protecting a friend.

535
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,370
You are not just a good man, Quentin,
you are a good father.

536
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,662
[exhales]

537
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,791
I know, because you are a better
father than I could ever hope to be.

538
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,084
You gotta give it some time.

539
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,710
You've only been at it, what, five months?

540
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,879
-It's not getting any easier.
-Well...

541
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,798
William blames me for Samantha's death.

542
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,424
Why?

543
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,009
Because he's a smart kid.

544
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,346
And he knows what happened,
happened because...

545
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,056
I was involved.

546
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,893
He shouldn't be with me,
he should be with Samantha's parents.

547
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,895
That's not what Samantha thought.

548
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,730
I don't know how to reach him.

549
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,148
Just be his father.

550
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,026
[door opens]

551
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,445
Hey, anything?

552
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,823
Nothing.

553
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,616
Curtis and I
scanned every inch of this place,

554
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,867
something seems really off.

555
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,161
Let's get in touch with Spartan.
See if he saw anything on the cams.

556
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,163
Spartan, you copy?

557
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,082
Yeah. Still here, still nothing.

558
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,292
Maybe A.R.G.U.S. scared 'em off.

559
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,586
Maybe they're targeting Lance another way.

560
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,755
-Maybe he isn't their target...
-[clattering]

561
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,857
[Felicity] [on radio] <i>John?
John, do you copy?</i>

562
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>John, are you okay?</i>

563
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,279
Don't worry, Felicity. John's fine.

564
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,575
He's just gonna be catching up
with an old friend.

565
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,580
Shouldn't you be protecting
the graduation ceremony?

566
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,498
Oh, but what's wrong?

567
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,001
Did you loose your nerve
along with your aim?

568
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,502
I don't know...

569
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,337
You tell me.

570
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,007
[beeping, explosion]

571
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,718
You want me to kill him?

572
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,804
I'm not paying you to keep him alive.

573
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,306
Hey, psst.

574
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,436
Let's get to work.

575
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,107

You're not gonna feel a thing.

580
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,130
I promise.

581
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,632
[groans]

582
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,574
You okay?

00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,744
I'm pissed.

585

Just about finished.

586
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,207
Make sure you put one here too.

587
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,378

God, you are such a bitch.

Yeah, takes one to know one, sweetheart.

Bad news, it's working in the bunker.

[Curtis]<i>Yeah, the whole place is wired.</i>

If you can take the devices, I can
jam the detonation signal remotely.

599
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,717
Is John okay?

600
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,011
I don't know. But I might not be...

I've got eyes on Black Siren.

[grunts]

604
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,531
To be continued...

605
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,871
[Quentin] Don't move.

606
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,916
I said, don't move.

607
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,209
Oh, this feels familiar.

608
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,463
Maybe this time you'll aim for the heart.

609
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,465
I'm sorry.

610
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,051
For shooting me
or for leaving me for dead?

611
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,219
You were trying to hurt my friend.

612
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,556
Oh, so, you choose your friend...

613
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,433
over your own daughter?

614
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,645
Don't make me do this, Laurel.
Please don't make me do this.

615
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,980
So, now, I'm Laurel?

616
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,526
Don't torture yourself.

617
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,489
Because if we were back on Lian Yu,
and the roles were reversed...

618
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,908
I would've pulled the trigger.

619
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,213
Hell of a mess.

620
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,924
Yeah. [clears throat] What's happening
with the graduation?

621
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,300
Went off without a problem.

622
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,970
Unless you count some food poisoning
from the city caterer.

623
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,680
Graduation was a distraction.

624
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,932
Laurel left that map
for me and Dinah to find.

625
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,518
So when did she pivot from targeting
them to targeting us?

626
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,270
Maybe she didn't. I mean...

627
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,023
Maybe the SCPD and the bunker
were her targets all along.

628
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,191
Yeah. Seems pretty random.

629
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
Particularly considering how much
trouble Laurel went through

630
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,069
to make sure we wouldn't be here.

631
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,697
Well, what if planting the explosives
wasn't her objective.

632
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,365
Planting the explosives
was to cover her objective.

633
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,449
Yeah.

634
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,909
What if she was trying to steal something?

635
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,953
Like what? She doesn't need weapons.

636
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,747
Mercenaries she's working with do.
We should inventory the armory.

637
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,250
We should inventory
everything that we have.

638
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,752
If she stole something,
we need to know what it is,

639
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,504
and we need to know fast.

640
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,174
Hey, you all right?

641
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,636
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just glad
that nobody was hurt, you know.

642
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,096
Yeah.

643
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,474
Listen, I'm sorry about lying to you
about what happened on Lian Yu.

644
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,644
Quentin... You don't have
to apologize to me.

645
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,938
I'm sorry that you had to go through that.

646
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,482
When're you gonna stop taking on
everybody else's sins, huh?

647
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,276
No time soon.

648
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,494
How you feeling?

649
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,455
Oh, like a million bucks.

650
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,664
Yeah?

651
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,585
All right, maybe more like
a couple of hundred, but...

652
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,919
I'm alive, right?

653
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,964
Dr. Schwartz would like you in here
for a few more days.

654
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,340
I feel good.

655
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,552
Besides, when have I ever
listened to anybody?

656
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,221
Not to get too personal,
but what would happen to Zoe

657
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,140
if something happened to you?

658
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,808
Not much.

659
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,854
She's got her
new family now, hoss. I mean...

660
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,023
She probably doesn't even think about me.

661
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,484
She's your daughter, Rene.
Of course she thinks about you.

662
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,985
That ship's sailed.

663
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,488
I blew that chance months ago.

664
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,448
Chase blew that chance for you.

665
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,744
One of many reasons why I think
you deserve another one.

666
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,335
I tried getting another hearing...

667
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,961
Yeah, you're not the mayor.

668
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,802
-You got me another hearing?
-Not just me,

669
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,553
the new DA had something to do with it.

670
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,847
Okay. All right.

671
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,349
[coughing]

672
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,227
Thank you, Oliver. I owe you one.

673
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,937
Pay me back by getting better.

674
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,188
Copy that.

675
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,441
Hey, kid.

676
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,320
Hello, Slade.

677
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,073
How is she doing?

678
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,575
She's the same.

679
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,495
What are you doing here?

680
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,000
I popped by to say that the intel
that you gave me on my son, Joe,

681
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,586
it panned out.

682
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,298
So, I'm heading to Calgary.

683
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,175
Well, that's great. I'm very, uh...

684
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,303
I'm happy for you and I hope that...

685
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,098
I hope you find what you're looking for.

686
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,058
You don't think I will?

687
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,728
[clears throat]

688
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,233
I think that finding your son
doesn't always go as planned.

689
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,986
Have things been that hard
with you and your son?

690
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,157
Be patient.

691
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,826
But be prepared.

692
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,995
For what?

693
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,039
Choosing between being the man

694
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,917
that people need you to be,

695
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,920
or the father

696
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,297
that your son needs you to be.

697
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,134
What do you mean by that?

698
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,136
You and I

699
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,556
walk between two worlds.

700
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,895
But we can only do that for so long.

701
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,735
Good luck,

702
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,904
Mr. Queen.

703
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,739
Good luck, Slade.

704
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,970
[exhales in pain]

705
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,018
-[Dinah] You okay?
-[sighs]

706
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,104
Yeah, I'm good.

707
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,065
Anything missing?

708
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,359
No. All's accounted for.

709
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,028
Including your gun?

710
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,739
Not that you seem to be using it
that much these days.

711
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,745
I, uh, checked it
after the fight down here.

712
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,372
You checked my gun?

713
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,832
You didn't even fire it.

714
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,084
And none of the guys
down here got hit, either.

715
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,420
[John] Yeah.

716
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,046
Dinah...

717
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,306
[Curtis] I found it.

718
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:33,019
By found it, I mean I found
what Laurel... Black Siren took,

719
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,355
which is more like not finding
anything at all. You get my point.

720
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,151
What? No, I'm not sure we do.

721
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,862
She took one of my T-Spheres.
A prototype version.

722
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,031
A prototype? Meaning it's not weaponized?

723
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,616
Well, then they can't use it against us.

724
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,577
Question is, what can they do?

725
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,495
[helicopter blades whirring]

726
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,859
Hey, buddy.

727
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:31,994
William, I know that the last few
months have been difficult for you.

728
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:37,458
And I know that you blame me
for a part of that.

729
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,044
[Oliver sighs]

730
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,297
I used to blame my dad for things...

731
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,175
Well, he wasn't perfect.

732
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,095
Neither am I.

733
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,391
But he loved me.

734
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,686
I know how much your mom loved you.

735
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,814
She really did.

736
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,650
But you need to know the last thing that

737
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,694
she asked of me was to take care of you.

738
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,908
Now, you don't have to like me
for me to take care of you,

739
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,077
because I'm your dad.

740
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,665
The way that works is,
I'm going to be there for you,

741
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,458
whether you want me to be or not.

742
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:24,088
I'm never, ever walking away from you.

743
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:36,016
There's a game on tomorrow
if you want to stay up late, watch it?

744
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,273
Football or baseball?

745
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,654
Baseball.

746
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,657
Okay.

747
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,413
Okay.

748
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,336
[phone vibrating]

749
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,342
Hi, I was just gonna give you a call.

750
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,011
Turn on Channel 52 right now.

751
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,846
Okay.
