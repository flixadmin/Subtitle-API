they're new.

to break them in yet. - Shut up.

is as powerful as they come,

I mean, no.

02:00:48,325 --> 02:00:50,026
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2241
02:00:50,059 --> 02:00:51,362
I don't know who
you're talking about.

But I'd like to meet that person

'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2244
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:57,600
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2245
02:00:57,633 --> 02:00:59,235
but, like, in a dangerous way.

2246
02:00:59,268 --> 02:01:01,170
What the hell
are you talking about?

2247
02:01:01,204 --> 02:01:03,306
Relax. We know who you are.

- How?
- Don't worry about that.

Who are you guys?

Don't worry about that either.

Look, we've seen
what you can do.

And we're here
to make you an offer.

Well, I mean, not this exactly.

2258
02:01:20,323 --> 02:01:21,357
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2259
02:01:21,391 --> 02:01:22,558
in the dream, but...

2260
02:01:22,592 --> 02:01:24,160
- Ew.
- Huh?

2261
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:26,329
Well, that was easy.

2262
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:27,996
Welcome to the Justice Society.

02:01:28,029 --> 02:01:30,031
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

The Justice Society?

2265
02:01:31,334 --> 02:01:32,635
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2266
02:01:32,668 --> 02:01:34,404
Yes. The Justice Society

2267
02:01:34,437 --> 02:01:35,971
is different
than the Justice League

2268
02:01:36,004 --> 02:01:37,640
because of how words work.

2269
02:01:37,673 --> 02:01:39,609
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2270
02:01:39,642 --> 02:01:42,043
- So, that's you guys, right?
- No.

2271
02:01:42,077 --> 02:01:44,045
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2272
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:45,980
He's joking, right?

2273
02:01:46,013 --> 02:01:49,251
- No?
- Okay. I'm out.

I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

Can you drive by and get me?

[SHAZAM] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2277
02:01:55,757 --> 02:01:57,192
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2278
02:01:57,225 --> 02:01:59,227
two separate groups
of superheroes

2279
02:01:59,261 --> 02:02:00,662
that are totally unaffiliated,

2280
02:02:00,695 --> 02:02:02,731
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2281
02:02:02,764 --> 02:02:05,032

about doing a rebranding of sorts?

02:02:12,741 --> 02:02:14,509
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2286
02:02:14,543 --> 02:02:16,076
These are, like, legal terms.

but a trick of the mind?
