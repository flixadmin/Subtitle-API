00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,534
You are smart. You are funny.

650
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,578
What's there to worry about,
right?

651
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,163
They're gonna love you.

652
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,958
Thanks, Gru.

653
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,169
Buh-bye.

654
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,215
Oh, please let them love you.

655
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,259
(sighs)

656
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,844
(gasps)

657
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,097
Hey, Poppy.

658
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,020
Uh...

659
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,022

-(yells, stammers)

660
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,732
-(horns continue honking)
-Move it!

661
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,400
(chuckling):
Sorry. My bad.

662
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,862
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

663
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,990
Ooh. Glassos.

664
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,534
(chattering, laughing)

665
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,494

(muffled chattering)

678
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,896
All right, gentlemen, fall in.

679
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,775
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

680
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,610
-MINION: Uh...
-MINION 2: Si.

681
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,612
As you may or may not know,

682
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
I was recently called out
of retirement

683
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,325
to head up the AVL's
new top secret initiative

684
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

685
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,621
And that's where you come in.

686
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,289
We need volunteers.

687
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,999
(all shouting, laughing)

688
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,502
We are looking for the strong,
the mighty...

689
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,753
-Oh.
-Uh...

690
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,088
-...the fearless.
-MINION: Uh, nope.

691
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,799
-We need the best of the best.
-Uh...

692
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,802
-So, who's it going to be?
-(Minion chuckles)

693
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,471
(Minions murmuring,
chuckling nervously)

694
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,931
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

695
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,141
-Uh, blumach.
-(sighing)

696
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,476
(laughter)

697
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,019
The AVL is known

698
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,313
for cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

699
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,358
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents,

700
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,654
and I can think of no better
guinea pigs than you.

701
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,280
-Guinea pig! Yeah!
-(laughing)

702
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,532
(blows raspberry)

703
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,743
You will be the first
to test our Super-serum,

704
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,246
designed to transform you
into elite agents

705
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:31,042
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

706
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,629
Or you might just explode.

707
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,423
We don't really know.

708
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,757
Uh, uh, huh?

709
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,467
(whimpers, yelps)

710
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,177
(screaming)

711
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,179
Ah... (chuckles)

712
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,225

724
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:22,135
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

-(yelling, roaring)
-(Minions whooping)

727
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,853
(laughing):
Cool!

728
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,063
Aw, you guys look adorable.

729
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

730
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,568
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

731
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,069
Hi-yah!

732
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,906
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

733
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,116
-That's the spirit. Oh!
-(gong clangs)

734
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,578
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

735
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,581
Blair and Britney, right?

736
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,291
-Mm...
-We will!

737
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,084
Okay. Bye, Mom.

738
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,544
-LUCY: Bye!
-(kids grunting)

739
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,670
Gotcha.

740
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,422
Hi-yah!

741
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,174
Circle up, people.

742
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,802
(grunting fiercely)

743
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,054
Show respect for your sensei.

744
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,265
KIDS:
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

745
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,059
Hai!

746
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,857
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

747
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,609
You look like a sheepdog.

748
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,027
Sorry, Sensei.

749
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,779
(Agnes whimpers,
chuckles nervously)

750
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,572
Now, we have
two new students today

751
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,619
ready to begin their journey--
hi-yah!-- to awesomeness.

752
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,955
-You, tiny girl.
-(gasps)

753
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,332
Step forward
and tell us your name.

754
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,875
Um...

755
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,169
(whispers):
It's Britney.

756
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,671
Uh...

757
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,965
m-my name?

758
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,968
I can't...

759
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,637
There's no "can't" in karate.

760
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,014
Ten push-ups after class!

761
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
Hey, that's not fair.

762
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,143
(grunting)

763
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,813
You better not be talking back
to your sensei.

764
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,398
(grunts fiercely)

765
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,318
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

766
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
Mm...

767
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,989
I guess not.

768
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,991
Then why don't you go sit

769
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,410
in the corner
of disgrace and reflection

770
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,454
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

771
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,338
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

772
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,048
Yeah, probably.

773
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,383
-Excuse me?
-(neck cracks)

774
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,052
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

775
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,972
you picked the wrong dojo.

776
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,142

You broke my pinkie toe.

(Edith chuckles nervously)

789
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,876
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

790
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,169
(Edith chuckles nervously)

791

-Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

795
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,887
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

796
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,805
Well, what can I say?

797
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm good at what I do.
(chuckles)

798

Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,640
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

814
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,226
(chuckling): Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

815
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,937
No, no, no, no,
that style is dead to me.

816
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,731
It's-it's time for
a whole new Melora.

817
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,900
I want this.

818
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,777
Wow. (chuckles)

819
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,154
Wow. Um...

820
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,117
Okay. Let's start with color.

821
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,995
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

822
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,832
A little of this.

823
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,625
Some of that.

824
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,043
And, ooh, that's pretty.

825
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,712
This isn't so hard. (chuckles)

826
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,755
(sizzling)

827
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,549
Uh...

828
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,346
What?

829
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,474
(sniffs)
Should it be smoking?

830
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,767
Yes, uh-huh.

831
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,602
Smoking means it's working.

832
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,688
(chuckles, gasps)

833
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,189

836
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,195
-(gasping)
-What's going on?

837
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,281
Perfect. No one panic.

838
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,575
Call 911!

839
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,536
-(people screaming, sobbing)
-(fire alarm ringing)

840
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,707
Quickly, quickly.

841
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,792
-(fire truck horn blasting)
-Oh. (chuckles)

842
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,544
Wonder where they're going.

843
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,296
(frantic chatter)

844
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,716
(laughs) Voilà.

845
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,384
My latest creation.

846
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,971
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

847
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,473
Ay, I love it.

848
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,558
Oh, and look at
the little antenna.

849
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,559
That's so cute.

850
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,561
It's not supposed
to be cute, no!

851
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,606
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

852
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:31,027
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking bald potato,

853
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,362
-and his baby is mine.
-(laughing)

854
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,531
-Check this out. (chuckles)
-(alarm chirps)

(laughing maniacally)

859
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,964
No, I kid you not. I'm being...

860
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,424
Whoa!

861
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,219

(groans)

867
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,750
Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

868
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,127
I changed your diaper.

869
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,003
I've got your bottle,
your Binky.

870
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
And here are your balloons.

871
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,590
-There you go.
-(giggles)

872
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,509
-You like those, right?
-(fussing)

873
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,928
All right,
a little bit of me time.

874
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,638
(sniffs deeply)

875

(exasperated sigh)

888
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,964
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

889
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,633
Ugh, teenagers are the worst.

890
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,971
Yeah, babies are no picnic,
either.

Hello, Gru.

Hello. Wha... Hey.

What. What the...

912

Oh. Hello, Poppy.

Did you say something?

Wha... My name's Chet,

(laughing): Wha...
What does that even mean?

918
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,171
It means you're bad at lying.

Hey, that's not nice.

920

I don't respect boomers.

Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

937
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,171
Because you're gonna help me
pull a heist.

We start planning tomorrow.

939
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,758
You want to pull a heist?

940

-Ow.
