Hey, Harry, all of your friends

156
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,290
- are in this room.
- I have other friends.

157
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,520
You asked me to make new friends.

158
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,140
I made new friends. It was a task.

159
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,490
- I complete tasks.
- That's so great.

160
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,500
- I can't wait to meet them.
- Harry, you listened to me.

161
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,450
- I'm so proud of you.
- Okay, there's no pride...

162
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,950
Put that down.
Look, my friends are smart.

163
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,140
They'll help us. I'll call them.

164
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,350
All right, well, um, in the meantime,

165
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,410
we gotta find the rest
of these bus metas.

166
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,610
Somehow they're connected
to DeVoe's plan.

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,740
Well, I was in between drunk

- She's in jail.
- When are visiting hours?

172
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,730
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font> What about vibing

the rest of the bus passengers?

174
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
I mean, I-I tried, but, you know,

175
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,430
the... the dark matter we released

176
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
was such a massive space-time event

177
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,610
that my energy just reflected back

178
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,440
and I ended up vibing myself.

179
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,270
I'm pretty sure I relived my own birth.

180
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,430
Or was that my death?

181
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,450
You know, there are other
non-traumatizing ways

182
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,080
of bringing Ralph's memory back,

183
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,120
- like hypnosis.
- Is that really a thing?

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,090
I mean, not the whole
cartoon, pocket watch version,

185
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,520
but yeah, real hypnosis can be used

186
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,730
to recover memories.

187
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,960
All right. Do you know any hypnotists?

188
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,130
- Mm-mm.
- Not me.

189
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,170
- You lost me at “cartoon.”
- All right.

190
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,470
So who's gonna hypnotize Ralph?

191
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,210
I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

192
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,070
Dr. Finkel, thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

193
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,570
Our friend Ralph here is having trouble

194
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,170
remembering information...

195
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,870
for a detective case. Right, Ralph?

196
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,690
So...

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
I see you didn't go to Harvard.

198
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,090
No. Did you?

199
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,570
I see what you did there.

200

201

that'd be great.

202

So, another bus meta?

How can this possibly be... possible?

to leave a psychic imprint on objects...

376

377

378
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,680
That's really smart, 34-25-34.

He was an auctioneer at Wetherby's.

388
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
He was transporting
a Native American artifact

We just don't know which one.

Oh, wait. Maybe we do.

A bison necklace.

392
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,320
Ralph, you said you saw
a bison on the bus, right?

393
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,460
I mean... nothing in our world
is a coincidence.

394

According to this auction report,

397

the necklace was separated
into three pieces.

398
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,510
The first was in the briefcase,
the third is unknown,

399
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,760
but the second was in the hands
of a private collector.

400
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,170

- I'll get the CCPD.

Get his address. He may be in danger.

402
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,540
Then we better pay him a visit.

Out of all the artifacts in the office,

471
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,390
she could only control the knight.

472
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,130
So then maybe
her psychic imprint abilities

473
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,230
are just restricted to effigies.

474

475
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,260

- Yeah, I don't know.

476
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,670
Sounds kinda dirty to me.

477
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,710
So if the statues look like people

478
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,670
or animals, she can bring them to life.

479
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,260
- Mm.
- Good thing there's only

480
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,790
thousands of those in the city.

481

Oh, I got a hit on facial recognition.

482

“Mina Chaytan, professor
of cultural anthropology”?

483
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,970
- She's a teacher?
- Was.

484
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,800
She became an activist,
but she lost her job

485
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,300
six months ago after being arrested.

486
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,970
Breaking and entering,
trespassing, burglary...

487
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,970
quite an activist.
The charges were dropped,

488
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,740
but the university still let her go.

489
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,610
She was trying to reclaim
several Sioux art pieces

490
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,450
from the museum. Chaytan was at this

491
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,180
even before she was a meta.

492
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,450
Yeah, except now she's
upped her game to homicide.

493
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,150
She wants the third piece
of that necklace?

494
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,320
- Let's find it before she does.
- Okay.

495
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,190
West and West are on the case.

496
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,720
What's wrong with you?

497
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,740
You let her get away.
We could've caught her.

498
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,900
Yeah, I let her go,
but I also saved Banks's life.

499
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,100
That was the most important
thing in that situation.

500
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,670
Really, Allen? Because to me,

501
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,640
when I was a cop, getting the bad guy...

502
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,610
that was the most important thing.

505
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,410
All right, look, Ralph.

506
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm always gonna make the decision

507
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,250
to help the person in danger first.

508

I still think the best thing we can do

515
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,560
is figure out what is DeVoe's goal.

516
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,870
And then from there, we can track all...

517
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,230
<font color="#ff00ff">[SCOFFS]</font> That's a simple plan

518
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
from a simple man.

519
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,040
- That's not helping.
- Why don't we use

520
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,840
the Bates-Novick method first?

521
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,670
We determine why each meta
developed their super powers...

522
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,280
and then we smash them to bits.

523
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,940

No, we can't even agree
on what methodology to use.
