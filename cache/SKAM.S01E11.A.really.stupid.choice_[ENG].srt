1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,460
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,860
Call me when you've figured that out.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,420
You just made out a bit?

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,660
- It was your boyfriend who tipped me off.
- Did Isak send the tip?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,420
I think it's completely psycho!

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,820
Do you have feelings for me?

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,100
As if you didn't know.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,240
- Want to go to my place to do homework?
- No.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,630
Let me know when you change your mind.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,100
- What are you doing on your plate?
- I'm just sorting my salad.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,060
I'm not on the bus anymore.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,100
She started staggering, and then she tripped.
She's not responding.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,820
I think I killed William's baby tonight.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,010
SHAME

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,380
You kept pushing me out of bed.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,710
SATURDAY, 10:21 A.M.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,220
- You pulled away my comforter like ten times!
- It was cold!

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,340
- Yeah, I know!
- Sorry...

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,160
Is your mom never home?

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,460
She is, but she got a new job
at the Ministry of Environment, so

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,260
ever since that she's been traveling a lot more.
So she's home only every other week.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,040
- You're home alone a lot! Isn't that cool?
- Sure is.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,770
You can do whatever you want.

24
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,820
- Where's your dad?
- He lives in Bergen.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,880
- Chris! You get to clean that up.
- Yeah, I'll clean it up.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,910
Dad lives in Bergen,
since mom and dad are divorced.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,090
- I think we moved from Bergen when I was twelve?
- Do you have any contact with him?

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,340
No... yeah, I have.
But we kind of lost contact when we moved.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,860
Dad got remarried,
and his wife was a bit jealous.

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,660
- Hi!
- Hi!

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,280
Hi.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,680
- We made breakfast.
- Yeah, Noora made pancakes.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,580
Yeah, let's eat.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,620
You can sit here.

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,580
- Have some pancakes.
- It smells really good!

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,940
Just start! Sana?

37
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,300
Do you want some juice, Vilde?

38
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,290
Here!

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,900
Oh, shit. I just spilled a bit.

40
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,740
Do you want some jam with that? So you can...

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
I can't remember anything from yesterday.

42
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,540
It doesn't matter. It'll be fine.

43
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,840
Blackouts are God's way of telling you that
you don't need to worry about anything, Vilde.

44
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,540
You did nothing special.

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,940
You just passed out,
when you came to Iben's party.

46
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,740
So we brought you here. And then you just slept.

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
Vilde...

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,040
every girl with self-respect
has blacked out at least once.

49
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,930
Thank you.

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
I mean it.

51
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,370
You don't have to thank us. That's why
we're on a bus together. To help each other.

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,470
You still want me on your bus?

53
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,940
What are you talking about?
You're our bus boss!

54
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,530
You think any of us want to do
the financials and the budget?

55
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,590
But... it can be a bit stressful as the bus boss.
I mean...

56
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,820
if it interferes with other things.
That could happen fast.

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,700
- Yeah, like what?
- Well, like school and...

58
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,500
things like recreational activities...

59
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,540
or...

60
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,860
children.

61
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,040
Vilde...

62
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,110
are you pregnant?

63
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,740
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

64
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,860
How sure?

65
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,020
Yeah... yeah, yeah.

66
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,180
We'll probably have to take
another little trip...

67
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,750
to doctor Skrulle, then.

68
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,830
MONDAY, 1:39 P.M.

69
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,340
- It's quite captivating.
- Who are you talking about?

70
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,720
Justin... your crush.

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,780
- Eva, that's between us.
- You have to look, look here!

72
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,800
- Yeah, yeah. I've seen that.
- Yeah, it's probably hanging over your bed.

73
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Hi!

74
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Hi.

75
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,750
The stage group invites you
to the Christmas tree lighting on Friday.

76
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,590
Are you coming?

77
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,140
- Maybe...
- You have to. The entire school will be there.

78
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,180
- Okay, we're coming.
- Good!

79
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,220
- Hey... he's hot!
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. I've seen it.

80
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Hi, beautiful.

81
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,050
Willhelm! Wow.

82
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,190
You're not answering my messages?

83
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,570
I ran out of battery.

84
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,020
For two weeks straight.

85
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,360
Want to skip the next class?

86
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110
- You have to give up now.
- Give up?

87
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,780
I'm not going to give up.

88
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,420
You're wasting your time.

89
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,790
Listen, Noora Amalie SÃ¦tre.

90
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,240
You're a smart girl, and you have to realize
that every time you reject me...

91
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,320
it only makes me want you more and more.

92
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,780
So if you really want to get rid of me,
just go on a date with me.

93
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,350
Stop acting like you're so damn interesting.

94
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Great logic.

95
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Was that all, or?

96
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,710
No, one more thing.

97
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Fuck, you're beautiful.

98
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,180
Just tell me what I should do, then!

99
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,620
- Hi...
- Hi.

100
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,430
- We should probably have a talk.
- Yes.

101
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,800
When can you talk?

102
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,930
I have lots to do this week.

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,760
And I really need to study,
unless I want to fail in all my subjects.

104
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,540
- But... Thursday maybe?
- Thursday is fine.

105
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,930
What's up with you guys?

106
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,980
He's in love with me.

107
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,680
- You're kidding!
- No, it's--

108
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,040
THURSDAY, 10:30 A.M.

109
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,630
Hi, there!

110
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,880
Hi. Hi, hi.

111
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,990
There we go, she's new. Salaam Alaikum?

112
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,950
Vilde is pregnant!

113
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,680
Oh... that went fast.

114
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,670
Vilde Lien, what should I say? Congratulations?

115
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,760
- She's not going to keep the child!
- We don't agree on that.

116
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,190
She's sixteen years old!
She's way too young to be a mother.

117
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,030
Well, not that young, the world's youngest
was 5 years and 7 months, that's young.

118
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,140
But she wasn't from Norway.
She was from some place in South America.

119
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,670
I want to say Chile.

120
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Or was it Peru?

121
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,280
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi. Yes.

122
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,130
- What should we do?
- Yeah,

123
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,560
what should we do? We need to start with...

124
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,450
- taking a blood sample.
- I took a test.

125
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,570
- When did you take the test?
- I took it last Friday.

126
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,110
Last Friday?
And have you had sex since Friday?

127
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,790
- No!
- Are you really sure?

128
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,480
There were a few hours
where it went a bit black...

129
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,060
Okay, girls. This here is an ovulation test.

130
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,470
An ovulation test?

131
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,390
This means that if you
haven't had sex since you took it,

132
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,290
you're most likely not pregnant.

133
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,170
Really?

134
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,560
But there's other things as well,
I'm sick in the mornings, and...

135
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,290
I have a pretty bloated stomach.
It's gotten a lot bigger.

136
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,000
It probably hasn't grown all that much,
but I can take a look. Let me see.

137
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,510
Yeah... okay...

138
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,630
- Does this hurt?
- Yes.

139
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay...

140
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,160
- How's your diet?
- Good.

141
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,520
- What did you eat today?
- It's still really early, so a Cola Light...

142
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,180
and a piece of gum.

143
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,780
Yeah, got it.

144
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,580
Vilde, I don't think
there's a baby in your belly.

145
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,580
It's probably just
air in your intestines.

146
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,930
That happens when you cram down
Cola Light and gum all day â

147
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,870
you produce more gas.
Do you fart a lot?

148
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,950
- No.
- No?

149
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,850
You should. Because you're
pushing up too much air in your intestines.

150
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,330
That gives you a stomach ache,
so you have to fart it out.

151
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,710
In the worst case we have
to give you a colostomy.

152
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,190
You know, a poop bag on your stomach?

153
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,510
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not.

154
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,570
But you can't live on Cola Light and gum.
That's my point.

155
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,120
Yes! We're not having a baby!

156
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm so relieved!

157
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,990
Vilde...

158
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,530
I see what you're doing.

159
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,820
And you have to stop.

160
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,450
You don't really know
what you're talking about.

161
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,130
Yes...

162
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,070
I do.

163
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,270
Not to be rude... but you stuff yourself
with chocolate milk and pancakes,

164
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,170
and you look like a super model.

165
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,660
What are you talking about?

166
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,760
You look like a super model.

167
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,670
Vilde, you're super pretty.

168
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,180
But not pretty enough.

169
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,370
THURSDAY, 2:23 P.M.

170
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
Isak...

171
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,450
I need you to be completely
honest with me now.

172
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,890
Yeah.

173
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,360
Because if I don't believe you...
I'll ask Jonas.

174
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,310
And then I'll tell him why I'm asking.

175
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,650
I understand.

176
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,890
When we were at the cabin...

177
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,520
I asked you if you knew
if Jonas and Ingrid were texting...

178
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,720
I...

179
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,470
I knew he... texted... with her
because of her brother.

180
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,420
So it wasn't about French?

181
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,650
No.

182
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,180
Well, maybe that too, but...

183
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,580
I remember Jonas was stressing like crazy
about getting weed for the cabin trip, but...

184
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,960
He couldn't reach her brother,
so... he sent her a message instead.

185
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,100
Huh?

186
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,470
You guys were smoking at the cabin?

187
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,260
Yeah, that's why Elias came,
because Jonas couldn't get any before we left.

188
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,110
Not to criticize you...

189
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,060
but we were pretty high.
I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

190
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,360
Okay.

191
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,360
Anyway.

192
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,000
What about that other time? When I...
thought I heard Ingrid over the phone.

193
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,390
And I asked you.

194
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,730
Did you know anything about that?

195
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,250
No.

196
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,490
I could imagine that it was because...

197
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,190
he wanted to reach her brother.

198
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,240
But...

199
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,000
I had promised Jonas not to tell...
you anything about him... about him smoking.

200
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,070
So... I kept my promise.

201
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,940
But you advised me to ask Ingrid?

202
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,840
That was shit advice.

203
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,660
Plain and simple.

204
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,610
I should've just told you that you...

205
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,660
shouldn't worry about her.

206
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,460
That he was more in love with you than...

207
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,740
ever.

208
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,840
It would have been pretty cool
if you had told me this earlier.

209
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,890
One more thing.

210
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,820
If you wanted to fuck things up
between me and Jonas...

211
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,500
why didn't you just advise me
to tell him about Chris?

212
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,100
I knew that if you told Jonas,
he would have forgiven you.

213
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,740
Don't you get how messed up that sounds to me?

214
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,650
Suddenly it feels like I don't know you anymore.

215
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,780
I know it might be...

216
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,510
hard to believe,

217
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,370
but I never wanted to hurt you.
It just turned out that way.

218
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,890
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Karma is a bitch.

220
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,290
If nothing else...

221
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,350
I finally understand what it was like for Ingrid.

222
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,780
Hi!

223
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,410
Hi!

224
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,260
- How's it going?
- Good.

225
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,020
What are you doing?

226
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,300
- Just some Christmas shopping.
- You don't like Christmas shopping.

227
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,180
Who was that?

228
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,690
It was my sister.

229
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,370
Okay...

230
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,480
I swear!

231
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,580
Okay, I believe you.

232
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,450
Good.

233
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,530
- But...
- Yeah?

234
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,940
Remember that you told me to call
when I had figured out who I am?

235
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,490
Yes.

236
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,380
Do you want to meet?

237
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,740
Yes, of course. When?

238
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,930
No, you're probably going to smoke marijuana
with Ingrid's brother...

239
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

240
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,420
How about tomorrow?

241
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,730
Yeah, tomorrow is fine.

242
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,930
That's good.

243
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Talk to you later. Bye.

244
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,060
FRIDAY, 2:32 P.M.

245
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
- Tea?
- Yeah.

247
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,530
That was warm.

248
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,320
Do you remember the first time we kissed?

249
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,340
- What? Why are you laughing?
- Of course I remember that.

250
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah? What do you remember?

251
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,860
What do I remember?

252
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,370
- Yeah. What is it?
- It's a bit embarassing.

253
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
No. Say it.

254
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,220
The thing is that I didn't know
if you were feeling the same as I was, right?

255
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,260
And since you were best friends with my
girlfriend, it was a pretty big risk to take.

256
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,960
If it hadn't worked out,

257
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,610
it would have been really embarassing.

258
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,480
So I just... I waited for a sign.

259
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
What kind of sign?

260
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,180
A sign that I should kiss you.

261
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,910
And...

262
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,730
You know that song "Take Me to Church",
that was playing all the time?

263
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,010
Yes.

264
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,900
I figured that if that was the next song
that came on, then I'll go for it.

265
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,360
- So did it come on?
- No, it didn't.

266
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,460
They played this Kygo shit...

267
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,190
But then it was you who kissed me.

268
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,840
It was me who kissed you.

269
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,530
What you didn't know,
was that I was thinking the exact same thing.

270
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,710
Oh, yeah?

271
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,150
I was thinking...

272
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,450
- I need a sign.
- Yeah?

273
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,390
"If the next song is by Kygo,
I will kiss you."

274
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
So funny.

275
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,420
But...

276
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,960
that wasn't really why you kissed me,
was it?

277
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,420
No.

278
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
That wasn't why.

279
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,060
I kissed you because I couldn't help myself.

280
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,890
It wasn't like...

281
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,450
I got together with you
just because it seemed cool.

282
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,250
No?

283
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,220
No.

284
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,110
And... you accusing me of that...

285
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,220
actually made me pretty angry.

286
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Because it felt like I had to
give up everything, just to be with you.

287
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,900
I ditched my best friends.

288
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,650
So, you telling me that I'm just
doing what others think is cool...

289
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,230
and that I don't have my own opinions,

290
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,470
that's so damn unfair.

291
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,340
Because it's not true.

292
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,550
Because I chose you.

293
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,470
And it was...

294
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,240
a really stupid choice.

295
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,890
But at least I didn't do it to be popular.

296
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
A really stupid choice?

297
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,650
Yes.

298
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
A really stupid choice.

299
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,120
Because it made me feel like shit.

300
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,420
All this time I was paranoid that there
may have been something between you and Ingrid.

301
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,670
I thought that...

302
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,750
if you and I could do
something like that to Ingrid...

303
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,820
then you could do the same thing to me.

304
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,870
Do you understand?

305
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,110
Maybe...

306
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,960
I thought that I deserved it.

307
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,400
And then I just became...

308
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,320
insecure and...

309
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,200
desperate.

310
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,050
Your opinions meant more than my own.

311
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,040
And it shouldn't be like that.

312
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,230
No.

313
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
So I need to...

314
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,020
figure out what my own opinions are.

315
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,820
And I have to do that on my own.

316
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,210
Are we breaking up now?

317
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,140
I think so.

318
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,410
Is that what you want?

319
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,450
Yes.

320
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Right now...

321
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,580
this seems like the most important thing.

322
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,180
As if nothing else has meaning.

323
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,540
We'll just stay here then.

324
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,170
- Hello.
- Hi.

325
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,890
Me and Jonas broke up.

326
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,750
I just thought I should tell you.

327
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,650
Are you okay?

328
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,080
- Hi!
- Hi!

329
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,260
- Have you seen Vilde?
- No.

330
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,600
But, she was coming?

331
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,730
Yeah, I think so.

332
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,100
- Okay, can I borrow your phone?
- Yes, of course.

333
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,540
I'm out of battery.

334
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:52,410
In 2015? Doesn't anyone have
a working piece of technology?

335
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,260
Thanks.

336
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,510
- You're welcome.
- Can you unlock it?

337
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,000
- Do you have Vilde's number?
- No, I don't.

338
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,050
- Hi!
- Hi!

339
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:16,760
- I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
- Yes, Merry Christmas, Ingrid!

340
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,340
- Vilde!
- Hi!

341
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,060
- Hey... Noora is looking for you like crazy.
- Why?

342
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,510
She's probably afraid
you've blacked out somewhere.

343
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,340
Very funny!

344
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,220
Vilde?

345
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,780
- Hey.
- Hi.

346
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,150
Do you remember when I said
you weren't pretty enough?

347
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,470
That was bullshit.

348
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,740
You're more than pretty enough.
Anyone who says otherwise is an asshole.

349
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,400
And that includes me.
Okay?

350
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,410
Okay.

351
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,060
What just happened?

352
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,260
I have to tell Chris and Sana!

353
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,940
Hey, I found Vilde.
You'll never guess what just happened--

354
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,680
Hey, I was just thinking. Remember when you
told me you thought it was a bit weird

355
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,690
when Isak said
he has feelings for you.

356
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,920
Yes?

357
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,180
Because...

358
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,180
I just think that...

359
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,530
that maybe it's not you
he has feelings for.

360
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,740
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

361
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,440
five, four, three, two, one!
