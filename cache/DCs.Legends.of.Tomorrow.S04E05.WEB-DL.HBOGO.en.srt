00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,400
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,080
Your shape shifting
days are over, sweetheart.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,240
He decided to exploit her
for information

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,960
and to help us track down
other Fugitives.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,600
I know you're writing a novel
and it's really good.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,520
Taco delivery. My name's Mona.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
So, what's a Time Bureau?

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,360
That was supposed to be top secret.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
I'm not losing another kid.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,440
The magic he used
was pretty powerful.

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,040
If magic has him on death's door,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,920
then maybe magic can save him.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,280
I think I know someone who can help.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,480
{\an5}There's got to be
another way to fix him.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
Something Gideon missed.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
{\an5}John used magic to save
those kids at the camp.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,920
{\an5}Magic's the only
thing that can fix him.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
And you really think
Nora Darhk is the answer.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,440
She's the only witch I know.

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,320
Can we even find her?

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,640
That is the problem.
She has a time stone.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,600
{\an5}She could literally
be anywhere or any-when.

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,600
The Bureau can't seem to find her.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
You know, when I was a kid,

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,360
{\an5}there was this one escaped
con that my dad was after.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,440
{\an5}And everyone assumed
that he had fled the country.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
You know where he found him?

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,360
Not a block from the police precinct.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,520
Do you really think she's hiding
in the Bureau's backyard?

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,480
{\an5}Gideon, do a Nora Darhk
facial recognition scan

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
of 2018.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,760
<i>I have located a potential match.</i>

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
That's her.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Right in the Bureau's backyard.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,640
Great work, Detective Lance.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,840
{\an5}<i>Captain, our systems
have identified the presence</i>

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>of a new Fugitive.</i>

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,360
<i>This one is in 1951 Tokyo.</i>

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,320
All right, let's divide and conquer.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,320
I'll go take care of Tokyo
you go find our witch.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,720
Make her fix our warlock.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,200
{\an5}<i>Everybody to the bridge.
We got a Fugitive alert.</i>

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
<i>Hello? Can anyone hear me?</i>

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
- Crap!
- Hey.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,360
Closed door means stay out.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Sorry, Sara called a team meeting.

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,320
- Were you...
- Yes.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
I was watching porn.

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
On a typewriter?

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Hey, no judgment here.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,200
{\an5}All right, <i>Andiamo los case.</i>
Chop! Chop!

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
'Oy, enough shouting.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
That my whiskey?

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
It was.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,600
{\an5}Oh, well, look
who finally pried themselves

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,360
away from their important business.

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
Look, hobbies are very important.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,880
Right, Rory?

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
I take my porn very seriously.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
Okay, back to work.

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
In the summer of 1951, a film
screw shot footage of a monster

62
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
in Tokyo Bay.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,440
Two days later,
the city was destroyed.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,320
We need to get that footage
before any panic sets in

65
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
and to capture that monster

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
before it can do any real damage.

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,640
And because we're shorthanded,
you're up.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
Time to earn your keep.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,480
Oh, I didn't ask to be here, Mum.

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
But you are a Fugitive.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,520
So, your choices are help us out,

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
go back in your cage.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
Bloody humans.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,320
All right, fine.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,800
{\an5}But it's only to stop you
blinkered lot from giving

76
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
a harmless monster
a one-way ticket to hell.

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,040
At least with me there,

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
the poor chap gets a fair shake.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
I like her. Yes. I like her.

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
{\an5}As you can see, Mr. Heywood,

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
{\an5}the Time Bureau is putting
your money to great use.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
{\an5}We now have multiple teams
deployed throughout history

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
tracking down and securing Fugitives.

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,960
All trained by your son.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,840
{\an5}We only have the most highly
qualified Time Bureau personnel

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,400
dealing with... oh, boy. And...

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
Here's Gary with a live one.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh, say hello to Baba Yaga.

89
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,920
We caught her trying to
eat Chinese gymnasts

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
at the 2008 Olympics.

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
- Sorry about that, sir.
- What did she say?

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,800
Just a typical Russian greeting.

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Are you sure this room
is secure enough

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
to hold these creatures?

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a temporary arrangement

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
until our containment facility
is up and running, sir.

97
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
And they're heavily sedated,
right, Gary?

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,200
{\an5}Yup. Double doses of elephant
tranquilizer all around.

99
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
This way.

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
Well, Director Sharpe,
looks like you have

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,320
things under control here.

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes, sir. We sure do.

103
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,200
I'll be seeing you tomorrow
for Thanksgiving.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,920
Your mother's really looking
forward to it and so am I.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,520
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
What are you doing
for the holiday, Director Sharpe?

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Me? Oh, well I was planning
on spending it

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
with my girlfriend,
but she's working overtime.

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,760
So, I'll probably just be
sticking around here, I guess.

110
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,480
You should join us.
It'll be fun, right, Nathaniel?

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,840
- Absolutely. Absol...
- Bye, sir.

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
{\an5}Yeah, that is if you don't
mind starving all day

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,480
{\an5}while your family slowly
gets loaded and starts fighting

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
and then your dad gets called
for a "work emergency."

115
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, at least your family
are real people.

116
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Mine are actors.

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
According to historical record,

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,520
the director we're looking for,

119
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,160
Ishiro Honda,
should be in this stage.

120
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
Oh, I'm feeling a little conspicuous.

121
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,640
Just ask like you belong.
No one will question it.

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
You. Coffee, now.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
- <i>Hai.</i>
- Yeah, see?

124
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
It's all about confidence.

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
All right, you guys know your cover?

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Yup.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,360
I beg your pardon,
but this is a closed set.

128
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Are you Ishiro Honda,
the film director?

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,760
Honda-san, pleasure to meet you.

130
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
We're Producers from K&G Pictures.

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,720
We got word of an unusual
animal sighting out in the bay.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,440
We were told that you might
have some footage suitable

133
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
for our news reel.

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
How do you know about that?

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,840
We're from Hollywood.
We know everything.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh, gracias.

137
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,000
You must have misheard.

138
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,680
We were out on location
by the sea, yes,

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,640
and we saw a whale,

140
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,200
and that was it.

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,480
You're sure it wasn't something else?

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,960
Something strange?

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,400
Perhaps we can take a look
and see for ourselves.

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm afraid the footage
was ruined during transport.

145
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,360
<i>It truly is impossible.</i>

147
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,040
Nah, bloke's lying.

148
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh, finally. Something we agree on.

149
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,760
- Stay here.
- What? Where are you going?

150
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,000
To find that film.

151
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, not if I find it first.

152
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
I have to go now.

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,480
Mr. Honda? Mr. Honda?

154
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,880
Could... could
we trouble you for a tour?

155
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
Of course, please.

156
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
When we are on a mission,
I give the orders.

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Whose rubbish idea was that?

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,640
You are lucky
I am a reformed assassin.

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,280
It's quite a remarkable effect.

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,080
If we shoot at low angles
with a wide lens,

161
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,200
it feels as though we are ants
in this enormous city.

162
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
That is fascinating.

163
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,280
It's got to be
in his office somewhere.

164
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
If I was hiding something,

165
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,120
I would put it where
no one else would look.

166
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Like under a bloody bomb.

167
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Genius.

168
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
It'd look amazing on fire.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,360
Thank you so much for the tour.

170
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,120
If you are ever in Burbank,
be sure to look us up.

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
<i>I've successfully digitized the film
and it's ready for viewing.</i>

172
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
Roll it, Miss G.

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
What is that under the water?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Guys, I think we're going
to need a bigger time ship.

175
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,160
Okay, what is it?

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,200
You're supposed to be
the Fugitive expert.

177
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, well that's no Fugitive.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
So what, it's just
some other magical monster

179
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
that's not supposed to be here?

180
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Maybe you just haven't met this one.

181
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Or maybe if you weren't
so quick to blame us Fugitives

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,280
for everything,
you'd see the more likely scenario.

183
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
That creature is man-made.

184
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
It's probably a mutant or something.

185
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,320
Created by one of the countless
nukes you humans dropped

186
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
on the Pacific in this era.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,360
Or didn't you think of that?

188
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Nice try, genius,
but if that were true

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
we wouldn't have got a magic alert.

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,320
So, why are we here?

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,480
Oh, you're the time traveler.

192
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
Why don't you figure it out?

193
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Okay. Gideon,

194
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,520
scan Tokyo Bay for any
unusual marine activity.

195
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

196
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,560
Hopefully Ray's having better luck.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
I had a dream like this once.

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Maybe more than once.

199
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,200
More mead, wench.

200
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,360
As you wish.

201
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, a thousand pardons.

202
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
A Palmer Tech phone?

203
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,840
Great software.

204
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Terrible hardware.

205
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
My phone!

206
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
Get ye out of my sight, scoundrel.

207
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
- What?
- Oh.

208
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm just... What are you doing here?

209
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,640
- I need your help.
- What?

210
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,440
Chris and Tyson,
you two get back here right now!

211
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,920
- Hi, Nate.
- Hey, Patty.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,440
- This is...
- Hey...

213
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Ava Sharpe.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,120
Hi, Grandma!

215
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,760
That's my grandma, Violet.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Do not let her rope you
into playing cards.

217
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,040
It's a lose-lose situation.

218
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,960
And there's my Uncle Rich.

219
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't mention Obama.

220
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,120
- There he is.
- Hey!

221
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Good to see you, son.

222
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
Glad you could make it,
Director Sharpe.

223
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,440
- Thanks, sir.
- You must be Ava.

224
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

225
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,240
Thank you so much
for letting me join you.

226
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,440
Oh, of course.

227
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,080
We wouldn't want you all alone
on such a special day.

228
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
He's into the good stuff.

229
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,680
Nate, show her around.
Make her feel at home.

230
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,360
- Wow.
- Wow.

231
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Oh, your family seems nice.

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
Oh, it's still very early.

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay, everyone,
the turkey is almost done...

234
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
- Wait for it.
- Brining.

235
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,920
Yeah, it just has to sit
for another hour and a half

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
and then I'm going to pop it
into the oven.

237
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
So, that means dinner is when?

238
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,480
- Give or take six hours.
- What?

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,240
Oh, my God.

240
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,480
- Tyson!
- Buckle up, Ava Sharpe.

241
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

242
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,560
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Green.

243
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
Hi, Mona.

244
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Thanks for bringing me
food on a holiday.

245
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
It's literally my job.

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,160
Why are you working on
Thanksgiving?

247
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,720
What's the Time Bureau do anyway?

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,680
It's like Groundhog Day.
Oh, we regulate time zones.

249
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,920
So, you got any plans
for the big meal?

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
Heck yeah, I do.

251
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
My family's in LA,
so it's just me, instant ramen,

252
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
and Bestflix binging.

253
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,480
Oh, well, if you want you could,

254
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
have Thanksgiving with me.

255
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,280
That's really sweet, Mr. Green.

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,920
But I don't want to eat all
of your food.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Oh, I happened to have
ordered enough for two.

258
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,760
You're vegetarian, right?

259
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,560
Nora Darhk, what the blooming
hell are you doing here, eh?

260
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
I owed this guy a favor.

261
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,480
She shouldn't be here, mate.
I thought I warned you.

262
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Can you help him?

263
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,200
Gideon is showing strange
marine activity in this area.

264
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,360
Fish disappearing on masse,
seismic tremors...

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Do you need all that just to end up
back where the film was shot?

266
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Just being thorough.

267
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,680
Using fancy toys instead
of your noggins, more like.

268
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,800
You know, I think I liked you
better when you were in a cage.

269
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,120
All right. Enough.

270
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
All we got to do is draw
this thing out,

271
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,040
we shrink it down,
and we're good to go.

272
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,600
And how do you expect us
to do that?

273
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,640
We'll just summon it with
a friendly call?

274
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,800
"Oy, monster, come up here.
Promise it's not a trap."

275
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
Or feed it like that guy.

276
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,760
Isn't that our friend
the film director?

277
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,240
- Feeding the whales, Mr. Honda?
- What?

278
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
You. What are you doing here?

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You first.

280
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Start talking.

281
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
What the hell is that?

282
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,400
It's evil.

283
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,560
Truly evil.

284
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,080
I think we found our Fugitive,

285
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,320
but it's not a monster.

286
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
No.

287
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
This is something much, much worse.

288
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,200
This, chaps, is no ordinary diary.

289
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,880
It's an agent of Brigid.

290
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,720
Brigid.

291
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
The Celtic goddess of art,
creation, and healing.

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,520
This book has the power
to make the imagination...

293
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,960
a reality.

294
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,200
You are not film producers, are you?

295
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,640
No, we are not. But we saw
what was on that film, Ishiro,

296
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,040
and we're here to stop it.

297
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
Tell us how you found the journal.

298
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,440
I was out scouting for my film.

299
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
And I found this book.

300
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,280
You didn't find the book
it found you.

301
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,760
It's drawn to creative types.

302
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
Once I opened it,

303
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I was flooded with inspiration.

304
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,280
An image that has honed
in my nightmares.

305
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,440
Suddenly came to life on those pages.

306
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,120
And then to my horror...

307
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,720
in real life.

308
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,120
I told you this book is evil.

309
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
Whoa, hold on a tic.

310
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,960
Brigid created this book
as a gift to you humans.

311
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,400
To bring your dreams to life.
You turned it into a weapon.

312
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
She's right.

313
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,440
I did create something horrible.

314
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,160
- What is this thing?
- I call it Tagumo.

315
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,480
A giant land octopus.

316
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,400
Capable of destroying entire cities.

317
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,880
When I realized Tagumo
had come to life,

318
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,720
I tried to destroy the journal.

319
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
But it always comes back.

320
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,640
Of course it does.
The power links you in this book.

321
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,840
It won't be released until
the story of your creation

322
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,480
is played out in full.

323
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
How did you end it?

324
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,720
You pushed the octopus
in a volcano?

325
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Nope.

326
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,240
Tagumo wins.

327
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,880
Tokyo is destroyed.

328
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,560
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, Rich!

329
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,200
You break it, you bought it, Rich.

330
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
Well, this is a disaster.

331
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,160
Hey, no one's killed each other yet.

332
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,200
Chris? Tyson?

333
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
Dad, have you seen the boys?

334
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Oh, last I saw them,
they were down in the basement.

335
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,000
Playing with Nate's old air rifle.

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mom!

337
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,640
Guess they know how to load it.

338
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Wow.

339
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,400
Okay, if we can't stop Tagumo,

340
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
then draw a new ending.

341
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,520
Preferably one where no one dies.

342
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,000
It's not working.

343
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,880
Like I said,

344
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,000
Brigid created that book

345
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,760
to help artists express themselves.

346
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,160
You can't expect him
to write a happy ending

347
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,440
if he ain't had a happy life.

348
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,800
Ain't that right, Ishiro?

349
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
You're right.

350
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,600
Every night,
before this journal came to me,

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
I'd close my eyes

352
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,000
and be back
in the ruins of Hiroshima.

353
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Choking on ash, wondering
where all the people went.

354
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,440
Not realizing they were
all around me in my hair,

355
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
on my clothes,

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
in my lungs.

357
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,160
They turned to dust.

358
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,240
Drawing Tagumo helped me
turn the nightmares

359
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
into something I could understand.

360
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
A monster.

361
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,240
But now I am the monster.

362
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Ishiro, you went through
something truly unimaginable.

363
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,160
We all deal with our pain
in different ways,

364
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
and you chose art.

365
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,560
And that's beautiful.

366
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,760
Don't blame yourself.

367
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,080
This is not your fault.

368
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,800
So, can you save him?

369
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Life force is the most potent
form of energy in the universe,

370
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
and you're like a battery
about to run out of charge.

371
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

372
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,280
Then why didn't you say anything?

373
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,280
What? And help push you
off the wagon?

374
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,480
You're clean, Nora.
It's best we keep you that way.

375
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
You can recharge him, right?

376
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,440
You don't want me to do that, Ray.

377
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes, I do.

378
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600
- Otherwise, he's going to die.
- Ray.

379
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,040
My power comes from my father.

380
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,480
It's in my blood.
It's always going to be calling me,

381
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,200
wanting me to give in
and be consumed,

382
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
but I can't give in.

383
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
I won't.

384
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,360
Now this is where we monitor
time zone infractions.

385
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
Isn't that a little overkill?

386
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
No, here at the Time Bureau,

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,440
there's no such thing as over kill.

388
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,120
You need to come with me.
Come, come, come.

389
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,240
There's something else amazing
to see right in here.

390
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
- Why are you...
- What? Yup.

391
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,800
Oh, Gary? Hello?

392
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
I... I think you forgot to unlock
the door.

393
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,440
I am so fired.

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Sorry to bother you,

395
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
but we have
a bit of a situation in here.

396
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,040
The prisoners are loose.

397
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,440
What? How the hell did that happen?

398
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,680
The tranqs must've worn off.

399
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
- Okay, we need to go.
- No, no, no.

400
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
We leave, Hank will know
something's wrong.

401
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,360
Something is wrong, Nate.

402
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,600
<i>So, you want our liaison to the DOD</i>

403
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,880
knowing that we messed up?

404
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,760
- No, I don't.
- What do I do?

405
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880
Shut up, Gary.

406
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,800
- All right, I got a plan.
- Okay.

407
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,080
- I'll be back.
- No, no, no.

408
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,440
Your family's going
to notice that you're gone.

409
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,920
Not if I courier back ASAP.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
- Oh... no.
- Just stall.

411
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
- No, no.
- Stall!

412
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
No, I don't even know... I...

413
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,040
Hey, buddy, you okay?

414
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,440
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

415
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
- Yeah, scary stuff.
- Yeah.

416
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,880
But, like I said, I have a plan.

417
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,280
So, let's go get our hands
on some tranq guns.

418
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,840
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

419
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
- Is that a Kaupe?
- No.

420
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,680
What the hell is she doing here?

421
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,240
She was supposed to stay
locked in the closet.

422
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,760
I was going to flash her later.

423
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,120
- What?
- That didn't sound right.

424
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh, for the love of...

425
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
Excellent hiding spot.

426
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
Yeah, well, I'm not hiding.

427
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
My father sacrificed himself
to give me a second chance.

428
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,120
I don't want to ruin it by
backsliding into dark magic.

429
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,000
Who says it has to be dark?

430
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,520
John needs a magical transfusion.

431
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,240
Normally, I'd have to drain
someone's life to save his.

432
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,680
Well, life force
is essentially energy.

433
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,200
- Right?
- Yeah.

434
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,320
Well, then I have an idea.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh, look at this.

436
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,000
Look at this.

437
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,360
Dot, you have outdone yourself.

438
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,560
I hope you all built up an appetite.

439
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,360
Care to do the honors
this year, Nathaniel?

440
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Nathaniel?

441
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
Oh, he... he's probably
just in the restroom.

442
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,760
- We should wait for him.
- Mom, I'm hungry.

443
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,080
Me too.
Just a little bit longer, boys.

444
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
Oh, I'll go check on him.

445
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
Oh, wait... sorry, sir.

446
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,920
Do you know what
we would do in my family?

447
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,080
We'd actually go around
and list all the things

448
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
that we're thankful for.

449
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
What a lovely idea.

450
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm thankful I'm still breathing.

451
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,520
Well, I'll go first then.

452
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,880
I am thankful for so many things.

453
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,080
So many... many things.

454
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,680
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here.

455
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
This is, like,
the coolest place ever.

456
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Wait.

457
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,400
I've seen this before.

458
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,640
They're hangry.

459
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,640
These poor creatures
are starving to death.

460
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,080
What does a Kaupe, Chupacabra,
and a Baba Yaga eat?

461
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,680
That'd be Hawaiian BBQ,
Birria, and Veal.

462
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,920
Babies, more precisely,
but veal will do in a pinch.

463
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
- Really?
- I read a lot.

464
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Wow.

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
Where are we going to get all
those things on Thanksgiving?

466
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
- I'm on it.
- No, get back here.

467
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,200
Ishiro can't change the story.

468
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Plan C it is.

469
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,720
What if we got the book
to bond with another artist?

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
We could change the story altogether.

471
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,920
Do you see another artist around?

472
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
It's not like you can
just find some rando

473
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,680
with a paint brush.

474
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
Who knows what they could unleash.

475
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,080
And we're sure there's not
a single artist amongst us?

476
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Why don't we just burn
the damn thing?

477
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,640
Hey, why don't you tell Sara
you're a writer?

478
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Because I'm not.

479
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,320
Rory, I read your novel.

480
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,320
As much as it pains me to say it,

481
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,800
you are very, very talented.

482
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,400
Well, it doesn't matter.
I can't write anymore.

483
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Nothing comes out.

484
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
You have writer's block.

485
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,400
No, I dropped a deuce this morning.

486
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Guys?

487
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
What is happening?

488
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
The Tagumo...
it's headed straight for us.

489
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,080
It's moving fast.
It's getting closer.

490
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,640
- By land?
- It's in the sewers.

491
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
Like an octopus,

492
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,640
Tagumo can squeeze through
the tiniest opening.

493
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
It's coming for me.

494
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
We're not going to let that happen.
Rory, Z? Keep him safe.

495
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Charlie, with me.

496
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,280
What's the plan?

497
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
You distract it I'll shake it down.

498
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,720
What? You want me as bait?
Not bloody likely!

499
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,320
Charlie! Damn it.

500
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,520
Get your slimy mitts off of her,
you wanker!

501
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,720
Yeah!

502
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,320
Come more over here, you muppet!

503
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,480
Come and get me!

504
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah!

505
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,400
Bloody brilliant!

506
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,160
Aren't you glad that I came back?

507
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Where did it go?

508
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
Sara, how's it going out there?

509
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,720
<i>Good news, we shrank Tagumo.</i>

510
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Bad news, we have no idea
where it went.

511
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Dez.

512
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,200
- Nora, don't.
- Don't talk.

513
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,600
- Save your strength.
- Nora, listen to me.

514
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Listen to me.

515
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
As smart as Ray is,

516
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,240
he doesn't understand
what you're about to do.

517
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Choosing a life of magic,

518
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,880
you're either all in or you're not.

519
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
There's no half-measures.

520
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
And you and I both know

521
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,840
it never leads to a happy ending.

522
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,600
So, if you're going to do this,
you don't do it for Ray.

523
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,040
You don't do it for me.

524
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,920
You do it for yourself, all right?

525
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,040
It's your choice.

526
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
It's your choice.

527
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
It's your choice.

528
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,640
And I am thankful for the new
Whole Paycheck grocer

529
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,760
by my work, you know?

530
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,440
Did you know they have
a full bar? And...

531
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,200
And I think you mentioned
everything the rest of us

532
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
are thankful for.

533
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,880
So everyone, please, grab a plate.

534
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh! We should say Grace, right?

535
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
Grace!

536
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
I'll check on Nathaniel.

537
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,680
That... just...

538
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,920
Why couldn't I just tell sober,
grounded stories

539
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,400
instead of indulging
in silly monsters?

540
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
Sober and grounded is boring.

541
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,080
You had a story to tell
and you told it.

542
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,800
You brought that monster to life.

543
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,200
Don't pretend for a second
you're not a little bit proud.

544
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
I was so afraid
of what people would think

545
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
of my creation.

546
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,640
And now
that it's here in the flesh...

547
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,520
Story complete.

548
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,520
And I no longer have to fear

549
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,560
what was locked inside my head.

550
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
No.

551
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
No, you don't.

552
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Pen.

553
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,240
The ink... it's not disappearing.

554
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Are you ready?

555
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Yes.

556
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
I want to do this.

557
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Oh, what a rush.

558
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
Mona's here with the food.

559
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Listen...

560
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Oh, crap.

561
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,560
Come on out, son. Time to eat.

562
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
You know, maybe we should
just start without him.

563
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm sure he'll be out soon enough.

564
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh, look at that.
Maybe, maybe he went to the store

565
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,040
to grab some Pepto for you know.

566
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,760
I'm going to ask you
this once, Director Sharpe.

567
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,200
What are you hiding from me?

568
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,920
The prisoners have escaped, sir.

569
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,080
My son is alone with those
creatures on the loose?

570
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,360
- You take me there now.
- Sir, it's not safe.

571
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
My son is not safe, Director Sharpe.

572
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,640
We're going. End of discussion.

573
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,480
What the hell is this?

574
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, dinner.

575
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,160
The key to any
hangry creature's heart.

576
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,800
We let them fill up and then it's...

577
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
night-night again.

578
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,160
This time, without the
life-threatening shenanigans.

579
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,360
Señor, I couldn't find the Tapatio,

580
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
but here's some Sriracha.

581
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,600
- What are you doing?
- Quiet, I'm concentrating.

582
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,760
Mick is a writer.

583
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,240
The journal has bonded with him.

584
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,280
Bloody hell. That's it, we're doomed.

585
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,560
We cannot stay here.

586
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,600
Tagumo will find us.

587
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Ishiro!

588
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,960
Meet Garima. Queen of Thanzanon.

589
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,760
- Should we help her?
- No, no, no.

590
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
I think she's got it.

591
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Get it, girl!

592
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Yeah!

593
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,440
It's beautiful.

594
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,320
Hi, I'm Mick.

595
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,600
"With the monster vanquished,

596
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,160
"Garima and her beloved Buck
made passionate love

597
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,040
in the ruins of the city."

598
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay. Let's go. Now.

599
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,080
Where is everyone?

600
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,080
Your compatriots
grew tired of waiting.

601
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,120
Oh, sorry about that.

602
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,600
Got a bit messy in there.

603
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm going to take this with me.

604
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, please.

605
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,480
It clearly likes you.

606
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,560
Your creation was magnificent.

607
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
I was thinking about a fourth boob.

608
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Three was plenty.

609
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,400
Listen, Honda-san,

610
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,240
forget about the octopus.

611
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Lizards.

612
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,080
Lizards are king.

613
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
This girl can drink.

614
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Care for a nip?

615
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,960
I know it won't quite
make up for the bottle...

616
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,760
bottles that I pillaged.

617
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,480
It's a start.

618
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Look,...

619
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,960
I wasn't too keen on what
you were doing out there.

620
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,240
Hunting Fugitives.

621
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
But if someone's got to play copper,

622
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,480
it is a small comfort knowing
that she has a heart.

623
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Don't tell the others.

624
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
They'll never listen to me again.

625
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,120
I should've known
you'd had an eye for talent.

626
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
Just like your old man.

627
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,480
Your creature handler, she's great.

628
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,440
Oh, yeah, she's gonna...

629
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
She's gonna fit right in.

630
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Hey, look, Nate.

631
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,640
I just wished you told me
what was going on.

632
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,360
Honestly, I thought I could
put out the fire

633
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,560
before anyone noticed.

634
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
Oh, now I know how
you must've felt

635
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,520
all those times you had to duck
out of the family gatherings.

636
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,760
You're the guy they called
if there was a disaster.

637
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,080
And I may have also
been looking for a way

638
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
to get out of the house.

639
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,320
- You old so-and-so.
- Sir.

640
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
I know what you're thinking,

641
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,080
but I can assure you
this will never happen again.

642
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
You're damn right it won't.

643
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm going to green light
additional funding

644
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,160
to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.

645
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,680
Well, thank you so much, sir.
That will help a lot.

646
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,720
And your mother is gonna kill us.

647
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
Not necessarily.

648
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,760
Perks of time travel.

649
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,320
We can portal back
into the second after we left.

650
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,160
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

651
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,720
Let's make like a tree and leave.

652
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,080
Not sure that's how it goes, but...

653
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,320
- How are you feeling?
- Hunky-dory, love.

654
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
You know, in fact, I feel like
I have a new lease on life.

655
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,880
How are you feeling?

656
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Better.

657
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,720
You know, my whole life,

658
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,600
I always believed my power was evil,

659
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,120
and then my dad died,
and I feared using it.

660
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,280
But I saved you,

661
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,880
and for the first time in my life,

662
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,800
my magic doesn't scare me.

663
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Good.

664
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
John.

665
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,320
That man I saw.

666
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Who was he?

667
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
The past.

668
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Hooray.

669
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,080
Hey, cheers, big man.

670
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,880
And now I am gonna go and satiate

671
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,840
my most wonderful habit.

672
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Gonna have a smoke.

673
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
What? No, no, no.

674
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,840
Don't ruin it. We just cured you.

675
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,960
I can't believe that worked.

676
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,800
Well, I for one always...

677
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
Always want to see the best
in people.

678
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Even me.

679
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah.

680
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,480
I should be one my way.

681
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,240
- Yeah.
- Okay.

682
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,320
Run.

683
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
As far as you can.

684
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,360
Don't tell me when and where.
Just go and stay hidden.

685
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,120
But your team will know
you let me go.

686
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,600
- Again.
- And I don't care about that.

687
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,040
I care about you.

688
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,720
And I want you to be free.

689
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,680
This is the Time Bureau.
Nora, what are you doing?

690
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,000
You got to get out of here.

691
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,960
I can't keep running.
You want me to be free?

692
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,120
Repentance is my path to freedom.

693
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,400
It's time for me to pay for my past.

694
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,280
Nora Darhk, hands up.

695
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,640
Get on the ground.

696
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Get on the ground!

697
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,000
<i>You can lay on the long side</i>

698
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,800
<i>Wherever you'll be someone</i>

699
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,200
<i>Staring out at the bayside</i>

700
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,200
<i>If you need me, just throw your gun</i>

701
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,720
<i>Going out with a head start</i>

702
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,520
<i>And kissing you in the pouring rain</i>

703
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,040
<i>We can live on the outside</i>

704
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,160
<i>Or we can live in America</i>

705
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,600
"Garima was as strong
as she was stunning,

706
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
"and with her by his side,

707
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,320
"Buck had at last vanquished
his true enemy.

708
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
Fear."

709
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,800
<i>Playing games with the lawman</i>

710
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,880
<i>High telling it's time to run</i>

711
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,200
<i>Riding out in the sunset</i>

712
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,800
<i>Screeching tires we hit the road</i>

713
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,520
All right.

714
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,400
It's okay, Dad. Take it.

715
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Take it.

716
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,920
Oh, look at this.

717
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,400
Thanks for getting back to me.

718
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,400
I know it's hard to get away
during the holiday.

719
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,360
The creatures are controllable.
I've seen it.

720
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,960
I don't care how much it costs.

721
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,600
We're going to make this happen.

722
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,120
Project Hades is go.
