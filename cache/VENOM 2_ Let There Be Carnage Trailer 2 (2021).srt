1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,025
All I ever wanted in 
this world is carnage.

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:12,510
Eddie... We should be out there, 
snacking on bad guys.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,524
I am a predator.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,181
I need to be free.

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,269
You have got to get control 
of your aggression...

6
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,999
or we will get hauled off into Area 51.

7
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:31,718
You live in my body, you live by my rules.

8
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,836
I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me,
please, let me fix it.

9
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,194
Sorry to break it again..

10
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,305
you are a loser.

11
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:46,443
Eddie Brock, I want to give you my story.

12
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:47,390
Inside the mind of serial 
killer Cletus Kasady.

13
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,692
People love serial killers.

14
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:52,280
Cletus, why me?

15
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,665
What's mine is yours,

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,704
and what's yours is mine.

17
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:06,479
I have tasted blood before,
and that is not it.

18
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,156
All I ever wanted in this world..

19
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,069
is carnage.

20
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,793
I'm not a crazy man.

21
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:44,278
Really I'm a vengeful one.

22
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:49,926
Oh, Shit!

23
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:53,644
Whoa, where you going?

24
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,509
- That is a red one.
- You need to come out right now.

25
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,105
I will let you eat everybody.

26
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:00,264
- Promise?
- Promise.

27
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,192
Oh, yeah!

28
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,145
Eddie...

29
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:08,656
you feel like home to me,

30
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,770
like family.

31
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,221
Oh, wow!

32
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:23,784
You could just say 
"I'm happy for you."

33
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,307
That was going to be us.

34
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,808
I'm happy for you.

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,903
No!

36
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:30,712
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Not sorry.

37
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,899
These two need some 
serious couples counselling.
