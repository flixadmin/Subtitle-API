[miners bleating]

00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,440
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,527
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

[screaming]

15
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,177
Hmm?

16
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,346
[growling]

17
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:04,642
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

18
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,935
It can't be.

19
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:06,894
[growls]

20
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,103
[miner] Tai Lung.

21
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,856
I have returned to take what is mine.

22
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:14,151
Which is everything that is yours.

23
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,779
[all screaming]

24
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:17,988
[all gasp]

25
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,201
[all gasping]

26
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,623
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

27
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:30,793
and no one will stand in his way.

28
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:34,797
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

29
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:43,847
[children laughing]

30
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,766
Oh, where is Po?

31
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,519
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

32
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,522
Ping, will you please just relax?

33
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,482
I am relaxed!

34
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:56,193
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

35
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,779
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

36
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,406
- What if he's hungry?
- [whimpers]

37
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,157
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

38
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:06,704
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

39
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,211
Kung fu!

40
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,506
Whoa! That's bad.

41
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,384
Whoa! Getting worse.

42
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,803
Whoa!

43
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,639
[grunting] Ah, come on!

44
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,852
[grunts]

45
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:31,729

00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,238
[grunts]

48
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:44,825
[screaming] Ha-ha!

49
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,541
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

50
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:06,639
Whee!

51
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,141
- Oink.
- Oink.

52
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,226
- [cheering]
- Again, again!

53
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:12,144
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

54
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:16,981
[chuckles] And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

55
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:18,692
[pigs cheering]

56
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,990
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

57
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,075
[villagers cheering]

58
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,410
- [villager] The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

59
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,038
Was, is and always will be.

60
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,915
[fan 1] We love you, Dragon Warrior!

61
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,542
And I love you too, adoring fan.

62
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,126
- [fan 2] Sign my scroll.
- [fan 3] Sign my hat.

63
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,294
- Sign my shirt.
- [Po] Okay, okay.

64
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:38,712
I'll sign whatever you want.

65
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,589
Po!

66
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,716
Master Shifu!

67
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,343
Here, let me just--

68
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,805
There, that's much... worse.

69
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,140
We have to talk.

70
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,018
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

71
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,104
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

72
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,397
What ceremony?

73
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,858
- [Po] The Staff of Wisdom.
- [fans] Ooh.

74
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,652
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
- [fans] Aah.

75
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,821
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

76
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,782
has the power
to travel between the realms.

77
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,702
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

78
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,121
And now, the power to open...

79
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:16,917
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

80
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,669
[cheering]

81
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,048
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

82
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,550
[cheering]

83
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:27,219
- [grunts]
- [party whistle toots]

84
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,554
Dragon Warrior!

85
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,681
Will the Furious Five be here too?

86
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,057
Unfortunately, no.

87
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:34,727
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

88
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,188
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

89
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:39,398
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

90
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:41,233
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

91
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,610
- [crocodilians] Crane!
- [Po] <i>Long story.</i>

92
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,487
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

93
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,447
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

94
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,740
<i>And Mantis?</i>

95
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,784
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

96
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,413
Just 'cause they're not here in person

97
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:57,082
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

98
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:00,169
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

99
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,962
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,632
[piglet] My turn! My turn!

101
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,716
And then you.

102
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,510
[villagers gasp]

103
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,804
[groans]

104
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,557
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

105
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,767
We need to talk.

106
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,436
- Now.
- [villagers gasp]

107
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,522
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

108
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,856
- [Shifu] Po!
- Coming.

109
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:22,942
[Po panting]

110
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,320
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

111
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,115
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

112
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,617
Yes, but you persevered.

113
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:35,871
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

114
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,790
The next step?
What are you talking about?

115
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,167
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

116
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,962
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

117
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,380
Successor for what?

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,800
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

120
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,179
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

121
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:56,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

122
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,645
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

123
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,605
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

124
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,274
Once a successor is chosen,

125
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,402
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

126
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,488
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

127
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,866
Whoa.

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,326
I don't know what that means.

129
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,745
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

130
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:21,375
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

131
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,627
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

132
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:27,256
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

133
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,175
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

134
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,343
[muffled] A cookie.

135
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,636
Other hand.

136
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,346
The Staff of Wisdom.

137
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,348
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

138
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,684
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

139
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,935
Or pose for pictures?

140
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,687
He wasn't super specific.

141
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:45,983
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

142
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,944
and become something better
than you already are.

143
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,196
[Po] You take it.

144
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,823
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

145
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:56,285
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

146
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,578
and am at peace with.

147
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,622
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

148
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,249
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

149
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,417
This is an honor.

150
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,546
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

151
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,341
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

152
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,134
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

153
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,303
No one is taking anything away, Po.

154
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,847
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

155
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,600
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,352
The "shasha-booie"?

157
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,853
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

158
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,523
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

159
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,566
All I know are two things.

160
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,903
Kicking butt and taking names.

161
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,989
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

162
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,157
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

163
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,660
I wanna say Steve...

164
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,994
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

165
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:44,333
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

166
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,502
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

167
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,838
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

168
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,007
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

169
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,176
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

170
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,053
and Master Oogway chose you.

171
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,014
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

172
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,517
Candidates? What candidates?

173
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:03,936
[villagers cheering]

174
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,737
Awesome!

175
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,162
No way!

176
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:26,834
Wow!

177
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,878
Skadoosh.

178
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,296
Fantastic pose.

179
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,507
[screaming]

180
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,681
[villagers applauding]

181
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,683
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

182
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:49,190
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

183
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,069
[villagers chanting]
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

184
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,073
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

185
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,201
So many great candidates.

186
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,204
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

187
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,373
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

188
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,250
What is happening?

189
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,587
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

190
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,256
[groans]

191
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,008
[screams]

192
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,137
[Shifu] Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

193
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:24,099
[chewing] Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

194
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,809
You will know when you know.

195
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,604
How do I know when I know?
You know?

196
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:29,647
[sighs]

197
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,067
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

198
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,319
Just as Oogway did before me.

199
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,364
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

200
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,573
What is that you're holding?

201
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,033
The Staff of Wisdom?

202
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,117
[Shifu] Other hand.

203
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,702
A chewed-up peach pit?

204
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,162
Exactly.

205
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:49,542
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

206
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,794
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

207
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,964
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

208
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,633
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

209
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,971
[straining] There we go.

210
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,597
[grunts] All right, universe.

211
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,267
Give me some guidance.

212
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,478
[Po's inner voice] <i>Inner peace.</i>

213
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,730
<i>Inner peace.</i>

214
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:13,774
<i>Inner peace.</i>

215
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,609
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

216
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,653
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

217
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,822
<i>Snow peas?</i>

218
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,074
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

219
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,200
[grunts]

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,493
Inner peace.

221
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,370
Inner peace.

222
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,706
[inhales deeply]

223
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,541
This is not working at all.

224
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,209
Maybe focus on your breathing?

225
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,962
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

226
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,798
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

227
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,551
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

228
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,887
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

229
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,930
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

230
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,515
How many voices do I have in there?

231
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,684
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

232
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,352
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

233
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:53,189
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

234
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,858
- [voices overlapping]
- [screaming]

235
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,276
Anyone want a cookie?

236
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:00,946
[wind whistling]

237
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,742
Universe?

238
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,287
Is that you?

239
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,000
[inhales]

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,084
[chokes]

241
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,378
[coughing]

242
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,140
Attention, mysterious figure!

243
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,436
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

244
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,272
[exclaims]

245
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:38,192
I know you're in here.

246
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,819
Just a matter of time before I find you.

247
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:43,447
Ooh.

248
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,283
[grunts]

249
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,248
[exclaims]

250
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,542
You can't hide from justice forever.

251
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,001
[gasps]

252
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,049
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

253
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,009
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

254
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,345
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

255
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,097
If you insist.

256
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,235
- [exclaims]
- Oh, no!

257
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,530
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

258
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,158
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

259
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,828
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

260
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,746
I am the Dragon Warrior.

261
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,209
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

262
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,961
[grunts, screams]

263
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,388
[distorted] Whoa.

264
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,016
Hi-yah!

265
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,145
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

266
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,688
Who's desecrating what now?

267
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,481
Master Ostrich's Egg!

268
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:02,193
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

269
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,570
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

270
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,821
Whoopsies.

271
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,327
Ha-ha! [grunts] Oh!

00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,082
[chuckles]

274
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,044
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

275
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,588
Which I've already broken! Twice!

276
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,759
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

277
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,720
- [whispering warriors murmuring]
- [exhales]

278
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,598
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

279
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,475
- I've never felt more awake!
- [grunts]

280
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,435
[grunting]

281
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,021
[Po] The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

282
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:41,065
- [hammer clinks]
- [urn cracks]

283
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,608
[whispering warriors gasping]

284
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:43,943
You're gonna pay for that.

285
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:44,860
[gasps]

286
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,572
Hello?

287
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,245
- [Po gasps]
- [fox grunts]

288
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,706
[whispering warriors groaning]

289
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,626
You faker.

290
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,711
It's not faking. It's called Method.

291
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,005
Catch ya later, panda.

292
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,840
No.

293
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,057
I think I'll catch you now.

294
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,353
[grunts]

295
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:20,771
[exclaims]

296
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:21,856
Whoa!

297
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,650
[grunting]

298
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:29,697
Whoa!

299
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,116
Whoa!

300
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:36,704
Told ya.

301
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,832
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

302
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,792
That's Dragon Warrior-- [yelps]

303
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,336
Let go of me.

304
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,671
Just tell me one thing.

305
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,090
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

306
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,384
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

307
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,802
at the Valley of Peace prison.

308
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,763
Valley of Peace prison? [scoffs]
Sounds like a day care.

309
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,515
It is a day care on the weekends.

310
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,726
But it's also a prison.

311
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,935
[villager] There he is!

312
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:00,978
Dragon Warrior!

313
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,980
- [ram foreman] Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

314
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,150
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

315
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,736
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

316
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,614
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

317
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,949
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

318
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,118
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

319
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:20,164
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

320
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,166
Well, you know what they say...

321
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:27,004
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

322
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:51,195
[Po] Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

323
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,619
Very clever, fox. You know something.

324
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,788
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

325
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,165
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

326
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:04,833
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

327
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,043
I mean, what's in it for me?

328
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,128
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

329
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,673
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

330
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,466
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

331
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,759
I don't have time for games.

332
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,928
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

333
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:20,099
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

334
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,350
Wait. She?

335
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,643
Mine!

336
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,689
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

337
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,981
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

338
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,108
<i>The master of deception.</i>

339
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,485
<i>The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.</i>

340
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,695
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

341
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,447
The Chameleon.

342
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,532
[guards gasp]

343
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,702
This is kind of a private conversation.

344
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:40,911
[honking]

345
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,454
Who's The Chameleon?

346
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,832
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

347
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,293
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

348
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,962
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

349
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,131
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

350
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:56,051
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

351
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:57,720
She isn't someone who can be found.

352
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,514
At least not without someone in the know.

353
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,392
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

354
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:06,478
[sighs] Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

355
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,771
I'm in the know.

356
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,316
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

357
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,942
Good luck.

358
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:15,112
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

359
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:16,405
blend in anywhere?

360
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,369
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

361
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,747
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

362
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,040
Deal.

363
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,250
- [Shifu] Po!
- [yelps]

364
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,543
What do you think you're doing?

365
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,005
[stammers] There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

366
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,090
That's a job for the Furious Five.

367
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,135
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

368
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,012
Look, I know that change is difficult

369
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,556
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

370
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,017
but your job is finding a successor.

371
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,479
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

372
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,189
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

373
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm a red panda.

374
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:54,568
You know what? I love that for you.

375
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,195
Po, this is your decision.

376
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,658
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

377
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,414
- Thanks for the free stay.
- [Shifu] What are you doing?

378
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,832
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

379
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,376
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

380
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,460
You can't leave.

381
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,713
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

382
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,925
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

383
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,678
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

384
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,055
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

385
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,391
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!
- [honks]

386
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,518
[groans]

387
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:31,438
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

388
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,107
That's a good back scratcher.

389
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,441
- Yoink!
- Hey!

390
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,694
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

391
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,320
It doesn't work like that.

392
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,115
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

393
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,076
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

394
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,828
No! What do you take me for?

395
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:46,912
An easy mark.

396
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:47,997
What's an easy mark?

397
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,665
Someone who's easy to steal from,

398
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,876
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

399
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,044
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

400
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,759
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

401
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,887
and her favorite food is panda.

402
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,682
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

403
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:10,436
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

404
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:11,979
[bunnies crying]

405
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,900
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

406
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,401
Or you.

407
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,990
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

408
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,784
[bunny] Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

409
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,745
The-- The Chameleon?

410
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,081
[chuckles] Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

411
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,335
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

412
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:38,214
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

413
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:43,177
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

414
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,386
He's always come out on top.

415
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,597
You're right. You're right.

416
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,474
But what if you're wrong?

417
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,226
Calm down, Ping.

418
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,229
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

419
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,650
[bear crime boss] Who is she to summon us?

420
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,901
[crocodile crime boss] Classic power move.

421
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,279
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

422
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,908
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

423
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,618
You left out the evil sorceress part.

424
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,495
We used to run this city.

425
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,081
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

426
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,667
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

427
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,168
Yeah, but what could we do?

428
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,380
Together, we can take her down.

429
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,299
- [all gasp]
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

430
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,303
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

431
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:30,182
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

432
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:32,101
Or you're The Chameleon.

433
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,853
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

434
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,229
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

435
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,523
[as The Chameleon] ...I'm The Chameleon.

436
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:38,732
I said don't say it.

437
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:48,158
We obviously spoke out of turn.

438
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:49,243
Sorry, Chameleon.

439
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,120
No, no. Don't apologize.

440
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,624
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

441
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:59,378
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

442
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,047
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

443
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,551
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

444
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,136
What was the rest?

445
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,054
Reptilian runt.

446
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:13,225
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

447
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,269
You already have the city.

448
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,229
What else could you possibly want?

449
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:21,317
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

450
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:24,111
As close as the blood moon.

451
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,779
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

452
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,407
So little time, so many expenses.

453
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:33,829
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

454
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:34,955
No.

455
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,337
What was that now?

456
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,423
I mean no disrespect.

457
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,718
Don't worry.

458
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:53,682
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

459
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:59,104
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

460
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,982
But I never forget.

461
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,276
You might say I have the memory...

462
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:05,486
Oh, don't say it.

463
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,613
...of an elephant.

464
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,117
[groans]

465
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,793
[trumpets]

466
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:23,379
[all gasp]

467
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,632
You think
I've pushed you too far?

468
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:30,803
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

469
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:34,640
just how far I can push.

470
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:38,018
[grunting, groaning]

471
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,436
[whimpering]

472
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:43,732
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

473
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,697
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

474
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,782
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

475
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:54,660
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

476
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,453
Wanna split my almond cookie?

477
00:23:56,453 --> 00:24:00,040
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

478
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,418
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

479
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,377
The "bam-what-le"?

480
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:05,421
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

481
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,006
Do you want the cookie or not?

482
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,301
- [grunting]
- [crunching]

483
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,469
I got my eye on you.

484
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,974
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

485
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,183
Just a little farther.

486
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,073
[both screaming]

487
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:36,619
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

488
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,289
Well, I-- I-- I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

489
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,042
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

490
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,460
All right, all right.

491
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,296
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

492
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,632
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

493
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,217
I'm kinda freaking out!

494
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,259
So am I.

495
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,555
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

496
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,433
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured? [gasps]

497
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,352
[both] Our baby!

498
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,938
Okay, okay.

499
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,190
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

500
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,152
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

501
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,279
- What's that?
- Us.

502
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,199
Now, let's go find our son.

503
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,408
I hope Po's okay.

504
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,453
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

505
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,498
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

506
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:25,000
- [Li] Who was that idiot?
- [Mr. Ping] Me, of course.

507
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,544
I was the wise goose.

508
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,295
[Li] Oh, yeah.

509
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,214
[Po] Whoa.

510
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,258
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

511
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,051
[fox] That's no village.

512
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,011
That's Juniper City.

513
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:37,846
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

514
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,390
Just a boat ride away.

515
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,976
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

516
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,936
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

517
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,814
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

518
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,526
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

519
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,819
No stealing.

520
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,321
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

521
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,198
Well, that sounds inviting.

522
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:57,783
[screams, grunts]

523
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,122
Anybody lose a rabbit?

524
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:09,336
[grunts, groans]

525
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,629
Stir faster!

526
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,965
[whimpering]

527
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:16,135
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

528
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:18,971
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

529
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,931
And stay out of trouble.

530
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,560
Hey, what you guys playing?

531
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,312
Mah-jongg.

532
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,980
And the stakes are high.

533
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,064
Can I play?

534
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,484
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

535
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,153
[gamblers chuckle]

536
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,363
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

537
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,240
A boat ride to Juniper City.

538
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,325
Ask this guy.

539
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,035
[exhales]

540
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,871
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

541
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,414
- [coin clinks]
- Thanks.

542
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,499
[grunts]

543
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,542
[sighs]

544
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,337
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

545
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:53,214
Never played before, huh?

546
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,216
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

547
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,509
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

548
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,511
I am the manager.

549
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:04,225
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

550
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,601
I don't want any trouble.

551
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,561
[chuckles] Trouble runs from me.

552
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,021
[squawks] Then it'll cost you double.

553
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:11,565
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

554
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,400
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

555
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,070
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

556
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,491
You got a deal.

557
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,452
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

558
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,871
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

559
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:27,331
Yes. Everything, again.

560
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:29,375
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

561
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,960
- Keep stirring!
- [yelps]

562
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,130
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

563
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,174
But how did you pay for this?

564
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,134
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

565
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,594
- I'm proud of you.
- [grunts]

566
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,099
- [gamblers gasp]
- [boar snorts]

[boar grunting, snorting]

569
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:52,690
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

570
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,609
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

571
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,114
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

572
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:03,158
[gulps] There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

573
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,580
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

574
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,708
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

575
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,710
I'm only hungry for...

576
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,169
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

577
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,130
Well, then, come and get it.

578
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,132
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

579
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,175
- Destroy them!
- [tavern patrons growl]

00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:33,898
I got it!

583
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,990
[creaks, thuds]

584
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:45,409
There you go.

585
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:48,829
- All better.
- [screams]

586
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,582
- Come on! Gotcha.
- [broth sizzles, burbles]

587
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:52,833
Keep stirring!

588
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,751
[whimpering]

[creaks]

594
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,988
I'll take that.

595
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,368
Think this belongs to you.

No stealing!

[screams]

600
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:49,098
[groans] Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

601
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:51,392
It's never too late to do the right thing.

602
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,018
- [groans]
- Get them!

603
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,770

[Zhen] Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[tavern patrons screaming]

Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

615
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:40,107
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings. [yelps]

...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

628
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:12,264
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

629
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,768
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

630
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:20,564
[honks] You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

631
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,733
Act brave? Got it.

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,402
- Ah! [screams]
- Oh!

[sighs] Keep working on it.

640
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:49,426
[Zhen sighs] Juniper City.

641
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,345
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

642
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,347
Does your family live there too?

643
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,683
They would. If I had a family.

644
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,853
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

645
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,022
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

646
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,065
Hey!

647
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:06,193
[Zhen] <i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

648
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,821
Stop running! Stop running!

649
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:16,912
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

650
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:18,372
Well, I mean I was.

651
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:22,293
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

652
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:26,005
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

653
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,548
- Right, Mom?
- [squawks]

654
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,426
Then, one day, a local took me in.

655
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:33,888
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

656
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,265
After that, I was never alone again.

657
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:37,474
I guess we both got lucky.

658
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,517
I guess.

659
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,895
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

660
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:41,937
Peace.

661
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:43,439
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

662
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,356
Red panda.

663
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,400
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

664
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,568
[sighs]

665
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,987
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

666
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:53,073
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

667
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,242
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

668
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:58,329
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

669
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,873
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

670
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:03,542
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

671
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,753
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

672
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:07,463
Okay.

673
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,840
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

674
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,799
[squawks]

675
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,886
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

676
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,387
than move on to the one you don't.

677
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:17,181
Hey, that was pretty good.

678
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,098
Yeah.

679
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:21,936
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

680
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:23,854
[gulping]

681
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:25,898
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

682
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,441
Should he be driving?

683
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,594
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

684
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:57,471
Looks a little light.

685
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,348
Go back out and get me more!

686
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,266
More?

687
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,433
But-- But, Chameleon--

688
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:05,062
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

689
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:06,480
[crime bosses murmuring]

690
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,193
At last, my destiny approaches.

691
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:20,410
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

692
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,039
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

693
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,339
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

694
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,675
[Zhen] <i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

695
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:38,888
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

696
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,932
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

697
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,642
A vision?

698
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,185
While you were asleep?

699
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,604
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

700
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,397
Not a dream, a vision.

701
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:50,482
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

702
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:52,318
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

703
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:54,320
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

704
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,280
Well, then you're in luck.

705
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,449
Welcome to Juniper City.

706
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,080
Whoa!

707
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:10,377
[Zhen] This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

708
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,671
do whatever you wanna do,

709
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:15,966
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

710
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,051
Uh, if that's your thing.

711
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:20,679
Land ho!

712
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,931
[Po, Zhen grunt]

713
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,891
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

714
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:28,229
[grunts]

715
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,194
Ah!

716
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,571
- Whoa!
- Move!

717
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,323
- Look out!
- Sorry!

718
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,407
Out of the way!

719
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,202
I've never seen so much traffic before.

720
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,287
[Zhen] You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

721
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:47,581
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

722
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,626
Come on!

723
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,174
Well, sure is good to be home again.

724
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:59,009
The sights. The sounds.

725
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,720
[sniffs] The smells.

726
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:05,933
[panting]

727
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:09,562
It's a wonton wonderland!
[chuckles, whoops]

728
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,731
Yeah!

729
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:16,026
[laughs]

730
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,653
- [panting]
- [Zhen] Po. Po!

731
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,154
Focus!

732
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:21,240
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

733
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,618
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

734

- [pig whimpering]

[growling, chuckling]

738
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,007
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

739
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,133
Oh, yeah.

740
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:42,803
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

741
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:45,848
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

742
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,642
How'd you know?

743
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,644
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

744
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,729
Let's keep moving.

745
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,147
- [citizen] Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

746
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,315
Long time no see.

747
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,232
How you doing, Zhen?

748
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:57,484
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

749
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,738
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

750
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,576
What? You're a wanted criminal?

751
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,163
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

752
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,165
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

753
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,499
Don't worry.

754
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,710
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

755
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,338
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

756
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:18,464
Must be a slow workweek.

757
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,715
I'll handle this.

758
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,885
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

759
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,347
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

760
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,973
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

761
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,433
Dragon Warrior.

762
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,727
Anyone? Nothing?

763
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,729
Perhaps you know me better as...

764
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,857
the Kung Fu Panda!

[chuckling] Can you believe that guy?

767
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:42,947
Aw, come on!

768
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:46,242
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

769
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:52,665
- Wait, what's your way-- [screams, grunts]

Sorry.

Come on, come on, come on, come on!

772
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:00,047
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

773
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,758
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

774
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,052
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

775
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,012

before they call for...

00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,533
Whoa! Whoa!

801
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:12,077
[citizens exclaiming]

802
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,746
I'm falling...

803
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,581
very slowly.

804
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,291
[yelps]

805
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,668
Ow! [screaming]

806
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:24,673
[screaming continues]

807
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,803
[grunting, yelping]

808
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,348
[grunts] Sorry.

809
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,183
[sobs]

810
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,727
[bulls grunting]

811
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:44,443
[all panting, whimpering]

812
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:49,657
Whew.

813
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:58,123
There they are!

814
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,211
We don't have time for a drum solo!

815
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:05,256
We're trapped. [grunts]

816
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,842
[bulls grunt]

817
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:12,179
[Po screams]

818
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,600
[speaking indistinctly]

819
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:18,686
It isn't much farther now.

820
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,355
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

821
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:26,485
Whoa. What is this place?

822
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:27,945
Home sweet home.

823
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:31,532
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

824
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:37,079
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

825
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,792
[Po] Uh-oh.

826
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,044
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

827
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:46,463
[snarling]

828
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,674
[Po screams]

829
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:49,758
Ooh!

830
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:50,926
[bunnies snarling]

831
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,679
[Po exclaiming]

832
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:56,181
Ow!

833
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,480
Oh! [giggling]

834
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,733
So you're friends
with all these people?

835
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,026
They're practically family.

836
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:08,360
Zhen!

837
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:10,404
[pipes rattling]

838
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,701
Oh! Is that really you?

839
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,162
Han, my old mentor.

840
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:21,123
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

841
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:22,583
And when you did...

842
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:27,213
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

843
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,547
Family, huh?

844
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:29,882
More like distant cousins.

845
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:31,800
All right. How should we do this?

846
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,970
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

847
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,390
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

848
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,143
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

849
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:42,686
- Hooray!
- Yay!

850
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,271
You really don't wanna do this.

851
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,356
And why is that?

852
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,608
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

853
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,276
you're gonna have to answer to...

854
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,987
the Dragon Warrior.

855
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,615
[whispering] Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

856
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:56,909
Who?

857
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:58,661
[crowd murmuring]

858
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,623
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

859
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,041
Introduce them, Po,

860
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,127
to your fists.

861
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:08,712
[crowd muttering]

862
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:16,387
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

863
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,389
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

864
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,266
Yes, now.

865
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:23,602
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

866
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,979
We are in total agreement...

867
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,981
...with our mutual disappointment...

868
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,148
[both] ...in you.

869
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:30,985
Wait.

870
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,656
He who resorts to violence now...

871
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:40,202
will only find more violence later.

872
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,161
[crowd] Huh?

873
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:46,709
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

874
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,669
We can hurt her a lot later.

875
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,504
What? No, that's not what I said.

876
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:54,550
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

877
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,927
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

878
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,345
- More violence!
- Hooray!

879
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,931
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

880
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,058
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

881
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:06,687
- I like it.
- [bunnies] Violence, violence, violence.

882
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,897
No, no, no! Wait!

883
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:08,981
Come back!

884
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:10,941
I'll come up with better wisdom.

885
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,903
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

886
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,948
- [Po] Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

887
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,783
[Po] The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

888
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,702
Those are both very common names.

889
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,495
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

890
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,164
Trained by Master Shifu?

891
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,374
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

892
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,835
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

893
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:30,878
But not you.

894
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:34,340
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

895
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,718
Look, Han.

896
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,721
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

897
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,431
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

898
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,266
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

899
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,227
[sizzles]

900
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:49,730
Oh! [giggling]

901
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,858
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

902
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,401
And why should I help you?

903
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,071
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

904
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:58,572
is a good-hearted soul

905
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,491
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

906
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:02,660
Fine.

907
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,205
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

908
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:07,873
Sleep tight.

909
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:10,042
[Han chuckling]

910
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:14,213
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

911
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,798
After you get your pants back.

912
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,384
Not cool! You guys--

913
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,010
Come on! Give them back.

914
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,428
Those are custom.

915
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:23,556
[apes shrieking]

916
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:31,146
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

917
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,358
Oh! Oh, my tail. [grunts]

918
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:37,528
I'm sure everything is fine.

919
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:38,988
This is a restaurant.

920
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:41,991
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

921
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,242
You wait here.

922
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:47,121
Salutations!

923
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,707
I'm so sorry to interrupt. [chuckles]

924
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:51,166
I know you're having a good time,

925
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:55,838
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

926
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,882
There was a panda here.

927
00:44:58,549 --> 00:44:59,633
You know him?

928
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:02,428
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

929
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:04,430
[quacking]

930
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:06,724
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

931
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:10,936
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

932
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,231
[glass shatters]

933
00:45:15,107 --> 00:45:18,235
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

934
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,196
Is it possible your broth was bland?

935
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:21,572
Try it.

936
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:24,325
[exclaims] No, no!

937
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:26,327
The broth smells excellent.

938
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:30,080
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

939
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,624
[Li] Hands off the goose.

940
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,710
[tavern patrons gasping]

941
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:36,629
The panda's back.

942
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,088
- He's back?
- He's back?

943
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,173
No.

944
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,927
But you're about to wish he was,

945
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:45,387
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

946
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:48,349
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

947
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,310
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

948
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:55,523
Except one thing.

949
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,066
Mercy.

950
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,779
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

951
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:06,617
Now, this can go one of two ways.

952
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:10,996
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

953
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:12,081
or the hard way,

954
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,833
in which you tell me where he is,

955
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,794
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

956
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:18,170
because you have no teeth.

957

Where's our son?

974
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,685
He took a boat to Juniper City.

00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:15,853
Which way?

976
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:19,106
You know, a wise goose once--

977
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,399
Time to go.

00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,734

Okay, let's try this again.

Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

989
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,527
Not gonna happen with a broom.

990
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:05,694
Yeah? Still not bad though.

991
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:11,033
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

992
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:12,493
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

993
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,662
- And "ska-blam" is?

like any of the other masters I've met.

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,887
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

No, you're, like, a good guy.

Listen up. The coast is clear.

Thieves, hit the streets.

1002

And you two,

1003
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,690
get out of my sight.

1004
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:55,494
Huh?

1005
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,297
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

1006
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:09,049
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

1007
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:13,387
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

1008

A chewed-up peach pit?

1009
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:18,475
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

1010
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:21,854
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

1011
00:49:21,854 --> 00:49:26,108
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

1012
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,112
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

1013
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,703
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1014
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:40,581
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

1015
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:45,628
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

1016

You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

1017
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,133
Thank you.

1018
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,761
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

Hey, look. Po was here.

1032
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,465
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

1033
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:34,510
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

All right, stand back. Here I go.

1061

Zhen?

1062
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,179
Where are you taking my staff?

1063
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:46,892
I think you mean my staff?

1064
00:52:46,892 --> 00:52:50,729
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

1065
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,941
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

1066
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,568
You were right, Zhen.

1067
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:56,986
He was an easy mark.

1068
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,362
Zhen...

1069
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,532
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

1070
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,534
[chuckles] I taught her that.

1071
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,245
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

1072
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:07,496
Apprentice?

1073
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:09,415
She's the one that took you in?

1074
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:11,834
Best thing that ever happened to her.

1075
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,212
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

<i>Such potential.</i>

1082
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,045
So I took her in.

1083
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,924
I made her what she is today.

1084
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:01,508
Stand up straight.

1085
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:02,676
Yes, master.

1086
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:06,347
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

1087
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:07,431
Why?

1088
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:13,312
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

1089
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:15,356
I wanted respect and power.

1090
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:18,108
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

1091
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,193
Say what?

1092
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:22,780
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

1093
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,867
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

1094
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:30,079
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

1095
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,332
And so, I chose a different path.

1096
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,084
Sorcery.

1097
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:36,335
I grew.

1098
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:38,629
I excelled.

1099
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:42,466
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1100
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,427
- Everything except kung fu.
- [roars]

1101
00:54:45,427 --> 00:54:49,640
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

1102
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:54,895
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

1103
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:57,982
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

1104
00:54:57,982 --> 00:55:00,609
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

1105
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,820
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

1106
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,407
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

1107
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:11,328
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

1108
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:13,372
You forgot about me.

1110
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,168

00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:23,340
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

1112

You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

1113
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:28,846
Then I won't go through them.

1114
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:30,973

- Zhen?

00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:29,323
My staff! Hand it over.

1130
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:32,326
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

1131
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:34,662
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

Po! [pants]

No!

Well done, Zhen.

1139
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:54,431
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

1140
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,642
What's the second rule
of the streets?

1141
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:59,228
Someone always gets hurt.

1142
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:01,313
And make sure it's never you.

1143
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:05,109
I just wish there had been another way.

1144
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:06,819
Third rule of the streets?

1145

Third rule?

1146
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:11,198
Some would say
it's the most important:

1147
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:14,827
No one is interested in your feelings.

1148
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,081
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

And smile.

1150

Nobody likes a grouch.

1151
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:27,840
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

[gasps] Whoa!

1158
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:47,776

It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

1170
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,097
[Po] So you followed me.

1171
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,474
- It was his idea.
- [grunts]

1172
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,434
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

1173
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,603
We only follow because we love.

1174
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:25,564
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

1175
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:27,900
And because we love?

1176
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:31,070
Well, you're right.

1177
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:33,531
I screwed up big-time.

1178
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,242
I trusted the wrong person.

1179
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:38,827
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

1180
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:41,497
Oh...

1181
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:46,835
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

1182
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,171
[sighs]

1183
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:53,217
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

1184
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:56,804
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

1185
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:59,765
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

1186
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,935
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

1187
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:04,562
Even me.

1188
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:07,439
There was a time not so long ago

1189
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:12,361
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

1190
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:13,821
So what happened?

1191
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:16,907
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

1192
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,033
It's true.

1193
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,077
But I also became a father.

1194
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:23,914
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

1195
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,376
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

1196
00:59:27,376 --> 00:59:30,963
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

1197
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,134
Because if things stayed the same forever,

1198
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:38,012
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

1199
00:59:39,638 --> 00:59:40,764
He's right, Po.

1200
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:44,059
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

1201
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,978
- Strong. Brave.

00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:53,652
Get those cages up there. Come on.

1206
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:56,572
Hmm. This looks bad.

1207
00:59:56,572 --> 00:59:57,698
Really bad.

1208
00:59:57,698 --> 00:59:58,782
[Komodo dragon] Move it.

1209
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,701
- [whip cracks]
- [Komodo dragon] Come on.

1210
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:10,169
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

1211
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:12,796
What? No. It's-It's just--

1212
01:00:12,796 --> 01:00:16,550
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

1213
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,803
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

1214
01:00:21,472 --> 01:00:26,185
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

1215
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,603
[chuckles] Zhen.

1216
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:32,066
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

1217
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,150
like me.

1218
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,528
And the day you stop being those things

1219
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:39,907
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

1220
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:43,494
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

1221

[skylight unlocks]

1222
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:55,631
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

1223
01:00:55,631 --> 01:01:01,554
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

[breathes heavily]

1225
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:10,062
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

[both chitter]

1227
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:14,567
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1228
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,570
No?

1229
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,654
Just me?

1230
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:20,823
Hmm.

1231
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,118
Ugh.

1232
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,287
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1233
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,248
[scoffs] I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1234
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:42,887

Big fan.

1238
01:01:56,233 --> 01:01:59,111
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

1239
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:02,239
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

The puffy panda?

1241

[chuckles] Po might be an idiot,

1242
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:09,163
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1243
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,540
Who said anything about willingly?

Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

1246
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:27,306
Now, why have you brought me back?

1247
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:29,475
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1248
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:31,560
your most legendary kung fu moves.

1249
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,688
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1250

And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

Please be reasonable.

I'm not going anywhere

01:04:58,207 --> 01:05:00,292
I was wrong about everything.

1287
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:04,004
- [straining]
- What are you doing?

1288
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,631
Stopping you.

1289
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:07,508
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1290
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,759
No.

1291
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:10,469
Move.

1292
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:12,221
You want me to move?

1293
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,514
Move me.

1294
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:16,100
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

1295
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,686
- [Zhen grunts]
- Why are you doing this?

1296
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:21,689

if I get killed or not?

1306
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,361
Please, Po.

1307
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,572
Just let me do one thing right.

1308
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:19,580
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

1309
01:06:21,582 --> 01:06:23,709
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

1310
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:24,835
'Fraid so.

1311
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:27,755
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

1312
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:28,923
I'm afraid not.

1313
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:30,925
You can't beat her, you know.

1314
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:32,509
You're probably right.

1315
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,387
But I have to try.

1316
01:06:37,014 --> 01:06:38,974
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

1317
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,059
Po!

1318
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:42,269
[Mr. Ping] We should never have
let him come here.

1319
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,522
We are such terrible fathers.

1320
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:46,440
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1321
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,859
Well, that's true.
You're worse.

1322
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:50,778
I am a terrible friend.

1323
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:53,489
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

1324
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,699
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

1325
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,368
We can't let him go in there alone.

1326
01:06:57,368 --> 01:06:58,953
What can we do?

1327
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:01,413
There are just three of us
against an army.

1328
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:04,208
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

- You know, Po.

1339
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:36,866
The panda.

1340

No, no. A different panda.

- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,125
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1343
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:49,795
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1344
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,755
So, I need yours.

1345
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:53,591
Why should we help you?

1346
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:54,925
Because--

1347
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:56,010
Because...

1348
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,429
it's the right thing to do.

Stop laughing.

1352
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,690
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1353
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,445
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1354
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:19,532
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

1355
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:23,077
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1356
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,121
the more wrong we can do later.

the fundamental point.

Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1365
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:48,979
was underestimating his opponent.

1366

I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

- [Po] Hey.
- [gasps, grunts]

1368

[annoyed Komodo] Shut up, Larry.

1370

I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

We will? [chuckles]

I-I mean, we will.

But how?

1376
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:18,550
Just leave that to me.

and draining us of all our moves.

1389

[Tai Lung] Panda.

1398

Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1399
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:32,208
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

Whoa. Tai Lung?

1401
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:38,297
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

Now, this can go one of two ways.

The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

a villain told me
how much we had in common.

1444
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:54,058
It's true.

1445
01:12:54,058 --> 01:12:56,393
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1446
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:59,522
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

1447
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:02,149
It is a shame, for you.

1448
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:07,112
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1449
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:11,575
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

1450
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:13,369
Every other city and town and village

1451
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,120
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

1452
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,330
Yeah, I know.

1453
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,415
But how did you know?

1454
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:22,378
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

1455
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:25,881
for now at least.

1456
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:29,468
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

1457
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:31,971
And so should you.

1458
01:13:31,971 --> 01:13:34,848
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

Only on the outside.

1460
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,436
Real change happens from within.

1461
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,897
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1462
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:43,941
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

1463
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:46,360
and become something better
than we already are.

He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

1614
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:33,113
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:37,701
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

Yeah. I'm getting the hang of

Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.
