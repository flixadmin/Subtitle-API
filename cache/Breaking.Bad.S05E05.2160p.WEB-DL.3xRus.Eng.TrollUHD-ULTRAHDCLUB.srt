1
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:52,296
{\an8}Hey, man, look at the sad sack
I found moping around the lobby.

2
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,716
{\an8}- Hey.
- Hey, there, Walt.

3
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,300
{\an8}- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

4
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,845
{\an8}Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you
out of the blue.

5
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,972
{\an8}- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could...

6
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,517
{\an8}No. I'm just kind of settling into the new
digs here. What do you think?

7
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,311
{\an8}It is very nice.

8
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,356
{\an8}- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

9
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,192
{\an8}- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

10
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,361
{\an8}My days of chasing dirt-balls is over.

11
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,613
{\an8}But I'll tell you what, being a boss

12
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,073
{\an8}own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

13
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,787
{\an8}Steve, would you mind if...? I've gotta
run something by Hank, if it's all right.

14
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,040
{\an8}Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

15
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,126
{\an8}- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Thanks again, Steve.

16
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
{\an8}- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

17
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,840
Hey. Look at that.

18
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,758
Jesus, Walt.

19
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,676
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

20
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,512
{\an8}Wow, that's beautiful.

21
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,598
{\an8}- Was it a birthday present?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,142
{\an8}Well, I mean, not really.

23
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,061
{\an8}I bought it for myself.

24
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,732
{\an8}- Hey, well, have a seat.
- Thanks.

25
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,486
{\an8}New car, new watch.

26
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,071
{\an8}Good for you.

27
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,073
{\an8}With all the curveballs
that were thrown at you this year

28
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,326
you deserve to treat yourself.

29
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,871
{\an8}I mean, as long as you got
the money to spend, that is.

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,999
{\an8}So how's Sky?

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,586
{\an8}Actually, she went to work this morning.

32
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,379
{\an8}She wanted to.

33
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:19,676
{\an8}She said she needed to, you know,
keep her mind occupied, and...

34
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,636
{\an8}- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,348
{\an8}I mean, as long as you're all right
with her being on her own and stuff.

36
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,686
{\an8}Yeah, well, you know,
I'm right there with her most of the time.

37
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,440
{\an8}And Mariano kind of keeps an eye
on her when I'm not, so...

38
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,608
{\an8}- Good.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,694
{\an8}And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

40
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:42,324
{\an8}You know, Marie goes off about Dave
like he's a rock star shrink, you know?

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,840
{\an8}They come in like zombies, out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

42
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,164
{\an8}That's great.
Actually, she already found someone.

43
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,207
{\an8}Yeah. Peter...

44
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,611
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank
on his last name. Peter...

45
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,675
{\an8}Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho.
He's supposed to be top-notch.

46
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,559
{\an8}Good, good. I'm glad you're on it.
That's not something you wanna let fester.

47
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,432
{\an8}No. No, you don't. You don't.

48
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,270
{\an8}Hank, I just...

49
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,107
{\an8}I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

50
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,276
{\an8}No, it's... It really is...

51
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,736
{\an8}No, it's nice of you.

52
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,030
And I'd like to come by tonight
and see them, if that's all right.

53
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,783
{\an8}Of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

54
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,828
{\an8}It's great having them.
They're great kids.

55
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,372
{\an8}I appreciate that.

56
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,290
{\an8}I do.

57
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,757
Something else on your mind there, Walt?

58
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,218
Walt, feel free to, you know...

59
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,104
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

60
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,443
And I don't know what to do, Hank.
I don't.

61
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
She...

62
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,536
She says that I'm a bad influence
on the kids,

63
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,331
and that I'm not...

64
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,794
- Not good for them.
- Jeez, Walt.

65
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,754
No.

66
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,883
She thinks I'm a bad father.

67
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,136
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,098
Hey, I mean, Sky and you got your issues,

69
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,977
but that there, that's... That's...

70
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,729
I mean, I'm no...

71
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm not an expert on parenting
or anything, but from where I'm sitting

72
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,526
I just don't see it, you know?

73
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,320
I mean, I...

74
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,865
I think you're great with the kids.
I think you're great with the kids.

75
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,204
You're a provider, a role model,
you know?

76
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,505
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer

77
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,544
that alone,
that's an inspiration to me, you know?

78
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,132
- No, I've made mistakes, you know?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

79
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,926
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

80
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,512
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

81
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,308
I'm gonna give you a moment
to just get it together there.

82
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,894
You want cream and sugar?

83
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,896
Yeah, yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,773
No, no, no.

85
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,567
That... Cup of coffee, right? All right.

86
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,195
Just take a moment. Take a moment.

87
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,335
You know, you two
are really great together.

88
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,465
Take it from me, buddy,
it's always darkest just before the dawn.

89
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,759
Yeah.

90
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,892
What is this place? What is this place?
What are we doing here?

91
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,852
- Get me the table.
- I can't be here.

92
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,231
My daughter, my little girl,
she's gonna be home soon.

93
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,648
What? What are you doing?

94
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,695
- Mike, Mike, Mike...
- Shut up.

95
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,788
Give me her phone.

96
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,460
All right, Lydia.

97
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,213
My friends here don't know you like I do,

98
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,134
so they are very kindly
giving you one last chance.

99
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,474
There's your script. Study it.

100
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,979
In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial
Agent Schrader on your line here,

101
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,523
and you're gonna pass along
this information,

102
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,192
and then we'll see what we see.
Here are the rules:

103
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,654
If you yell for help, try to give the man
some kind of coded message,

104
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,074
or otherwise tip him off,
I am gonna pull out my pistol,

105
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,327
and shoot you in the head.

106
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,246
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

107
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,290
Remember how you like to do that?

108
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,920
If it happens this time,
I am going to pull my pistol out,

109
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,340
and I am going to shoot you in the head.

110
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,966
Look at me, not at them.

111
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,763
Lydia, look at me.

112
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,642
If you make Schrader suspicious
in any way

113
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,395
any way at all,
tell me what's gonna happen next.

114
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,190
- You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.
- And where will I shoot you?

115
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,568
- In the head.
- In the head. That's right.

116
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,196
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

117
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,698
I'm expecting precision here.

118
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,243
We up and running?

119
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,286
Yeah. Computer's set.

120
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,621
Okay, Lydia.

121
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,042
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime

122
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,044
it's now.

123
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,838
You're up.

124
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,176
<i>ASAC's office.</i>

125
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,137
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

126
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,930
<i>I'm sorry. What's this regarding?</i>

127
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,435
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

128
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,771
Hold, please.

129
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,900
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle on line one.

130
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,320
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

131
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,242
Well, this is kind of an odd...

132
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,830
It's just that I was in our warehouse,
supervising a shipment of chemicals

133
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,293
when I noticed a device on the bottom
of one of our barrels of methylamine.

134
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,713
- A device?
- Yeah. I guess you'd call it that. I mean

135
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,176
I'm certainly no expert,
but it looks to me like some kind of a...

136
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,430
A tracking device or a GPS.

137
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,059
So I was just wondering
if maybe your people put it there.

138
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,979
Not that it's any of my business, but
the last thing I wanna do is interfere

139
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,608
with a law enforcement operation
or a sting,

140
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,902
or whatever you call it.

141
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,447
So I don't know

142
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,991
maybe you could give me some guidance?

143
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,285
Well, I'll tell you what.

144
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,578
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would,

145
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,914
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

146
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,460
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

147
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,795
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.

148
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,130
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. Quayle.</i>

149
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,840
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

150
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,641
Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?

151
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,769
- Yeah?
- Hey, man.

152
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,647
<i>You know anything about GPS trackers
on a methylamine barrel?</i>

153
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:13,607
<i>Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.</i>

154
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,235
<i>Nope. Nobody from my team
planted anything. Why?</i>

155
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,614
<i>Oh, I don't know. I figured as much.</i>

156
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,574
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

157
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,411
I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

158
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,623
- I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
- Shut up.

159
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,209
And there you have it, like I said.

160
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,378
All right. So now what?

161
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,244
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's
probably thinking some crew planted it

162
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,550
looking for a weak spot to pull a heist.

163
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,261
He's gonna send a team over
to that warehouse.

164
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,805
He's gonna wire it out the wazoo.
Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.

165
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,683
So the warehouse is too hot.

166
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,269
Her supply is useless to us now.

167
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,731
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

168
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:56,025
We're 900 miles closer, after all.

169
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,362
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

170
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,072
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there

171
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,077
use her security code to gain access
and we take every barrel we can.

172
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,831
U-Haul can only take six or seven
before the suspension gives out.

173
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,042
It's a stopgap. But right now,
it's the best we can do.

174
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,672
Well, what about her?

175
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,844
You two drive the barrels back tonight.

176
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,721
I'll deal with her.

177
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,516
No. No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

178
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,352
This was not me.
I swear to God I didn't do it.

179
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,229
I don't know.
Sounds like she's telling the truth to me.

180
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,275
She has a gun to her head, kid.

181
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,235
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep
with a gun to their head.

182
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,196
I'm sorry, Jesse.

183
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,575
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

184
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,785
It's two against one.

185
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,622
No. No! You can't kill me! Come on!

186
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,250
I swear I didn't do anything!

187
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,378
<i>Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?</i>

188
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>You got it.</i>

189
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,428
<i>Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.</i>

190
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,806
<i>He's on the line.</i>

191
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:12,727
<i>Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys
didn't do something as lamebrained</i>

192
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>as put a GPS tracker on the outside
of a barrel of methylamine.</i>

193
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>One earmarked for the
Madrigal warehouse in Houston?</i>

194
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,154
<i>Who's asking?
Did someone find them?</i>

195
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,739
<i>Jesus. Are you shitting me?</i>

196
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,866
<i>Since when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outside of a barrel?</i>

197
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,452
<i>We didn't have time
to go in with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,736
<i>They were about to ship.</i>

199
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom.
They were well-hidden.</i>

200
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,792
<i>Oh, really?
Well, not well-hidden enough.</i>

201
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294
<i>How many barrels you tag?</i>

202
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,339
<i>All of them. All the ones headed
to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

203
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:46,302
<i>Christ. All right. Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.</i>

204
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,969
<i>Next time, a little communication first,
all right?</i>

205
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,016
<i>- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.</i>
- Asshole.

206
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,731
Aside... Aside from the fact

207
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,611
that we almost killed this woman,
all of those barrels are already marked.

208
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,363
We solve the problem we can.

209
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,407
This has not changed the equation
one iota for her.

210
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,578
Oh, come on! You are not seriously
still considering killing me?

211
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,957
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now.

212
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,544
I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.

213
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,672
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

214
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,841
She is saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

215
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,680
I am telling you, she will turn a gun or
a badge on us the first chance she gets.

216
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:35,393
The woman put a hit out on me.

217
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,229
Seriously?

218
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,359
Wait. A hit? What? Like the mafia?

219
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,237
Yeah, like the mafia.

220
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,865
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

221
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,366
You wanna talk methylamine?

222
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,079
Then tell your partner to stop
threatening me, and let's talk.

223
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,540
Talk about what? You heard.

224
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,834
You can't even get us a single barrel.

225
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,003
Who said anything about barrels?

226
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,132
I'm talking about an ocean of the stuff.

227
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,767
{\an8}Just give him a minute, would you?

228
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,769
{\an8}Trust him.

229
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,104
{\an8}"Trust him."

230
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,153
Okay. So let's hear it.

231
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,740
Not without a guarantee that once
I tell you how to get what you want

232
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,200
I won't be killed anyway.

233
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,910
Fine. You have my word.

234
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,037
- Not good enough.
- Look, lady...

235
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,041
- Do you have children?
- That has nothing to do with this.

236
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,545
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

237
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,840
Yes, I have children. So what?

238
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,467
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

239
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,969
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

240
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,721
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

241
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,390
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

242
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,351
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

243
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,980
Look, you're a smart businesswoman.

244
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,065
You understand the concept of leverage.

245
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,194
- Please don't patronise me. I hate that.
- You have none.

246
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:17,161
But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.

247
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,205
Is it true that you put a hit out on Mike?

248
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,628
- Yes.
- Why?

249
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,004
I was scared.

250
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,300
- Of Mike?
- Not at first.

251
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,386
There are men who used to work
with Gus Fring in custody now.

252
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,306
Nine of them. They know everything
about me. Everything.

253
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,850
Some of them even know about you,
assuming you're the master chemist

254
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,145
they're always talking about.

255
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,316
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about

256
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,733
- why put the hit on Mike?
- I had no choice.

257
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,029
I'm not going to prison and have my
daughter raised in a group home.

258
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,866
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

259
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,785
I gave him a list of names,

260
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,412
but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

261
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,415
So I hired someone else.
At that point, there was no option,

262
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,209
but to add Mike to the list.

263
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,883
This ocean of methylamine

264
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,178
that you claim you can get your hands on

265
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,516
how much are we talking about, literally?

266
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,894
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

267
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,780
Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight
train leaves the Port of Long Beach

268
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,820
loaded with industrial chemicals.

269
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,947
There's always at least one tanker car
full of methylamine

270
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,581
which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

271
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,078
The train travels east through Arizona

272
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,445
stops at a rail yard outside Flagstaff

273
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,292
where it gets broken down and rebuilt.
But the methylamine always moves on

274
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,295
destined for our pesticide concerns
in Texas and Oklahoma.

275
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,215
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

276
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:58,387
There's a remote three-mile stretch
here in McKinley County.

277
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,472
That's where you do it.

278
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,226
That's where we do what exactly?

279
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,644
Get your methylamine.

280
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,690
- Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?
- You want the stuff?

281
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,108
I'm offering you enough
to fill a swimming pool.

282
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,571
You are offering us a quick trip
to prison. That's what I'm hearing.

283
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,948
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

284
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,369
You have any idea how many alarms
that'll set off between here and D.C.?

285
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,290
None, if you do it right here. If a
freight train is stopped in transit

286
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,917
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots

287
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,755
absolutely, a signal will alarm the FRA
and the TSA Surface Division

288
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,174
at the Department of Homeland
Security. But what you don't know,

289
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,053
and I do, because my job requires me
to keep track of my buyers' shipments

290
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,431
this is dark territory.

291
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,225
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

292
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,977
It's a dead zone.

293
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,482
No automated supervision system,
no alarms, no contact with control.

294
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,858
What about cell phones?

295
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,694
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

296
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,697
I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.

297
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,949
You'd have time enough to stop the train

298
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,535
siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry

299
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,080
- get away before the police are called.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

300
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,792
Assuming we can stop a moving train

301
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,504
how do we know we have the right one?
And which tanker car is which?

302
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,381
I can't believe that they would
advertise their contents.

303
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,675
Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff

304
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,678
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

305
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,681
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2 a.m.

306
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,518
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

307
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,855
Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

308
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,273
I expect to be paid.

309
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,570
We can talk percentages later.

310
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,864
You know what this means, don't you?

311
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,491
We've gotta off the crew.

312
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,451
How do you figure?

313
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,995
If we don't, the engineer's
gonna call the cops

314
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,457
as soon as he gets out of the
dead zone. It's only three miles long.

315
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,793
- We're out in the boonies.
- I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.

316
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,421
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security

317
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,405
are gonna swoop down with choppers
on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.

318
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,970
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

319
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,013
- How many in the crew?
- Just two.

320
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,433
- An engineer and a conductor.
- Assuming there are no security guards.

321
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,317
No guards. It's not like
we're carrying nuclear warheads.

322
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,438
Wait. Two guys.

323
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,607
Can't we just tie them up or something?

324
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:21,029
And then what? Even if we wear a mask,
we're leaving two witnesses behind.

325
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,408
Bottom line, I have done this
long enough to know

326
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,411
that there are two kinds of heists:

327
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,372
Those where the guys get away with it,

328
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,083
and those that leave witnesses.

329
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,879
Give me a break.
You guys were gonna murder me.

330
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,464
I thought you were professionals.

331
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,387
Can you say "ASAC"?

332
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,639
"ASAC." Can you say that?

333
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,142
Say, "ASAC Schrader."

334
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,354
If those turn out to be her first words,
I will beat you with my shoe.

335
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,442
- Don't listen to him, Holly.
- I'm just telling it like it is, babe.

336
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,944
Boss man. I'm the boss man.

337
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,196
Say, "Boss man."

338
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,782
Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.

339
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,494
Hey, that better be something from
a boob instead of some fake soy crap.

340
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,039
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl...

341
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,605
- Your little girl.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

342
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,919
- No. See?
- Okay.

343
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,838
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

344
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,174
She wants me.

345
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,220
Yeah, my little girl,
because I'm not giving her back.

346
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,722
Yeah, I know.

347
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,891
What about Emo McGee?

348
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,809
Has he come out of his room today?

349
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,311
Barely.

350
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,229
When he does, he barely talks.

351
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,523
Yeah, well, what do you expect, you know?

352
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,818
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

353
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,788
Flynn, do you want me to heat up
some of that lasagne

354
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,665
to hold you over till dinner?

355
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,124
No.

356
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,795
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat </i>on Blu-ray.
Wanna watch it with me later?

357
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,925
No. And you can keep
talking about me now.

358
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,848
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

359
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,767
We do it the old-fashioned way.

360
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,354
We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace,
all the halfway houses

361
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,171
scrounge up about a dozen skells,
put them to work smurfing cold pills.

362
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,216
You mean switch back to a pseudo cook.

363
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:27,072
You're the chemist. Admittedly,
it's gonna cut down on our output.

364
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,658
Like a factor of four or five.

365
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,995
It also means that we will eat $80,000

366
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,539
we just invested in our new lab equipment

367
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,125
which is only good for a P2P cook.

368
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,669
You know, I don't have to do
the math to know

369
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,087
that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

370
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,551
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

371
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,013
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

372
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,307
Why is making nothing not an option?

373
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,124
- Walter...
- Let me tell you why.

374
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,478
It's because of your nine guys
in lockup, right?

375
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:02,232
You broke it, you pay for it. And we've
talked about this plenty already.

376
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,859
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more

377
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,655
because what it sounds like you're
telling me, Mike, is that from now on

378
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,574
we have no choice
but to do this piddling pseudo cook,

379
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,702
so that we can pay back your guys.

380
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,246
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

381
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,375
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter

382
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,961
is that you wanna do this heist

383
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,089
even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

384
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,008
That what you want?

385
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,429
You know, I don't know why you insist
on putting words in my mouth here.

386
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:37,642
What if we can rip off that train,
and no one ever knows it got robbed?

387
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,203
Maybe.

388
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,419
Just maybe.

389
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,307
It'll come from that direction.

390
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,086
Seven seventy-five.

391
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,258
Eight hundred.

392
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,473
Eight fourteen.

393
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,646
Wait a minute.

394
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,739
It's perfect. Yeah, we do it here.

395
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,784
We do it right here.

396
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,881
How are we looking, Mike?

397
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,014
All clear.

398
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,849
<i>Copy that.</i>

399
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:49,484
Go down, go down.

400
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,988
You got it. That's good, Fernando.

401
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,463
Hey.

402
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,551
- This one.
- Right.

403
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,765
- You good?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,521
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

405
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,233
Todd, on the day, are you gonna be able
to make this climb?

406
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,819
Yes, sir. I'll be ready.

407
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,155
All right.

408
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,241
- You mind if I ask you a question?
- No. Go ahead.

409
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,952
Well, I get why we want the tank
for the methylamine.

410
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,886
But why this other one for the water?

411
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,248
Well...

412
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,667
Jesse, it's your idea.

413
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,669
You wanna fill him in?

414
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,921
It's all about the weight, yo.

415
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:56,009
The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed
when it gets loaded in Long Beach,

416
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,304
and then again
when it's unloaded in Texas.

417
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,222
If the weights don't match

418
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,724
the train company's
gonna know it got robbed.

419
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:04,851
Okay.

420
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,021
Boosting methylamine from a train
is, like, a major rap.

421
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:14,402
The point is, no one other than us can
ever know that this robbery went down.

422
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,530
Nobody. You got it?

423
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,785
Yeah. Absolutely.

424
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,161
Are you sure?

425
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,039
Yes, sir.

426
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:30,126
With all that said,
the whole thing relies on us

427
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:34,005
replacing the weight of methylamine
we steal with the same weight in water.

428
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,173
So they'll never know
we hit them. Cool.

429
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:40,345
Aqueous methylamine is water-based,
yet it weighs slightly less than water.

430
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:45,892
We will be removing a thousand gallons
of methylamine from the tanker car,

431
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,480
but replacing it with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water

432
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:54,484
which comes to 900.24 gallons.

433
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,987
Actually, Jesse,
let's make that an even 920

434
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:01,198
to account for spillage
and whatever will remain in the hose.

435
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,827
- Yeah.
- How we doing, by the way?

436
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,372
- Eight fifty. We're almost there.
- All right.

437
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,042
Won't they figure they got robbed,
getting watered-down methylamine?

438
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,420
Well, out of 24,000 gallons

439
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:18,341
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

440
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,428
But, yes, you're right. They will notice.

441
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,223
At which point, they will blame China,

442
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,018
for sending a marginally weaker batch.

443
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,814
Damn, you guys thought of everything.

444
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,615
Flynn.

445
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,702
Flynn, open the door.

446
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,788
Just come out and talk to me.

447
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:52,500
I'm staying. That's all I have to say.

448
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,301
- What's going on?
- You got what you wanted, that's what.

449
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,053
Congratulations.

450
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,484
It's me. Open up.

451
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,615
Come on, Junior.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

452
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,159
What?

453
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,369
You know what.

454
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,206
Are you seriously kicking me out
of my own house?

455
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,957
Are you seriously doing that?

456
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,418
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

457
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:39,547
We love you. And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

458
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,614
But your mom and I need some time
alone, and you know that.

459
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:45,553
- We explained that to you.
- You haven't explained jack shit.

460
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:48,556
You want me out? Explain to me why.

461
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,523
Why do I have to go to Uncle Hank's?

462
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,645
Give me the exact reason
or I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,190
This is not gonna be a debate.

464
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,900
What's going on?

465
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,069
Why can't anybody tell me anything?

466
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,988
I want one good reason.

467
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,576
Because we're your parents
and you're our child.

468
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,538
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

469
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,583
Now.

470
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,454
It'll pass. He'll understand.

471
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,008
Don't start, Walt.

472
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,761
I won't change my mind about you.

473
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,848
Ever.

474
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,057
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

475
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,186
I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.

476
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:40,066
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned

477
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,693
I'll make you a deal.

478
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,530
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets,

479
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,366
but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's

480
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,286
where they have a chance of being safe.

481
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,082
I think you've seen too many movies.

482
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,587
Our children are not in danger.

483
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,964
Just a couple of days ago

484
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,581
you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

485
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,928
You said it like it was a point of pride.

486
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,514
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me

487
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,725
there won't come a day
that somebody will knock on that door

488
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,145
looking to harm you or me or all of us.

489
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:21,524
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

490
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,612
You agree to that,

491
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:31,034
and I will be whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

492
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,757
Okay.

493
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,765
By the way

494
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,977
you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho. Peter.

495
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,147
Last name is up to you.

496
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,275
Out burying bodies?

497
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,990
Robbing a train.

498
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,230
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- It's me.

499
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,649
I've got it.

500
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,487
Okay, Mr. White, everything's set.

501
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,943
Hey, Wallace! Up ahead!

502
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,947
Stop the train now!

503
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,594
Stop!

504
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,970
Stop the train!

505
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,990
Now. Go, go, go.

506
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,480
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

507
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,857
It'd be like pancake city out here.

508
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,151
Man.

509
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,153
Hey, you believe this?

510
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,437
I mean, shit fire and save the matches.

511
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,741
Talk about bum luck.

512
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,328
Hey, man, I'm sorry
to put you guys out like this.

513
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,887
What's the trouble with it?

514
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,998
No clue.
I was just driving down the road.

515
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,917
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

516
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,046
Either one of you guys know about
engines? Oh, of course you do.

517
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,007
That's why they call you
an engineer, right?

518
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,804
- All right.
- Think it's...

519
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,681
Think it's in there or something.

520
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:46,890
- You think?
- Yeah.

521
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,184
Probably a pretty good bet.

522
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,480
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

523
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,314
I don't know, man. I just drive it.

524
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,319
- Now. Go, go, go.
- We're on.

525
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,442
- Good?
- Yeah.

526
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:21,777
Go!

527
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,510
It looks good up here.

528
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,303
Now, hold up. There it is.

529
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,764
I think this is the one.

530
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,975
- We good?
- Yeah.

531
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,686
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

532
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,813
All right, let me give it a try.

533
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,785
- Ready?
- Ready.

534
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,497
- Nothing?
- Try again.

535
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,503
- Nothing.
- All right.

536
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,005
Maybe if we all pushed?

537
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,008
All right. It's worth a try.

538
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,221
Any other ideas, you just shout them out.

539
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,473
Not at the moment, I don't.

540
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,269
You coming?

541
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,355
So far, so good.

542
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,358
Give me a status.

543
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:48,613
We're at 300 gallons and counting.

544
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,410
Water is going...

545
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,998
Now.

546
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,085
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

547
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,430
- Good?
- Yeah.

548
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,349
All right.

549
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,820
One, two, three.

550
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,914
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

551
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,831
Yeah, man. Give me a little credit.

552
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,488
You sure you're not out of gas?

553
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,074
I got a full tank here.

554
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,082
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

555
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,496
Why don't we just keep going over it?

556
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,458
There's gotta be something
loose somewhere.

557
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,425
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell of a place
to break down.

558
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,429
I know, right? Crazy.
Hey, you know anything about engines?

559
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,932
Not a whole lot. I can push you off
the tracks at least.

560
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,309
Gee, I wouldn't want you
to mess up your ride.

561
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,979
- I'll go slow. Won't get a scratch.
- You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.

562
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,483
Hey. We're running late because of you.
The man said it was no problem.

563
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,777
Come on already.
And thank you, by the way.

564
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,655
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

565
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,224
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a Good Samaritan on the scene.

566
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,852
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

567
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,479
We're not done yet.

568
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,749
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get out of there.

569
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,860
- Thank you, mister. Much obliged.
- Glad we could work that out for you.

570
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,434
- Yeah, no problem.
- You want a ride into town?

571
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,978
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

572
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,321
Walter, they are back in the locomotive.

573
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,991
<i>If you do not abort right now,
you are gonna get us all busted.</i>

574
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,671
- Ready?
- Yeah.

575
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,134
Mr. White!

576
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,267
Hey!

577
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,228
Hold it! Hold it steady!

578
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,692
Now!

579
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,030
Close it off! Close it off!

580
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:44,951
Todd! Get off! Get off!

581
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,862
Yeah, bitch!

582
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,907
- We did it.
- Oh, yeah!

583
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,950
Oh, my...

584
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,497
- Okay, okay. Nice job.
- Yeah!

585
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,993
No! No! No!

586
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,956
No.
