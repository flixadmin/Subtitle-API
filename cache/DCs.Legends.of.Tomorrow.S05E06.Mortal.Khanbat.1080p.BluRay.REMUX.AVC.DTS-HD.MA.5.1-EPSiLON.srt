00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:04,131
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:06,508
Astra's dead mother
was a powerful witch.

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:08,194
Why did you bring me back?

4
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,970
Natalie, is that really you?

5
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,514
Natalie brought you here
to help me save Astra.

6
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,558
What do you know about the Loom of Fate?

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,869
Do you wanna know what I'm hiding from?

8
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,603
- Yes, I do.
- That bloody Loom.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,438
He still has ten years.

10
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,689
Can you make it zero?

11
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,274
Bye-bye, Johnny.

12
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,988
<i>John.</i>

13
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,239
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

14
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:31,033
<i>What happened?</i>

15
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,326
He just collapsed.

16
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,327
Out of nowhere.

17
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,554
After coughing up
a bucket of blood.

18
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:36,330
Come on, Johnny. Stay with us.

19
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:40,626
Gideon, we'll need to run a scan.

20
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:41,989
Right away, Dr. Palmer.

21
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,421
Oxygen mask, please.

22
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,259
The Loom. Where is it, Charlie?

23
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:50,904
Not now, John, all right?
You've got to rest.

24
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,679
- What loom?
- Astra's ghost mom.

25
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:55,182
She told... Oh, my God.
Hold me, hold me.

26
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,367
- Hold me.
- What the hell's going on?

27
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,077
As you can see from
his chest X-ray,

28
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,979
Mr. Constantine has
a very aggressive form of lung cancer.

29
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,689
I'm afraid it's terminal.

30
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,196
Well, there's no point in quitting now.

31
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,005
There's nothing funny
about lung cancer, John.

32
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,756
Who's laughing?

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,594
If you lose your hair,
I'm shaving my head in solidarity.

34
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:32,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute.

35
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,890
No saucy AI is butchering me
and pumping me full of drugs...

36
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,351
I took the liberty
of administering a sedative.

37
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,272
Mr. Constantine needs to rest.

38
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,984
Gideon, prepare the Jumpship.

39
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,402
<i>Clotho...</i>

40
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:52,072
<i>Where are you going?</i>

41
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:54,616
<i>You can't escape us.</i>

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,410
<i>Clotho...</i>

43
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,245
<i>You can't get away.</i>

44
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,997
<i>We see you.</i>

45
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,208
No, no.

46
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,129
- Oh, mate!
- Charlie.

47
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,254
You're back.

48
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,549
How are you doing, B-easy?

49
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:13,885
Where you been?

50
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,097
I was just...
I was just hanging out at Constantine's.

51
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,808
How is he?

52
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,019
- Dying.
- What?

53
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,645
No, don't worry. You know John-o,

54
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,249
he's always got a trick up his sleeve.

55
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,568
Bro, that donut you made me eat
had me hallucinating.

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,362
Starting today, I'm on a juice cleanse.

57
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,698
Zari, this is my...

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,284
friend, Charlie.

59
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,328
Charlie, meet my sister.

60
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,620
Mmm. Good fashion.

61
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,307
<i>Team meeting
on the bridge.</i>

62
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,415
Does that mean me?

63
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,083
<i>That means you, too, Zari.</i>

64
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
Cool.

65
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,130
So, you coming?

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,050
I wouldn't miss it.

67
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:58,346
Ah, Charlie.

68
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,223
We could really use your help right now.

69
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,352
With Sara in Star City and
Rory in a mood, we are short-staffed.

70
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,603
What's Mick in a mood about?

71
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,189
Ali. His girlfriend.

72
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:09,316
Ray, they only...
they only had sex once.

73
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,401
Well, when you know, you know. You know?

74
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,278
Okay.

75
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,365
Listen, I know
we're all worried about John. Okay?

76
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,658
And we could just sit back
and wait for a miracle.

77
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,661
But does Marie Kondo rest
just because she built an empire?

78
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:22,661
- No.
- No.

79
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,955
No, she tidies up.

80
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,124
And that is exactly
what we're gonna continue to do.

81
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,543
We are gonna tidy up the timeline, yeah?

82
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,004
Gideon, show them
what we've been working on.

83
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,424
Each point represents
a potential Encore,

84
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,386
which means we can catch them
before they change history.

85
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,596
I call her...

86
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,849
The Prognosticator.

87
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,564
Okay.

88
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:54,861
Uh, anyway, there's a Category 5
in 1997, Hong Kong.

89
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,931
A mysterious gangster is moving in
on the Triad's territory.

90
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,451
Ray, I want you and Zari to QB.

91
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,096
Oh, you don't have to tell me
to Queen Bee,

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,538
it'll occur naturally.

93
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:07,541
You know what? Hong Kong traffic
is notoriously bad.

94
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,962
- So why don't we take my new scooter?
- Whoa!

95
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,672
I call her...

96
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,216
Scoots McGoots.

97
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,029
- Dude!
- That's so awesome.

98
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,140
The scooter, you're all impressed by?

99
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,434
Oh, my God. I need one.

100
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,810
Wanna go for a ride?

101
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:27,978
- Yeah.
- Yes.

102
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,605
Ooh!

103
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,691
Away we go.

104
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay, I'm next.

105
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:34,942
Careful!

106
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,587
- Slow down.
- All right, speed her up.

107
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,611
Nate. Nate?

108
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,879
Never been to Hong Kong before.

109
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,089
So, what's the plan?

110
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,468
I had Gideon cook up
the same sedative she dosed John with.

111
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,095
All we have to do is inject the Encore

112
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,739
and bring him back to the ship
for nap time.

113
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:04,681
One problem.

114
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,118
We're just supposed
to hope the Encore shows up

115
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,141
looking for a cuppa?

116
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,644
This is no ordinary tea shop.

117
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,107
It's owned by the Triad.

118
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,116
Nate, how's the perimeter sweep?

119
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,822
No sign of a gangster from Hell yet.

120
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,283
So it looks like we've arrived

121
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,619
right as Great Britain
was getting ready to hand control

122
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,204
of Hong Kong back to China.

123
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:30,707
Oh, that's probably not pertinent
but keep up the research.

124
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,877
- Psst.
- Gary! What are you doing here?

125
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,229
John's trying to leave the ship!

126
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,630
You have to stop him!

127
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,633
You should return
to the MedBay, Mr. Constantine.

128
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,593
John, what are you doing out and about?

129
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,094
Oh, listen, big man.

130
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,239
Look, I know you're only
trying to help, all right,

131
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:48,558
but nobody gets Stage IV
lung cancer this fast.

132
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:52,312
Some sneaky git with a grudge against me
is bending the rules of magic.

133
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,022
Oh, who could hate you that much?

134
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,149
The list is long.

135
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,444
I'm taking the Jumpship
home to narrow it.

136
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,030
John, no, I cannot
let you leave this ship.

137
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,074
You are in need of medical supervision.

138
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,868
You can't let me?

139
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,746
You forget who I am, old son.

140
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,252
Fine.

141
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,380
But I'm going with you.

142
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,757
Hallelujah!

143
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,509
That was intense.

144
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,348
The Encore's a no-show.

145
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:29,641
<i>I say we split.</i>

146
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,093
Thirteenth-century armor,

147
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,095
Fu Manchu mustache.

148
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,597
Guys.

149
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,683
<i>I think I know who the Encore is.</i>

150
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,313
<i>It's Genghis freaking Khan.</i>

151
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,993
How the hell did Genghis Khan
get to 1997

152
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,536
and learn how to ride a motorbike?

153
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:35,040
Genghis used horses
to revolutionize warfare.

154
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,835
A motorbike's the modern-day horse!

155
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,962
Looks like he's meeting with the Triad.

156
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,521
What sort of man steals my drugs

157
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,732
and my nephew's ear

158
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,777
only to return them to me?

159
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,363
I have only one interest.

160
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,074
Conquest.

161
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,035
Surrender the Triad to me

162
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,496
and I will remake the globe.

163
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,581
And if I refuse?

164
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,961
We're not getting in that room.

165
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,254
We should abort.

166
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,464
<i>Regroup on the ship.</i>

167
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,941
What, and stay in Hong Kong longer?

168
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,926
Give me the syringe. Let's finish this.

169
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,598
B, I'm gonna need a distraction.

170
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:34,808
It's too dangerous.

171
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,101
Any moment.

172
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,561
Charlie, stop. Don't do this!

173
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:40,689
Behrad!

174
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,326
We're the cops.

175
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,786
Freeze, jackass.

176
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,838
Great distraction, B.

177
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:14,639
No!

178
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:21,187
Genghis is leaving. I'm going after him!

179
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,479
Charlie, wait!

180
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:43,751
Charlie?

181
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,607
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

182
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,858
Drop your guns!

183
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,321
Shoot him!

184
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,421
- Huh?
- Nice timing.

185
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,217
Scoots.

186
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,096
Shoot him!

187
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,599
- He's immortal.
- And I'm not!

188
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,063
You're lucky.

189
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,485
Maybe next time, not so lucky.

190
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:02,956
Gary, bring me the foxglove,
a serpent's tongue,

191
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,666
and the hair of an albino.

192
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,211
John, need some water?

193
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,294
Bollocks.

194
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,463
No, mate.

195
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,715
Just do me a favor
and pull up the rug.

196
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,009
What are you planning?

197
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,221
A summoning spell.

198
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,140
I'm gonna throttle the bastard
that did this to me.

199
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,475
Are you really up for that?

200
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,644
No two-bit demon
is getting the better of me.

201
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:28,648
I'm John Constantine,
and I am devious to the core.

202
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,233
I added honey just how you like it.

203
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,316
Good. Now, give it here.

204
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:50,211
Johnny.

205
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:54,883
Show your face.

206
00:11:55,675 --> 00:12:00,138
The great John Constantine,
brought to his knees.

207
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:05,393
There are denizens of Heaven and Hell
who would kill to see this.

208
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,525
Surprise.

209
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,159
Astra, why?

210
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,536
You're bad for business, John.

211
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,622
The cancer was already in your lungs.

212
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,916
I just... sped it up.

213
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,460
Astra, this magic
is way beyond you, love.

214
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,669
Look, whoever helped you,

215
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,088
whatever you promised them
in exchange, trust me,

216
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:35,172
it's a trap.

217
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,092
I'll keep that in mind.

218
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:43,348
You know, I would have expected
your purgatory to be a little more...

219
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:46,643
gruesome.

220
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,937
You don't remember this place, then.

221
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,940
Your mother brought you here.

222
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,442
So that's your angle.

223
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,861
I knew you'd try something, John.

224
00:12:56,945 --> 00:13:00,531
Astra, I can change your mother's fate.

225
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:05,411
All right? She never dies.
You never go to Hell. Your dad, he...

226
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:09,415
He never drowns his sorrow in booze.
Your family can be whole again.

227
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,085
Tempting.

228
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,546
But everyone you try to help...

229
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,883
you hurt.

230
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,235
But this is different, all right?

231
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,804
I know someone who has a lead
on a very powerful artifact.

232
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,098
"I know someone."

233
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:28,476
John, listen to yourself. It's pathetic.

234
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,562
No, what is pathetic is that
someone who is so content to rule Hell

235
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:34,816
because they're too scared
to make a go at a real life.

236
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,777
Look, this is what Natalie wanted, love.

237
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:39,403
I just...

238
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:40,989
I need a little more time.

239
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,116
Time is something you're running low on.

240
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,537
Oh, thank God.

241
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:50,747
No.

242
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,508
The man upstairs
had nothing to do with this.

243
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,918
It was Astra.

244
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,087
She owns the chip to my soul.

245
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,631
She's figured out a way
how to spin down the dial

246
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,049
on the time I have left.

247
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,051
Thanks, man.

248
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,720
John, I'm sorry.

249
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,096
Cheer up, lads.

250
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,807
This dog is still in the fight.

251
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,892
That went well.

252
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,352
My Queen Bee-ing, I mean.

253
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,271
You four almost got yourselves killed.

254
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,939
- I had fun.
- "Fun"?

255
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,108
You got us stuck
in the middle of a shoot-out.

256
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,028
It's why I love Bruce Lee.
He never uses guns.

257
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,831
Keep your knickers on.
You have wind powers.

258
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,549
You could have
just stopped the bullets midair.

259
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:24,741
Stop bullets?

260
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,366
You're crazy.

261
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,430
Look, this is all my fault.
We should have been gathering intel,

262
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,664
not doping the Encore. Gideon.

263
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:34,018
I'm currently tracking
Genghis Khan's whereabouts

264
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,293
via his license plate.

265
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,670
Great. 'Cause we need to figure out
how and why

266
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,298
Genghis just showed up
in 1997 Hong Kong.

267
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,050
Charlie, you up for
some undercover work?

268
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,736
Oh, I get it. Just because
I'm the shapeshifter,

269
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,529
I have to be the one
to infiltrate the criminal gang.

270
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:48,473
Sorry, pause. Uh, you're a shapeshifter?

271
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,141
Yeah. I am, actually.

272
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,269
I can shift into anyone you like.

273
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,395
Anyone?

274
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,439
- Yeah, anyone.
- All right, come on.

275
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,151
Where's Mick? I'm gonna get a drink.

276
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,070
- I need a smoke.
- I...

277
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,239
I don't get it.
They used to be best buds.

278
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,158
Oh, there's only one explanation.

279
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,119
B and Charlie went to pound town.

280
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,622
Ew. Gross.

281
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,623
Wait, what?

282
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:14,624
Moan zone?

283
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,793
Smash city?

284
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:17,834
Ava.

285
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,378
They had sex?

286
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,452
- All right, guys. I'll see you in a bit.
- Charlie.

287
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:52,995
Oh, here we go. Another lecture.

288
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,747
No, I just...

289
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,164
Be careful.

290
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,262
She won't talk.

291
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,017
Ah, the hero cop from the tea house.

292
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,020
Ava, are you there?

293
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,547
Yeah, Charlie. You find something?

294
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,440
<i>Genghis kidnapped your cop friend.</i>

295
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,737
What do we have here?

296
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,657
Only one child?

297
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,534
How unambitious.

298
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,452
Nevertheless,

299
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,875
give me what I desire
and I will spare his life.

300
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,339
John, Nora's here.

301
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,925
All right, I'm coming.

302
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,350
Okay, Pippa,

303
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,687
can you wish our friend John healthy,
like we discussed?

304
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes, but I want something first.

305
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,942
Pippa's made a lot of progress

306
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,445
but we're still working
on a few challenges.

307
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:08,862
Hey!

308
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,283
The Master of the Dark Arts
needs your help!

309
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,243
Shut up, four eyes.

310
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,495
Now you listen to me, you little squirt.

311
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,249
Now you're gonna make that damn wish
because if you don't and I die,

312
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:25,379
then I'm gonna come back and haunt you
every waking hour of your life.

313
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,842
Fairy Godmother, I wish your scary
British friend wasn't sick!

314
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,594
There you go. Easy.

315
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,428
Okay.

316
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,536
Ah, no matter.

317
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,538
I'll try something else.

318
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,208
I wish I was home!

319
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,417
Sorry.

320
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:06,336
Bye, Ray.

321
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:10,883
Bye, Nora.

322
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,683
So, when did
you and Charlie, you know...

323
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,353
- It's that obvious?
- Mmm-hmm.

324
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,522
After Heyworld.

325
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,983
Wow. That's nice.

326
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,713
- How was it? She shapeshift?
- That's what you want to talk about?

327
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:32,863
100%, but we don't have to.

328
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,450
Look, Charlie's clearly affecting you,

329
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,035
so come on, talk to me.

330
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:39,745
- It's stupid.
- What?

331
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,498
She left without saying goodbye.

332
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,874
Mmm.

333
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,167
Yeah, that sucks.

334
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,171
But if you were thousands of years old,
wouldn't you be over goodbyes?

335
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,299
The least she could've done is texted.

336
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,175
How hard is it to send a ghost emoji?

337
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,678
Maybe it wasn't about you.

338
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,726
Dum-dum's got a good point.

339
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,979
B, chin up. You are a catch.

340
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,939
If there was a female version of you,

341
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,816
I would be all over her. Fact.

342
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,568
Like my sister?

343
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,569
Absolutely.

344
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,654
But the point is,

345
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,947
we don't know why Charlie
didn't say goodbye.

346
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,574
So just check your ego...

347
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,408
and ask her.

348
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,286
You're right.

349
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,705
- Thanks, Nate.
- My man.

350
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,003
Where's our prisoner?

351
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,974
Even with Prince Charles' motorcade
route, he'll be heavily guarded.

352
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,036
<i>Wait.
Prince Charles is the target?</i>

353
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,854
He's here to hand Hong Kong
back to China.

354
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,691
What if the Khan wants Prince Charles
to give it to him instead?

355
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,194
An authoritarian power
wants to control Hong Kong.

356
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,612
It sounds familiar.

357
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,165
The worst part of my resurrection

358
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:11,045
was finding myself buried
in an impenetrable tomb.

359
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,050
It took me 700 years to dig myself out.

360
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:26,060
The best part of my resurrection
was the sword I was buried with.

361
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,483
Genghis just killed a cop
with a Hell weapon.

362
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,692
Son of a bitch.

363
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,404
Okay, you got what we needed, Charlie.
Get the hell out of there.

364
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:39,656
Yeung.

365
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,744
What is the status of my fleet?

366
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,747
Your fleet?

367
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,377
The one you are building
to conquer the globe.

368
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,128
Right.

369
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:54,964
Fleet's great.

370
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,383
In fact, I have to go
check on it right now.

371
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,022
Don't freak out. I can explain.

372
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,195
Never mind.

373
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,657
<i>Clotho...</i>

374
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,785
<i>No matter what face you wear,</i>

375
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,788
<i>you can't hide from us.</i>

376
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,213
No! Leave me alone!

377
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,431
Are you okay?

378
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:46,807
Yeah.

379
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:47,933
I'm fine.

380
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,327
So? What's the verdict? Can you heal me?

381
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,040
Well, then, screw you.

382
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,792
Come with me.

383
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,876
He didn't mean that.

384
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,212
Yeah, I did.

385
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,177
I wish you would let us
take you to the oncologist.

386
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,346
Raymond, how many times
do I have to tell you,

387
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,891
this is a disease caused by magic
and only magic can fix it.

388
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,312
"How to add years to your life"?
Ah, that should do it.

389
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,857
Although the ingredient list
is a little unusual.

390
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,817
We'll need a medieval knight.

391
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,488
I was once knighted
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

392
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,533
Great. Gary, grab a knife.

393
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,119
We're gonna perform a little
back-alley surgery on the big man.

394
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,288
Uh, what kind of surgery?

395
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,415
Well, first off, are you uncircumcised?

396
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,751
- I... I...
- Well, I'll take that as a yes.

397
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,378
- Gary, the knife.
- No!

398
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,132
We tried Nora, we tried the Púca.

399
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,345
What if there isn't a cure?

400
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,015
Isn't there anyone you...
that you need to say goodbye to?

401
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,851
What about a bucket list?

402
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,524
Goodbyes are for saps

403
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,026
and bucket lists
are for mealy-mouthed cowards

404
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,154
who don't have the courage
to <i>carpe</i> the bloody <i>diem.</i>

405
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,031
I have a bucket list.

406
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,450
Thank you for proving my point, Raymond.

407
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,204
Stop being so mean.
We're trying to help you.

408
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,622
- Help me?
- Yes.

409
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,791
Captain America and the village idiot?

410
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,042
Well, I don't need your help.

411
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,086
I take care of myself. I always have.

412
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,213
What, you think
I'm gonna let Astra beat me?

413
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:43,507
I will fight and I will scheme

414
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,093
and I will make a deal
with the archangel himself.

415
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,554
You hear that, Gabriel, eh?

416
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,222
Come and get me.

417
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,891
Have I got an offer for you.

418
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,858
Looks like he's not coming.

419
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,777
I'll think of something. I always do.

420
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,946
Now piss off,
I've had enough of the pair of you.

421
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,448
Go on, piss off!

422
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,248
Hello.

423
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,292
Who the hell are you?

424
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,044
I am the last queen of France.

425
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,255
Right. Just when I thought this ship
couldn't get more barmy.

426
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,011
Looking for a Time Courier?

427
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,392
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave... again?

428
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:37,811
You know me.
Always looking for the next party.

429
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,647
Usually I would buy that...

430
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,399
but you just almost walked into a truck.

431
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,942
Something has you spooked.

432
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,320
Is whatever's going on
the reason why you left?

433
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,363
Here we go.

434
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:48,656
Look, I'll admit it.

435
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:49,865
I liked you.

436
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,327
I was hurt when you left

437
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,121
and I've felt weird
ever since you returned.

438
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:57,873
Now, can you be honest with me?

439
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,083
Honestly...

440
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,753
you are starting to piss me off.

441
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,005
We had sex and it was mediocre.

442
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,089
Get over it.

443
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,969
Wow. Okay, I'm gonna ignore that.

444
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,889
If you don't want to talk, fine.

445
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,850
But we're about to go up
against Genghis Khan.

446
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,143
Don't leave now.

447
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,189
Just give me the Courier.

448
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,115
Bye, Charlie.

449
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,495
Mediocre is not bad.

450
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,333
Charlie's gone?

451
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,502
- How could you let her leave?
- I didn't.

452
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,795
It was her choice.

453
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,631
Okay. Hey, how about we focus
on Genghis Khan?

454
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:48,631
You're right.

455
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,051
We need to stop him from
attacking Prince Charles' motorcade.

456
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:55,431
But He is on his way to a ceremony
ending 156 years of colonial rule, so...

457
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,766
Have you been researching history?

458
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,727
Oh, sorry. That's your thing, right?

459
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,520
- No. But...
- Okay.

460
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,605
- Okay, okay. Moving on, right?
- Hmm?

461
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,191
Turns out the person
Charlie impersonated is an engineer.

462
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,419
There's a shipment coming in tonight.

463
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,671
I'll bet you that's the fleet
Genghis uses for his attack.

464
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,821
What kind of fleet?

465
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,615
Whatever it is, it's the next step
of modern warfare.

466
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,038
I'll go to the docks,
I'll try to figure it out.

467
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,161
Okay.

468
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,389
Zari and I will monitor
the airspace above the motorcade

469
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,413
and you'll be on the street.

470
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,684
I know it's a lot of ground to cover.
If Charlie was here...

471
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,752
I get it. I'm on my own.

472
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:34,094
I can't believe you stooped
to trying to make a deal with an angel.

473
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,517
Gabriel would have turned you
into his slave.

474
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,561
Well, at least I'd be alive.

475
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,481
There are worse fates
than death.

476
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:47,607
Oi.

477
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,321
I will shove you where the sun
don't shine just to shut you up.

478
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,323
You'd probably enjoy that.

479
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,369
Hell of a way to spend
your last nights on Earth, though,

480
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,038
you arrogant bastard.

481
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,540
Especially when you could be

482
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,335
with two of the only friends
you have left.

483
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,716
Yeah. Nice one.

484
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,312
I... I just feel so helpless, you know?

485
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,815
Me, too, Gary.

486
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,942
If he has to go, I just...

487
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,944
I want him to be at peace.

488
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,821
Well, that's not his style.

489
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,656
John's gonna go out the way he lived.

490
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,783
Like a bloody wanker, eh?

491
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,161
You know, it occurs to me

492
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,831
that I might owe you two
a bit of an apology.

493
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,582
We accept.

494
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,792
Okay.

495
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,293
Go on, sit down.

496
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,017
All right.
Okay, you're hurting me. Go on.

497
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,214
Sit down. Stop bloody fussing, will you?

498
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,389
You know, I can't remember the last time
this room was used as an actual kitchen.

499
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,599
Well, there's roast in the oven.

500
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,561
- It'll be ready soon.
- Mmm.

501
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,441
Did I ever tell you both

502
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:15,696
about the time I met
the ghost of Winston Churchill?

503
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,591
<i>Behrad, what's your status?</i>

504
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,288
It's complete gridlock.

505
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,248
No one's getting through
on the ground.

506
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,725
- The fleet must be in the air.
- Nate,

507
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,167
<i>did you find the shipment?</i>

508
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,838
Oh, no.

509
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,005
<i>We're too late.</i>

510
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,508
<i>Whatever there was,
there was a lot of 'em.</i>

511
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,760
Nate, get downtown and help Behrad.

512
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:39,802
<i>Hold up.</i>

513
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,513
I think they might have left something.

514
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,604
What's that noise?

515
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,735
Oh, my God.

516
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,244
Scoots.

517
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,415
Khan!

518
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,352
Charge!

519
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,445
They're getting through the gridlock
on their scooters!

520
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,374
<i>Heading straight
for Prince Charles' motorcade.</i>

521
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,547
Stay down, Your Majesty!

522
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,091
Turn here!

523
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,567
I could really use some help!

524
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,403
Nate, tell me you're close, please.

525
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,989
I'd be lying.

526
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,783
B, it's your time. You got this.

527
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,907
Protect the Prince!

528
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,587
Get down! Take cover!

529
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:38,629
Look out!

530
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,770
Not again.

531
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,650
Look who it is.

532
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,030
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you,
Prince Charles.

533
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,531
It's not your fault.

534
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:08,577
But my friends call me Charlie.

535
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,583
Apprehend this imposter.

536
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,298
Show your true form or I end him.

537
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,432
Looks like your luck has run out,
shapeshifter.

538
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,060
Where is the Prince?

539
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:34,936
Sorry, Gengi.

540
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,022
He's somewhere you'll never find him.

541
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:41,693
Your shapeshifting friend

542
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:45,072
said you need to tell your team
that I'm here.

543
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,282
And I told her, I'm on my beer break.

544
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:50,660
Now, shut up, princess, and listen.

545
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,540
I've never met
one of your kind before.

546
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,257
You will be my 13th wife.

547
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,884
Come again, mate?

548
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,428
Your power will serve my reign well.

549
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:14,351
Join me, as I build a new empire
that will span the globe.

550
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:15,935
Look, I'm flattered,

551
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,563
but I've had power of immortals
and gods alike.

552
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,815
It blows.

553
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,860
My past is complicated.

554
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,321
And being in a relationship...

555
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,158
Trust me, that wouldn't end well
for either of us.

556
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,368
Wait.

557
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,914
Did you two sleep together or something?

558
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,752
Oh. What a shame.

559
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,877
Kill her!

560
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
What?

561
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,255
No.

562
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:45,589
Come on.

563
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,631
Unless you lot want those bullets
firing back at ya...

564
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,925
bugger off.

565
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,846
Run away! Run away!

566
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,391
Run away! Run away!

567
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,934
I told you could stop bullets!

568
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,269
Not how I wanted to find out.

569
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,188
Come here.

570
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,194
- Yeah, that was sick.
- I know.

571
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,196
Is that Genghis' toothpick?

572
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,322
Yeah, you want it?

573
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,965
Ugh, no, it's disgusting.

574
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,373
You said you were gonna tell us
what's really going on with you.

575
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,793
Look, I'm just... I'm still trying
to find the words, all right?

576
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,587
Can you try to find them faster?

577
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,046
Fine.

578
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,342
I'm just gonna come out with it.

579
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,636
I am a Fate.

580
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,849
One of the three old Greek ladies?

581
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:21,102
That's offensive, but correct.

582
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,186
Which one are you?

583
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,481
Clotho, the spinner.

584
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:28,068
I'm super-confused,
but what do you spin?

585
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:32,072
Look, I don't spin anything anymore
but I used to spin people's futures.

586
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:33,949
On your loom.

587
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,076
Oh, lovely.
Even Gideon's joining in. Yes.

588
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,828
There was a loom, but I
destroyed it thousands of years ago.

589
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,998
No one should have that kind of power.

590
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,501
I think people should just decide
their own destinies.

591
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,086
Why didn't you just tell us?

592
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,673
Look, I've been keeping this secret for
my entire bloody existence. All right?

593
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,508
I've never told anyone.

594
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,387
Can we see your OG form?

595
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,513
Absolutely not.

596
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,431
Is it 'cause you're old?

597
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,159
It's because your eyes will explode,
all right?

598
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,119
And your ears, too,
if you could hear my original voice.

599
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,228
Why are you running?

600
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,648
My sisters are coming after me.

601
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,571
They have been
ever since I destroyed our loom.

602
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,194
Wait, you've been running
for thousands of years?

603
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,322
Yes. And I've always stayed
one step ahead.

604
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,760
I scattered the loom pieces
across the multi-verse,

605
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,494
which took away my sisters' powers.

606
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,205
But now that we're all in one universe,

607
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,000
thanks to Sara
and her merry band of Paragons,

608
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,002
the Loom pieces are back on one plane.

609
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,297
And now it's only a matter of time
until my sisters find me.

610
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,090
And when they do?

611
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,051
They'll kill me
and anyone that I'm with.

612
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,179
Which is why I left.

613
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,310
And it's why I'm out that door now
that we're done playing "Ask a Fate."

614
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,063
Stop running.

615
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,732
We got your back.

616
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,279
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

617
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,324
My sisters are no joke.

618
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,284
Well, we're the Legends.

619
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:00,493
Yeah.

620
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,204
We can take out a couple old ladies.

621
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:14,299
What is with all these damn scooters?
They're a menace!

622
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,136
Oh. Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

623
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,781
Well, I lost my scooter at first.

624
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,016
But the good news is,
don't worry about it, I found it.

625
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,814
John, this wine is delicious.

626
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,483
And nutritious.

627
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:35,195
Well, there's no point
in saving the good stuff, eh?

628
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,905
I'm never gonna drink with you again.

629
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,240
Come on, mate. Stiff upper lip, eh?

630
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,076
I'm gonna miss you so much, you know?

631
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,952
Nothing can make me feel better.

632
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,305
Oh, bollocks, all right.

633
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:45,329
Look.

634
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,541
I didn't want you
to see my will until I died, but...

635
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,754
Raymond, if you'd do the honors.

636
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:53,880
Uh, sure.

637
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,635
You're giving this house to Gary?

638
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,768
Bloody hell. That was supposed
to make you happy, not insufferable.

639
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,145
I promise to take great care
of this place.

640
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,232
You know, I'll feed the Hell hounds,
I'll vacuum...

641
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:16,444
Why don't we talk about what you had
on your bucket list, eh, Ray?

642
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,655
- Really?
- Yeah.

643
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,407
Give me something meaningful, ey.

644
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,869
Well, uh, eventually...

645
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,374
I plan on asking Nora to marry me.

646
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,294
Can I be your flower boy?

647
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:38,550
Oh. That's very sweet, Gary.
Odd, but very sweet.

648
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,010
Why haven't you asked her yet, big man?

649
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,889
I've been engaged twice before.

650
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,643
Both times didn't end as I had hoped.

651
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,562
You know, life, it is...

652
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,815
too short to dilly-dally, Raymond.

653
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,528
You can take that from a man
who has nothing but regrets.

654
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,906
So, if you love that witch...

655
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,201
you bloody well marry her, all right?

656
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:12,459
- No, no, no, I'm all right.
- I'm all right.

657
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,918
Now, how about a toast, ey?

658
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,088
Okay.

659
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,839
No, no.

660
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,886
Of all the ways that I thought I'd go...

661
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:28,224
decapitated by a demon,
eviscerated by an elemental...

662
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,728
I wouldn't have picked
being at home with my mates.

663
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,355
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

664
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,356
Cheers.

665
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:39,819
Cheers.

666
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,255
You know, I just wish
I had more time with you lovely idiots.

667
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,383
Well, you're not dead yet, John.

668
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,928
No, but I will be momentarily.

669
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:13,645
John Constantine...

670
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:17,982
he always goes out
on his own terms.

671
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,775
John?

672
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:26,950
Couldn't wait to see me, John.

673
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,453
Sixty seconds and you're dead.

674
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,082
Poison does that.

675
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:41,047
It's the same poison
your mother used to kill herself.

676
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,634
You won't change my mind.

677
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,761
I'm not trying to.

678
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,014
I just want you to know that

679
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,309
even though you gave up on her,

680
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,604
your mom never gave up on you.

681
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:08,533
<i>Are you going to Scarborough Fair?</i>

682
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:13,496
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</i>

683
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:15,622
Stop.

684
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:19,002
<i>Remember me to one who lives there</i>

685
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:23,756
<i>For once she was a true love of mine</i>

686
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,175
That was our song!

687
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,260
Aye, it was.

688
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,222
But she sang it to me first.

689
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:36,185
You can really bring her back?

690
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,108
Answer me!

691
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,027
I can fix everything.

692
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,875
I'm glad that hurt.

693
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,712
Tick-tock, John.

694
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,716
I can kill you anytime I want.

695
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,054
Oh, my God!

696
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,930
I can't take this anymore.

697
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:13,930
You're alive.

698
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,559
Astra, she reconsidered.

699
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,520
She reconsidered.
She reconsidered. She reconsidered.

700
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,022
She reconsidered!

701
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,815
I can't bloody believe it.

702
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,233
I'm back in the game!

703
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,361
Oh, bully. Bully, Bully, Bully!

704
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,905
I love you!
Bully, Bully, Bully, Bully, Bully!

705
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:31,491
Yes, I can't believe
she bloody reconsidered!

706
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,994
I feel like a new man.

707
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,331
I can't believe
I was gonna leave my house to you.

708
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,375
- What?
- Here, give me that will.

709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,169
How did you get Astra
to change her mind?

710
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:46,964
By making a promise...

711
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:49,258
that I intend to keep.

712
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,514
Hail the <i>Waverider.</i>

713
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:57,600
I need to see a lady about a loom.
