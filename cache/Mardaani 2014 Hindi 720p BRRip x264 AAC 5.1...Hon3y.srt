1
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:48,000
Wireless crackling
with instructions.

2
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,458
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

3
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,167
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

4
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,083
It's always crowded here.

5
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,375
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

6
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,375
Look at that... you scum!

7
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,250
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

8
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,625
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

9
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,708
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

10
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,125
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

11
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,667
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,583
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,458
Boss is in a bad mood today.

14
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,333
He's pissed with everyone.

15
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,292
His wife must've screamt at him

16
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,250
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

17
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,167
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

18
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:05,042
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,375
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

20
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,458
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

21
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:13,625
So true, Ma'am.

22
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,208
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

24
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:19,667
Yes, Ma'am.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,542
How is your younger
one studying?

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,167
Wonder when she studies!

27
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,667
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

28
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,792
That reminds me...

29
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,792
Hello.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,083
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

31
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,292
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,458
I can hear the TV.

33
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,292
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

34
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,167
- Have you got it?
- What?

35
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,792
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,000
I was speaking to Jafar.

37
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:45,875
Okay.

38
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,583
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,083
Okay, bye.

40
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,042
Have you fed them?

41
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,083
They are getting a royal treatment.

42
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,625
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

43
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,083
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

44
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,292
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

45
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,000
These guys love cheese.

46
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,417
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

47
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

48
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,250
Shinde...

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,542
The baby's crying...

50
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:49,917
Oh my God!

51
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,708
You son of a...

52
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:54,833
Get up!

53
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,042
Bloody rascal!

54
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,375
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

55
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,375
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

56
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,333
We are not going to shoot you.

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,250
Please, Ma'am...

58
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,125
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

59
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,292
I have to take you in alive.

60
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,625
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,000
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,500
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

63
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,375
Get him!

64
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,542
You son of a...

65
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,833
You have dodged us
four times before.

66
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,417
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,583
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

68
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,583
Take him away!

69
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,500
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

70
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,375
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

71
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,208
You could at least
make love one last time.

72
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,667
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

73
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,333
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

74
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:19,625
Sir's call.

75
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,208
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

76
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,750
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

77
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,083
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,792
...not barge right inside the chawl.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,292
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

80
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,458
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

81
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,417
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

82
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,208
But who would be responsible...

83
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,667
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

84
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,292
We had taken precautions, Sir.

85
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,167
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

86
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,583
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

87
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,667
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

88
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:50,500
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

89
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,125
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

90
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,833
Go home, Ma'am.

91
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,542
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

92
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,750
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

93
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,917
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

94
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,208
No chance, Ma'am.

95
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

96
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,042
You have a look at it.

97
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:24,792
Okay.

98
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,000
Sorry, I am late again.

99
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,042
It's okay.

100
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,542
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

101
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,375
Sorry"-

102
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,875
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

103
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,792
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

104
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,375
For me?

105
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,250
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,458
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

107
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,292
Yes.

108
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,417
Happy birthday to you...

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,542
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

110
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,208
Happy birthday to you.

111
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,042
This is for Meera.

112
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,000
And for me? Come on...

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,542
Fast, fast, fast.

114
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,458
And this is for you.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

116
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,625
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

117
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,750
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

118
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,375
Hey, hey!

119
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,708
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

120
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,125
Show me something else.

121
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,417
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

122
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,083
I have a lot of variety.

123
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,208
Try this one.

124
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,708
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

125
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,083
He was a cop just like you.

126
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,542
Roam around in style with these.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,375
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

128
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,000
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

129
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,333
But that one doesn't have a glass.

130
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,083
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

131
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,167
But don't worry Ma'am.

132
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,625
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

133
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,417
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

134
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,000
What the hell is going on there?

135
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,000
Go check Morey.

136
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,125
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

137
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,792
Why do we need to get into it?

138
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,167
Morey, we are from
the crime branch later.

139
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,917
We are cops first. Let's go.

140
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,042
Let's go.

141
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,750
Ma'am, goggles...

142
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,125
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

143
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,417
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

144
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:56,083
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do ourjob.

145
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,417
Get lost!

146
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,167
Only one of us can
do ourjob right now.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,458
And right now, I am on duty.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,125
So, you stop working
and let me work.

149
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,417
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

150
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,667
You guys keep 90mg!

151
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,042
Last warning.

152
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
You and your bloody last warning!

153
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,583
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

154
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,750
Start counting, Morey.

155
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,000
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

156
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,833
Section 147 - rioting.

157
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,083
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

158
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,542
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

159
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,792
...to provoke breach of peace.

160
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,500
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

161
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,208
Get up!

162
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,458
Two more sections left. Get up!

163
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,542
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

164
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,625
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

165
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,292
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

166
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,875
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

167
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,083
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

168
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,125
Yes, Ma'am.

169
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,000
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

170
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,458
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

171
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,708
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

172
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,417
Unit 3.

173
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,500
Do whatever the hell you want!

174
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,375
Get lost!

175
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,625
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

176
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,917
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

177
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,042
No, no. Give it for thirty.

178
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,458
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

179
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,792
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

180
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,125
Okay.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,583
Pyaan!

182
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,750
Pyaari! Come here!

183
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,000
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

184
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,000
Here's a twenty... thirty...

185
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,000
Pyaari, come quickly!

186
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,000
Coming!

187
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,417
Keep the change.

188
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,250
Pyaari, get in.

189
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,375
How are you?

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,542
There it is.

191
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,667
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

192
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,375
lam going to treat
both of you this Friday.

193
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,000
Really? Why?

194
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,083
It's my birthday.

195
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,833
- Really?
- No.

196
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,375
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

197
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:15,542
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

198
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,792
Very smart.

199
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,625
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

200
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,583
...then even we must too, right?

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,667
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

202
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:24,750
Kaalakhatta.

203
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,000
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

204
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,208
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

205
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

206
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,458
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

207
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:35,375
Me too.

208
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
You too? Same pinch.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,333
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

210
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,375
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

211
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,458
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

212
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,542
Aunty, but you met me, right?

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,042
My Ganpati selected you for me.

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,250
And me?

215
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
You, I have selected myself!

216
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,000
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

217
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,208
Just a second. I am on my last set.

218
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,542
Again?

219
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,542
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

220
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,417
What happened?

221
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:24,000
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Really.

223
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

224
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,417
There will be one more today.

225
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,125
Why?

226
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,125
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

227
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,792
Its been three days,
I just can't find her.

228
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,875
So a new cake every day?

229
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,167
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

230
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,583
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

231
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,375
Very good.

232
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, Jafar.

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I'll handle that.

234
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,375
You keep the charge sheet ready.

235
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,542
I'll come in some time.

236
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,833
Yes, Jafar.

237
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,708
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,583
Who are you?

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,625
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

240
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,208
Who is Shivani Aunty?

241
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,125
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

242
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,167
Did you find her?

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,458
- Who?
- Her.

244
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,083
Who's her?

245
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,917
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

246
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,583
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

247
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,333
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

248
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,292
Who let these kids inside?

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,833
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,042
She's missing since
the last four days.

251
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,458
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,042
These kids wander off sometimes.

253
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,417
But they come back
in a couple of days.

254
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,125
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,083
...so we filed a missing complaint.

256
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

257
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,250
This is D. N. Nagar...

258
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,583
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
When did you see her last?

260
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,042
Four days back.

261
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,708
I want to meet these kids.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,292
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

263
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,250
She was with us
three days ago. And...

264
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,458
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

265
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,250
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

266
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,750
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

267
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,042
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

268
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,042
I haven't seen her after that.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,458
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

270
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,792
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

271
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,583
She was carrying her bag of books.

272
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,500
I even asked her
where she was going.

273
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,542
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

274
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,833
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

275
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,000
One cup of tea

276
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,542
Since when do you
have your stall here?

277
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,625
What's the matter Ma'am?
ls anything wrong?

278
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,083
Just answer my question.

279
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,208
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

280
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,250
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

281
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,042
What's the job?

282
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,042
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

283
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,000
Who comes in, who goes out.

284
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,250
You want me to be
an informer, right?

285
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,917
You are very smart, huh?

286
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,458
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

287
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,458
Give me all the
information you can get.

288
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,333
Clear?

289
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
Write my number down.

290
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,333
9-8-2...

291
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,458
Meera, are you ready?

292
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,250
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

293
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,583
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

294
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,292
Yes, Sir.

295
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
Let me comb your hair today.

296
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,000
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

297
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,083
You need a good hair-cut.

298
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,250
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

299
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,917
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

300
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,792
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

301
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,000
Pyaari is missing since five days.

302
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,292
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

303
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:07,875
She has been kidnapped.

304
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,750
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

305
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,208
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

306
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,875
There's no network inside.

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,500
So he comes out to take his calls.

308
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,792
Something about dealings...

309
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,250
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

310
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,708
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He has clicked mine too.

312
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,250
Where would he be right now?

313
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,375
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

314
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,250
Kapiu

315
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,583
What are you up to?

316
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,792
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

317
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,917
Heading home? I'll drop you.

318
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,375
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

319
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,000
It's no bother. Come, sit.

320
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,000
Come.

321
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,375
Come sit.

322
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,000
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

323
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,333
Whose call is it? Answer it.

324
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,542
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

325
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,542
Your family is missing you, huh?

326
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,500
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

327
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,292
Anyway...

328
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,583
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

329
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,375
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,708
Take a good one.

331
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,708
Done? Show me.

332
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,292
What a phone you have there!

333
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,333
Ma'am, take a look.

334
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,000
Latest mobile.

335
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,000
Wow!

336
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,417
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

337
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,125
Peanuts!

338
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,625
We should also quit
our jobs and join an NGO.

339
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,208
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

340
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,917
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

341
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,083
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

342
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,167
Don't play dumb. We know.

343
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,792
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

344
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,583
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

345
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:54,750
Good idea, Ma'am.

346
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,208
Speak up. Who do you work for?

347
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,375
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

348
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,833
Why are you stretching it?

349
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,500
We are in an 'instant' era.

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,542
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

351
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,250
Come on speak up.

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,583
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

353
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,583
Where is she?

354
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,292
Speak UP, you scum!

355
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,875
He's just pretending.

356
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,542
You are messing with my head now!

357
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,333
Are you done?

358
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,250
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,667
There they are!

360
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,167
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

361
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,167
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

362
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,750
Morey keep his mobile.

363
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,083
Move aside!

364
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,625
Move!

365
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,000
The other shooter.

366
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,333
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

367
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,292
Damn!

368
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,292
Pyaari, where are you my child!

369
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,208
Come here.

370
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,542
Move.

371
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,000
Stop fooling around, guys!

372
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,833
Come on.

373
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,542
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

374
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,667
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

375
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,625
Will you rip it or should I?

376
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,250
- Come on.
- No, please no!

377
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,458
Come here.

378
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,542
No!

379
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,417
Get her.

380
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,000
Come on. Stand straight, you!

381
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,417
lam telling you for the last time.

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't do this to me.

383
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,417
Please!

384
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,583
Easy, Mattu!

385
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:11,250
Take it off!

386
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:25,167
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

387
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,583
In spite of you around?

388
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,042
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

389
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,458
Put her in No. 2.

390
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,542
Baby Doll!

391
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,542
Come here to Papa. Come.

392
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:38,542
Hey!

393
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,125
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

394
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,042
Are you insane?!

395
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,875
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

396
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,083
Myself. I will slash myself.

397
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,167
Don't slash your wrists.

398
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,500
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

399
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,500
Loretto School, Kolkata, huh?

400
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,917
Her school is very famous.

401
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,542
I was in Hindu College.

402
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,917
Dropped out in the second year.

403
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,625
But that I can help you with.

404
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:13,208
No really.

405
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:18,083
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

406
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,125
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

407
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,083
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

408
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,000
Because you have seen me.

409
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,250
What's her name?

410
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:30,833
Mrunal.

411
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,292
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

412
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,625
You either work for me...

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,042
Don't come, don't come.

414
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,250
Chill. It's okay.

415
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,333
Or I will have to kill you.

416
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,500
What were you about to do?

417
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,250
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

418
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,667
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

419
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:57,083
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

420
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,500
In front of all the girls.

421
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,375
ls that what you want?

422
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,875
But what to do?

423
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,833
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

424
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,083
And that leaves us
with our last option.

425
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,833
If you want to stay alive...

426
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:17,542
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

427
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,833
You are quite hot, you know.

428
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,167
I can get you the best clients.

429
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:27,917
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

430
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,417
Think about it.

431
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,667
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

432
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,083
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

433
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,875
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

434
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,625
Put her in No.1

435
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,875
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

436
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,708
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,500
Look at this.

438
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,583
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

439
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,917
All the notorious ones together?

440
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,000
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

441
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,167
This one is Balu Kotian...

442
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,917
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

443
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,375
Go back.

444
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,458
Just a moment.

445
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,583
This...

446
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,667
Who's this?

447
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,667
I have never seen him before.

448
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,000
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

449
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,708
He's surely a member of some gang.

450
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,917
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

451
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:29,833
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

452
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:33,667
Only an organized gang
can operate with such finesse.

453
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,833
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

454
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,250
ls this a new style
of interrogation?

455
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,625
Feed meat and extract information?

456
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,667
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

457
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,000
If everything was without a price...

458
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,417
...then would you
have become a gangster?

459
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,417
You are right.

460
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you know him?

461
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,292
Are you kidding me?

462
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,250
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

463
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,292
You idiot!

464
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,583
When I had come to arrest you...

465
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

466
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,333
And now you talk about stature?

467
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,667
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

468
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,042
Katyal.

469
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,000
He is Sunny Katyal.

470
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,083
He's not from Mumbai.

471
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,333
He started operating here
around three years ago.

472
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,417
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

473
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,208
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

474
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,417
Whenever a girl between
8 to 18 years disappears...

475
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,708
more often than
not he is involved.

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,083
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

477
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,750
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

478
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,708
Why is he not on our radar yet?

479
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:15,000
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

480
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,625
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

481
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,792
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

482
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,167
He is a very smart man.

483
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:24,875
Keeps everyone happy.

484
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,625
Has no enemies.

485
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,417
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

486
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,000
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

487
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:36,875
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

488
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,667
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

489
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,875
Thanks for the meat.

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,625
Katyal.

491
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,125
Sunny Katyal.

492
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,292
I want to know about
every message...

493
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,708
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

494
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,083
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

495
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,417
I want to know everything.

496
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:08,167
Got it?

497
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,042
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,000
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

499
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,417
I want it clear.

500
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,542
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

501
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,083
The crime branch people
have made my life hell.

502
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

503
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,500
How did they get to know about you?

504
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,333
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

505
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,292
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

506
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,375
What will you do now?

507
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,000
lam thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

508
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,250
Moron!

509
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,875
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

510
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,250
Then please tell
me what I should do.

511
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,250
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

512
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,875
Throw some money at him.

513
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,833
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

514
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:44,625
It's some woman.

515
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,417
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

516
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,417
Woman? Tell me her name.

517
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,750
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

518
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:54,750
Do one thing.

519
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,625
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

520
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:03,875
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

521
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,917
Where the hell am I sitting!

522
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,125
Just when some money
was on its way...

523
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,542
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

524
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:18,708
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

525
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,167
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

526
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,208
Yes.

527
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,667
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

528
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:30,250
Really?

529
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,500
What did he say?

530
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,792
He signed a 200,000 deal.

531
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:39,167
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

532
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,375
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

533
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,042
It's getting delayed.

534
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,000
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

535
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,167
It will take a week more.

536
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:52,000
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

537
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,875
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

538
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,500
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

539
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,667
Not done.

540
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,208
What was her name?

541
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:07,708
Shivani Roy.

542
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,000
Wow! She's hot.

543
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,792
Let it be, Vakil sir.

544
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,333
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

545
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,000
I'll talk to her.

546
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,208
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

547
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,125
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

548
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,292
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

549
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,333
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

550
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,708
Let's wait for a few more days.

551
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,000
lam sure he will
commit some mistake.

552
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,083
Come on. I have got dinner.

553
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,042
Hello?

554
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,792
You reached home, Ma'am?

555
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,792
Who's this?

556
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,792
Doesn't matter.

557
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,500
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

558
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,250
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

559
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,542
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

560
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,500
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

561
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,500
Aunty, what have you got?

562
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,125
Someone else would
have been rattled.

563
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,792
Set the plates.
lam very hungry. Call Kaku.

564
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,333
Go, quick, quick.

565
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,125
Tell me.

566
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:23,750
Why are you watching me?

567
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,000
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

568
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:31,375
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

569
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,000
You sound like his son though.

570
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,417
How does it matter?

571
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,833
It's the same family.

572
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,667
The whole family seems twisted.

573
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,000
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

574
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,458
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

575
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,583
...one needs to be prepared, right?

576
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,708
No point tracing the IP address...

577
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,708
You won't find anything.

578
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,333
Enough bragging-

579
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,167
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

580
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,542
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

581
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,333
I want my daughter back.

582
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,708
Daughter?

583
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,125
You have a daughter?

584
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,875
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

585
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,125
...is like my daughter.

586
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,583
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

587
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,958
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

588
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,083
It's difficult now.

589
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,583
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

590
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:32,125
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

591
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,417
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

592
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,875
Let's do one thing.

593
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,917
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

594
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,792
The top floor is yours.

595
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:51,583
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

596
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,000
Then tell me what you want.

597
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,083
I told you I want Pyaari back.

598
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,292
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

599
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,167
That girl has seen too much.

600
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,208
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

601
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,708
It's too late now.

602
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,667
Aunty, hurry up!

603
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,417
Listen, kid.

604
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,083
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

605
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,000
But rescue I will.

606
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:23,792
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

607
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,083
Chill. Don't get worked up.

608
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:27,500
It doesn't suit you.

609
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,375
Anything else?

610
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,417
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

611
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,292
You need to think about it Junior.

612
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,875
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

613
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,000
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

614
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:48,542
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

615
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,083
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

616
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,250
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

617
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,292
Bye Ma'am.

618
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:04,500
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

619
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,667
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

620
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,042
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

621
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,042
How dare you touch me?

622
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:17,042
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

623
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,708
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

624
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,417
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

625
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,458
...and feed you to the dogs.

626
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,792
Sure.

627
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,500
<i>- Jaiar‘?
- P at“?</i>

628
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:37,000
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

629
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,667
Jalebi?

630
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:44,625
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

631
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:46,833
I don't eat jalebis.

632
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,292
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

633
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,000
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

634
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,583
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

635
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:56,375
Eat.

636
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:09,125
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

637
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:16,542
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

638
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,000
She looks grown
but is just a child.

639
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:26,375
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

640
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:38,750
No!

641
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,417
I thought I'll celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

642
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,833
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

643
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,750
How are you?

644
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

645
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,167
- Twelve.
- Me too.

646
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,042
You too?

647
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,750
Pyaari, come quickly.

648
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,167
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

649
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,417
What will you become
when you grow up?

650
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,750
An airplane driver.

651
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,667
What?

652
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,625
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

653
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,000
Same thing.

654
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:21,167
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

655
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,000
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

656
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,375
Thank you, Jafar.

657
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,167
He's a seasoned player.

658
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,583
We stuffed him with
a kilo ofjalebis...

659
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,500
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

660
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,792
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

661
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,333
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

662
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,167
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

663
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,167
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

664
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,250
Yes, Ma'am.

665
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,667
Thank you.

666
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,458
lam coming. Two minutes.

667
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,458
Aunty, you are so late!

668
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,833
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

669
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,167
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

670
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,833
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

671
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,083
Here...

672
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,125
...cupcake.

673
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,917
For both of you.

674
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,583
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

675
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,292
Have it.

676
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,167
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

677
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,542
That's the only way to survive here.

678
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,875
Otherwise your life will be hell.

679
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,708
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

680
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:34,583
Come on.

681
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:44,500
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

682
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,458
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

683
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,208
This guy will do our job for free.

684
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,458
Here.

685
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,750
Call Riyaz.

686
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,500
Tell him that this job must be done.

687
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,500
Performance bonus guaranteed.

688
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:10,958
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

689
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,875
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

690
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,000
It's good that way.

691
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,083
Fear gets work done faster.

692
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,292
Morey... 21 missed calls!

693
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,458
Ma'am, come quickly.

694
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:48,417
Why?

695
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,000
Ma'am, come quickly please.

696
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:01,542
Get the pervert doctor!

697
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,167
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

698
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,292
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

699
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,083
...of inappropriate behaviour.

700
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,292
Runa, that's my Kaku!

701
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,875
What's going on?

702
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,750
A few hours after the allegations...

703
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:42,000
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

704
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:47,083
...attacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

705
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,750
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

706
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:54,167
But the people are
fuming with anger...

707
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,292
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

708
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,917
The anger found its vent this way.

709
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,125
That doctor must be punished.

710
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:05,583
Please eat.

711
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,375
Hello?

712
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,708
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

713
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,833
lam genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

714
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:59,458
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

715
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,583
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

716
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:06,083
Because I am just
starting to like you.

717
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,458
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

718
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,458
It's just business.

719
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

720
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,250
Please.

721
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,625
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

722
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:26,500
There was a dense
forest near my house.

723
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,667
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

724
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:36,208
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

725
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,417
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

726
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,708
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

727
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,250
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

728
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,458
You know what you are?

729
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,792
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

730
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:58,000
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

731
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,375
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

732
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,625
What are you doing
in the police force?

733
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,375
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

734
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,208
I don't know what your name is.

735
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,875
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

736
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,458
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

737
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,792
But I've figured your type

738
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:28,375
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

739
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:31,083
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

740
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,000
30 days.

741
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,750
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

742
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,833
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

743
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,917
Mark my words. 30 days.

744
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:05,000
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

745
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,000
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

746
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,083
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

747
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,458
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

748
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,000
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

749
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,833
Now you are making me drool.

750
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,292
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

751
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,708
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

752
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:25,833
That's awesome, Sir.

753
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,667
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

754
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,417
Why should I get you the contract?

755
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:34,708
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

756
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:39,583
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

757
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,833
Film star or porn star.

758
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,667
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

759
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,125
Why should I get you the contract?

760
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,208
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

761
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,000
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

762
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:58,875
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

763
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,458
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

764
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,417
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

765
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,292
Darling, baby, come here.

766
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,375
Don't be shy. Come here.

767
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,083
Good girl.

768
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:22,167
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

769
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,958
Call me on Monday.

770
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,208
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

771
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,958
Don't forget, Sir!

772
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,583
Come, baby...

773
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:43,917
Hey, Mattu.

774
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:47,500
You really do appear out of nowhere!

775
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,958
I have been watching you.

776
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,708
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

777
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,250
I am not selling water purifiers.

778
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,625
I am trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

779
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,542
If he doesn't call on Monday...

780
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,792
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

781
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,375
If this deal doesn't come through...

782
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,125
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

783
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,750
I am at it.

784
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,083
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

785
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,958
Okay. You crack this deal.

786
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,167
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

787
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,292
Mumbai?

788
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,708
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

789
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,333
Left... left... Very good.

790
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:19,542
Good Job.

791
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,792
You fool! Be careful.

792
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,583
The packet will break.

793
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,125
Be careful.

794
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,458
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

795
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,125
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

796
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,750
Hello, Vakil Sir.

797
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,208
This time the consignment is superb!

798
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,208
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

799
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:43,708
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

800
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,875
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

801
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:48,292
Should I fix her?

802
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,000
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

803
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,292
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

804
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,375
What should I do then?

805
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,167
Go underground for a few days.

806
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,042
One of my men will
come in the evening.

807
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,625
Go with him to the safe house.

808
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,167
He will make arrangements
for you there.

809
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,125
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

810
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,708
Don't crib so much!

811
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,958
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

812
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:10,708
Go with my man.

813
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:12,833
Bye.

814
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:16,417
Pour it in my mouth!

815
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,083
Get lost!

816
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,167
lam surrounded by duck heads!

817
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,167
What's going on?

818
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:32,125
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

819
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:35,250
Good bye, Sir!

820
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,500
Hello? Hello?

821
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,917
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

822
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,042
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

823
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,833
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

824
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,750
Hello?

825
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,167
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

826
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,208
Everything is bloody jinxed!

827
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,625
Get out of the car.

828
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,000
Get out.

829
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,250
Vakil Sir!

830
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,292
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

831
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,375
I am getting out!

832
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,167
Listen to me.

833
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,208
Why are you doing this? For money?

834
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:25,625
I'll give you double.

835
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:26,750
Move!

836
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,417
Listen to me once.

837
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,375
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

838
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,375
Your life will be made.

839
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,792
What's happening with me!

840
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,375
Isn't there a chance?

841
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:44,250
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

842
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,542
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

843
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,958
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

844
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:53,708
It screws you.

845
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,583
Look at me.

846
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:56,875
Fifteen years...

847
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,833
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

848
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,042
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

849
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,625
What a business you guys run!

850
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:22,583
May I ask you something?

851
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,875
How did you know about this?

852
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,958
lam beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

853
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,833
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

854
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:42,500
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

855
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,333
When you sat in the car,

856
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:47,208
Morey recognized that
your driver was Hanif‘s man.

857
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:50,458
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

858
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,958
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

859
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:54,667
True.

860
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:57,875
I won't leave that rascal.

861
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,458
Nor will I.

862
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,458
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

863
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,042
Kid? Which kid?

864
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,417
Your boss.

865
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,417
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

866
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,792
What are you saying, Ma'am.

867
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,792
Vakil is at least
50 - 55 years old.

868
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,542
He is not a kid.

869
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:15,875
You scum!

870
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,125
If you waste our time again...

871
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,958
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

872
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,833
I swear by God I am not lying.

873
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,250
If I am lying...

874
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,458
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

875
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,625
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

876
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,917
lam working with him since then.

877
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:33,667
Keep talking.

878
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,125
I know Vakil very well.

879
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,500
He stays in Delhi.

880
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:37,208
Hello?

881
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,833
Damn! Katyal escaped.

882
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:40,875
How?

883
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:42,875
Hanif's man was found dead.

884
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:44,833
How did he die?

885
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,125
He was shot.

886
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,042
Where?

887
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,833
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

888
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:52,917
On the body.

889
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,042
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

890
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,250
He was shot in the head from behind.

891
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,792
Where did they find the dead body?

892
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,208
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

893
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,417
Hang up the other phone.

894
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,292
Hung UP-

895
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,375
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

896
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:16,917
But who saved him?

897
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,167
Who else?

898
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,417
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

899
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,917
It's time to send her another gift.

900
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:09,667
Congrats Ma'am.

901
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,958
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

902
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,208
Every time you point
a finger at me...

903
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,375
...you will get this gift from me.

904
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,042
Your Kid.

905
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:45,542
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

906
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:07,708
Hello!

907
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,417
I have left from the hotel.
I am going to office now.

908
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,375
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

909
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:24,417
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

910
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,167
He was my senior in the institute.

911
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:28,125
We used to have
fun times those days.

912
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,292
He praises you very highly.

913
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,750
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like a wild bull.

914
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,458
You know what.
Good officers like you...

915
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,292
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

916
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,958
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

917
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,583
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

918
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,917
A very efficient officer.

919
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,167
Shivani Roy.

920
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,625
- Ma'am... - Senior Inspector,
Mumbai Crime Branch.

921
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,583
She has come with information
on a huge child...

922
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,917
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

923
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,000
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

924
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:01,917
Thank you, Sir.

925
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,458
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

926
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,292
Your source? Here?

927
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:09,250
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

928
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,958
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

929
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,458
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

930
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,625
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

931
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,458
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

932
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
But nobody knows his real name.

933
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:23,875
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

934
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,083
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

935
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,500
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

936
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:33,417
We haven't heard of him ever.

937
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,500
He takes pride in that.

938
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,667
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

939
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,625
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

940
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,208
Of course there is.

941
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,833
One is drugs and the other is girls.

942
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,333
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

943
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,125
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

944
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,750
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

945
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:55,042
We'll have to play him
in such a way...

946
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,708
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

947
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:02,833
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

948
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,208
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

949
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,583
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

950
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,833
He is that greedy.

951
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,750
As far as I know, Sodhi...

952
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,417
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

953
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,625
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

954
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,875
That means a higher profit margin.

955
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,583
He will do anything for business.

956
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,292
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

957
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:32,167
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

958
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:35,208
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

959
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:38,708
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

960
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,417
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

961
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,250
Why should we do it?

962
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,417
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

963
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,542
But it's a matter of our life too.

964
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:58,958
And what if we get killed?

965
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,542
Who will kill you?

966
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,583
We are here to protect you. Relax.

967
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,542
Stupid policeman.

968
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,208
No.

969
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,542
Listen to me Mboso.

970
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,375
Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

971
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,375
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

972
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,375
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

973
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,292
You decide.

974
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,417
- Where's Bob?
- What?

975
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,333
- Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

976
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:41,083
Okay.

977
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:46,917
Hail Almighty!

978
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:50,000
Mindblowing stuff!

979
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,167
Very good, very good.

980
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,083
' Hey, Bob!
- Baby!

981
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:57,083
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

982
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,125
Go H110!!!

983
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,083
So, big guy, how much do you have?

984
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:04,375
Five.

985
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,917
Five what?

986
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:07,292
Five kilos.

987
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,125
Are you crazy?

988
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:13,000
I want 100 grams only.

989
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:17,833
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

990
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:18,917
Let's go.

991
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,833
Listen, come here.

992
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:29,292
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

993
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,458
The whole material. Okay?

994
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,375
How much longer? Please hurry.

995
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,750
What should I tell Bob?

996
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,000
Who's Bob?

997
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,958
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

998
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,375
He met those Nigerians.

999
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,000
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1000
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,250
Give me some onions.

1001
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,167
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1002
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,042
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1003
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:03,458
How much longer?

1004
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,083
It's been a long time now.

1005
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:14,375
Tell all our people that
if someone demands girls...

1006
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:18,917
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1007
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,583
Our cop chick will surely
send someone as a customer.

1008
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:24,875
Not to take any new customers?

1009
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,042
I said no.

1010
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,292
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1011
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,167
Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

1012
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,500
What else to say!

1013
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:39,667
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1014
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,167
Yeah, Bob.

1015
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:47,625
The call has come. I am leaving.

1016
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,167
Okay.

1017
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,375
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1018
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,458
Tell me the position
of Mboso's car later.

1019
01:04:58,042 --> 01:04:58,792
Let's go.

1020
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,292
- Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1021
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,458
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1022
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:21,375
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1023
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,375
Ma'am we are the police.

1024
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,208
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1025
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,625
Ma'am, let's go.

1026
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,000
Sit. Quick.

1027
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,042
lam leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1028
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,375
The cops are riding autos
these days.

1029
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:33,750
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1030
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,208
- Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1031
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:54,792
We have got a biker
who's asking us to follow.

1032
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:55,833
Follow him.

1033
01:05:56,542 --> 01:06:00,542
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1034
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,000
Sodhi, stop.

1035
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,708
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1036
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,500
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1037
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,583
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1038
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,917
Track the car on
GPS and let me know.

1039
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:09,417
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1040
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,083
Go.

1041
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,792
Yes, Mathur.

1042
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,875
Sodhi, take a left.

1043
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,250
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1044
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,958
All okay. You can come up.

1045
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:34,708
Okay.

1046
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:41,625
Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1047
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,292
The cops are here.

1048
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:17,833
Get out from the back door.

1049
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:21,542
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1050
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:22,750
Cover from there.

1051
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1052
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,583
Ratan, they'll come
up if they hear a gun shot.

1053
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,083
You leave from the back door.

1054
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,708
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1055
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,292
You've deceived Vakil!

1056
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,083
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1057
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,958
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1058
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,042
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1059
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,542
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1060
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,250
Okay.

1061
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,500
Break it.

1062
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,208
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1063
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:42,500
Come, you...

1064
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,000
You conned us!

1065
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,042
In the Nehru Place office...

1066
01:09:56,125 --> 01:10:00,375
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1067
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,375
It has the numbers and
addresses of our clients.

1068
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,583
Keep that carefully.

1069
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,417
I don't have time.

1070
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,542
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1071
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,292
And I won't ever let that happen.

1072
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,625
What are you talking about,
Vakil Sir?

1073
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,458
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1074
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,500
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1075
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,500
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1076
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,417
Vakil Sir?

1077
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:54,375
Move, move. Sodhi.

1078
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:21,792
Damn!

1079
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,167
You piece of trash!

1080
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:33,792
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1081
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:35,917
Did you sleep well?

1082
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,625
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1083
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,167
What to do Ma'am!

1084
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,458
I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

1085
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,917
So have you decided
how you'll kill me?

1086
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:52,542
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1087
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,417
lam just going to
lie back and watch you.

1088
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,833
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1089
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:02,958
Are you done wishing good morning...

1090
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,417
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1091
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,167
What is there to say?

1092
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,000
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1093
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,208
You are sharp I must admit.

1094
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,167
You killed Vakil Sir...

1095
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:21,792
...hid your family safely.

1096
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:25,500
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1097
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:27,875
Because I am still alive.

1098
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,958
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1099
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,458
But you are in my territory.

1100
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,542
Beware.

1101
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,042
Don't chew. Swallow!

1102
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,208
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1103
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,083
You just have to eat this pellet.

1104
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,000
Even the grapes are here.

1105
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,958
Will you practice with grapes?

1106
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,292
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1107
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,167
You better!

1108
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:05,208
Open your mouth.

1109
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:06,875
Give me some other work.

1110
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,042
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1111
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,417
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1112
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:16,167
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1113
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:18,417
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1114
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,083
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1115
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:21,375
Yes, they are.

1116
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:22,708
You worry too much.

1117
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,208
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1118
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,750
I'll take care of our set up there.

1119
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,458
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1120
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:31,792
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1121
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,667
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1122
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,875
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1123
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,875
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1124
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:39,958
Remember?

1125
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,917
ls anyone else
going to die this time?

1126
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,083
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1127
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,792
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1128
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,792
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1129
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,542
The pellets won't burst.

1130
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,042
Chill. Everything is under control.

1131
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:51,875
Yes.

1132
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,625
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1133
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,167
We must have only
the best in the party.

1134
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,417
- Alka.
- Yes.

1135
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,375
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1136
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,042
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1137
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,667
She will definitely go there.

1138
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,042
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1139
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:10,292
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1140
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,542
Angelina, baby...

1141
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,167
...what's wrong with you?

1142
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,917
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1143
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:21,167
She hasn't slept well last night.

1144
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,708
ls your name Julia or Angelina?

1145
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:25,833
Julia...

1146
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:28,292
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1147
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,458
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1148
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,625
lam just tired...

1149
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:38,708
Tired, huh?

1150
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,375
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1151
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:44,833
I understand.

1152
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:47,458
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1153
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,458
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1154
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:51,500
No, no, no...

1155
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,875
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1156
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:57,375
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1157
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:02,542
Please let her stay. Please.

1158
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,667
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1159
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,958
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1160
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:17,750
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,667
- Hurry.
- Yes.

1162
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,167
Runa...

1163
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,792
Runa...

1164
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,375
Get her quickly!

1165
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,792
Runa... No! Runa!

1166
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,000
Take her away. Come on!

1167
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:38,167
Runa!

1168
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,375
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1169
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:55,083
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1170
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:58,042
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1171
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,458
But we didn't, Sir!

1172
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,958
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1173
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:05,125
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1174
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:08,458
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1175
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,125
And not just drugs...

1176
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,833
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1177
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:15,750
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1178
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:19,167
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1179
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,583
Department?

1180
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,833
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1181
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,000
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1182
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,750
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1183
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:33,000
You need intent.

1184
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,250
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1185
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,875
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1186
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:45,583
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1187
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,667
No name, no ties.

1188
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:52,750
It's very easy to give up on them.

1189
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,958
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1190
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:58,875
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1191
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:03,167
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everything's over?

1192
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:07,125
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1193
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:10,708
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1194
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,417
But that doesn't mean that...

1195
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:16,208
...l forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1196
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,375
And that too after
being a police officer.

1197
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:20,750
You know what, Sir...

1198
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,917
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1199
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,583
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1200
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,500
Enough, Shivani!

1201
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,958
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1202
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,458
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1203
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:37,417
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1204
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:38,708
ls that clear?

1205
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,042
Sir, why us all the time?

1206
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:42,542
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1207
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,458
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1208
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,375
Thank you, Sir.

1209
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,167
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1210
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:31,750
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1211
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,583
Past four or five years.

1212
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,375
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1213
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,750
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1214
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,417
She escaped!

1215
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,292
Hello?

1216
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,625
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1217
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,417
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1218
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,792
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1219
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:46,417
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1220
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,708
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1221
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:51,958
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1222
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:52,708
Correct!

1223
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:54,208
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1224
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,208
Nobody came to claim his body.

1225
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:57,917
Because of fear of interrogation.

1226
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,958
Tell me what's your point.

1227
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:02,875
Vakil must surely have someone.

1228
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:04,375
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1229
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,750
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1230
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,292
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1231
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,125
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1232
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:16,667
...gun, pant, shirt,
wallet, anything.

1233
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:17,625
Get everything.

1234
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,583
We'll definitely find a clue.

1235
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,500
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1236
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,083
How can get it out of office?

1237
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:26,792
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1238
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:29,250
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1239
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:33,083
I was so worried getting
these things out of office.

1240
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,750
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1241
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:38,917
Always by the book.

1242
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:43,375
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1243
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,375
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1244
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,083
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1245
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:52,250
Please, Ma'am.

1246
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,625
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1247
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,458
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1248
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,167
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1249
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,042
That's surprising.

1250
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:14,042
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1251
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,542
Classic old school.

1252
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,083
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1253
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,458
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1254
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,292
Where is Modern Tailors?

1255
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,875
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,542
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1257
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,250
- From here?
- Yes.

1258
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:31,042
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1259
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,750
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1260
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,958
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1261
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,208
I know him for the past 23 years.

1262
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,875
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1263
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,917
I don't know that.

1264
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:53,292
My job is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1265
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:57,750
I don't know of any relatives.

1266
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,083
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1267
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:02,667
...for the past many years.

1268
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:08,917
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1269
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,375
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1270
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,833
Then she should
know about his death.

1271
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:17,958
Where does she stay?

1272
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:21,792
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1273
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,375
Yes?

1274
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:26,667
ls Minu Rastogi here?

1275
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:27,792
Who are you?

1276
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,542
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1277
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:31,750
Please come in.

1278
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,208
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1279
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,208
Harish...

1280
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:38,167
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1281
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:45,792
Get this medicine.

1282
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:48,250
Yes, Ma'am.

1283
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:49,917
Please sit.

1284
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,417
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1285
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,500
I have diabetes.

1286
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,833
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1287
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,000
You are young.

1288
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:05,833
- Here...
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,917
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1290
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,542
It's a long story.

1291
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,792
I have a lot of time.

1292
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,583
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,917
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1294
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,917
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1295
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:27,667
Yes.

1296
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:30,375
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1297
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,000
Go do your work.

1298
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,292
Actually...

1299
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,917
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1300
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:48,292
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1301
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,708
No, no, I have come alone.

1302
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:58,958
O God, strange are your ways!

1303
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:03,708
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1304
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,958
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1305
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:16,167
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1306
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:20,292
What do you call him?

1307
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,375
The kid.

1308
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:27,583
This is his house.

1309
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,208
What's happening to you?

1310
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:32,833
Feeling dizzy?

1311
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,542
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1312
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,792
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1313
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:49,458
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1314
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:54,250
You killed Vakil, right!

1315
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,375
My Karan will torture you to death.

1316
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:03,833
What fun it'll be!

1317
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:19,000
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1318
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:25,375
Hey...

1319
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,167
lam Walt.

1320
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,292
Actually my name is Karan.

1321
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:37,417
But I have changed it to Walt.

1322
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:42,750
It's the name of the
hero in an English show.

1323
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,083
So you did keep your promise.

1324
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:49,167
You found me on the 27th day.

1325
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,958
That's amazing.

1326
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,833
Congratulations!

1327
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,500
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1328
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,125
I'll just bring you to a state...

1329
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:05,542
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1330
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:09,167
<i>You!</i>

1331
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,208
Mom, what's for lunch?

1332
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,167
Are all the girls ready?

1333
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:40,292
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1334
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:41,958
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1335
01:27:42,042 --> 01:27:43,792
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1336
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:48,833
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1337
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:53,167
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1338
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:55,375
Honey, please. Thank you.

1339
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,292

Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1347
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,417
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1348
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:21,125
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1352
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,417
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1353
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,875
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1354
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,375
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1355
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,583
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1356
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:37,917
She's very strong.

1357
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,458
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1358
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,167
Who is she?

1359
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:44,833
I don't know.

1360
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,167
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1361
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:51,667
ls everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1362
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,292
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1363
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,042
Should I take them downstairs?

1364
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,125
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1365
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,375
Everybody please wait and watch.

1366
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,167
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1367
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,042
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1368
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,583
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1369
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:05,750
Get out.

1370
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,625
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1371
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:11,000
She's not asking you.

1372
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,542
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1373
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:16,375
Go.

1374
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,167
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1375
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:18,875
Go!

1376
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,500
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1377
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:25,625
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1378
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:31,292
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1379
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,625
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1380
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,083
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

1381
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:39,167
Get lost!

1382
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:40,708
Listen girl!

1383
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,750
I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

1384
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,417
I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1385
01:29:48,042 --> 01:29:49,167
Just untie my hands and see...

1386
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:53,458
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1387
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:56,083
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1388
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,417
Don't hit the face.

Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

You first show me your arrangements.

- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1422
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:50,500
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1423
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:51,875
He'll come later.

Come, Sir.

1425
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,542
Security is very tight.

1426
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:56,667
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1427
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,417
Only when there's no fear
of being photographed...

1428
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,083
...can a person enjoy freely.

Come, come, for Sir.

Don't be shy. Sir...

1432
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,875
Girls get abducted
in our cities for free...

01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:23,500
In broad day light.

1434
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:29,875
But when one guy sets up
a small organized business...

1435
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:31,542
...and everyone gets upset!

1436
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,625
Why did you do all of this?

1437
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:37,708
What did you get?

1438
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,250
You women get personal too soon.

1439
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:49,833
I agree that you are a cop,
from the crime branch.

1440
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,375
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1441
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,417
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1442
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:56,792
Where did you learn this?

1443
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,833
Nonsense.

1444
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:07,292
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1445
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,375
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1446
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,125
The night is young.

1447
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,125
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1448
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,000
Scream?

1449
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:26,375
Scream.

1450
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:38,167
That's right.

1451
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:41,042
There's no point.

1452
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,292
Crime branch!

1453
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,000
Sir has come.

1454
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,583
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1455
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,958
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1456
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,208
- How are you?
- All good.

1457
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:12,042
Everything's ready for you.

1458
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,625
Welcome, Sir!

1459
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,042
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1460
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,542
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1461
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:20,792
Wait here.

1462
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:26,750
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,083
Come, Sir.

1464
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:31,542
Tandon, have you checked
everything personally?

1465
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:32,500
Yes, Sir.

1466
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,875
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1467
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:38,417
Come, Sir.

1468
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,167
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1469
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,458
Sir, to your left.

1470
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,583
The arrangements look great.

1471
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,042
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1472
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,750
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1473
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,667
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1474
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,208
Everybody knows.

1475
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,708
Be it the opposition or women...

1476
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,417
...l am always in a mood to crush!

1477
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:13,042
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1478
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:23,583
Hello!

1479
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:27,250
I have heard a lot about you.

1480
01:35:29,917 --> 01:35:30,500
You?

1481
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:33,750
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1482
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:37,500
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1483
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:39,583
lam sure even you do.

1484
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,500
My hobby is this.

1485
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:44,750
Have you really come to rape me?

1486
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:47,708
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1487
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:51,417
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1488
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:11,250
You want to rape me!

1489
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:15,542
Get up! Come on!

1490
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:20,875
Stop this party!

1491
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:22,458
Get out!

1492
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:23,708
What is happening?

1493
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:25,750
Walt, where the hell are you?

1494
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,083
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1495
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,708
Where did she come from!

1496
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:30,167
She has lost it!

1497
01:36:32,792 --> 01:36:36,375
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1498
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,625
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1499
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:39,417
Mattu, wait!

1500
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:41,958
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1501
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:44,667
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1502
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:46,833
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1503
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:49,792
I want all the girls out.

1504
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:52,250
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1505
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,292
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1506
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,375
Mattu, are you dead!

1507
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,167
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1508
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:58,000
Hurry UP!

1509
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,042
Fast

1510
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:00,625
Fast, girls! Fast!

1511
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,875
Hurry up, Alka.

1512
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:03,917
- Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1513
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,625
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1514
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,750
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1515
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,125
Give her the damn key.

1516
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,417
You got the girls.

1517
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,583
What else do you want?

1518
01:37:16,083 --> 01:37:16,708
You.

1519
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:18,208
You will come with me.

1520
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,750
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1521
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:25,583
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1522
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:28,417
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1523
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:33,417
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1524
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:35,625
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1525
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:36,375
You wait.

1526
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,875
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1527
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,292
lam going to sort
it out and be right back.

1528
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:42,167
Raise your hands! Move!

1529
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:43,917
Move!

1530
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:45,917
Come on.

1531
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,250
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1532
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,083
Damn! She has locked the door!

1533
01:37:57,042 --> 01:37:57,750
Come on quickly.

1534
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,667
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1535
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,917
We are not going out.

1536
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,167
Open <i>m.</i>

1537
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:08,500
Open! Get in.

1538
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:11,500
Come on, girls. Get in.

1539
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:14,583
Be there.

1540
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:18,042
Pyaari, close the door.

1541
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:21,750
Lock the door. Lock it!

1542
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:34,208
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1543
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:35,417
Get in!

1544
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:40,708
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1545
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:44,167
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1546
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,208
But how did you manage to do this?

1547
01:38:48,292 --> 01:38:51,125
When I got the address
to your place...

1548
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,667
...l had no clue
that it is your house.

1549
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,667
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1550
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:00,375
In crime branch we are trained to...

1551
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:04,750
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1552
01:39:05,167 --> 01:39:08,542
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1553
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:11,708
Who else stays with her?

1554
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:13,917
Her son and a servant.

1555
01:39:14,542 --> 01:39:15,500
How old is the son?

1556
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,125
Around 25-26.

1557
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:21,167
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1558
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,167
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1559
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:29,792
I had heard this Azaan before.

1560
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,125
But where?

1561
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,167
Then I remembered.

1562
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:35,583
But you can't do any harm to me.

1563
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:37,167
Because I am still alive.

1564
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,958
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1565
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:45,667
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1566
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,042
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1567
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:52,250
I began watching your house.

1568
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,167
I spotted you the next day.

1569
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:56,042
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1570
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,292
But one look at your sly face...

1571
01:40:00,792 --> 01:40:01,750
...and I knew it had to be you.

1572
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:05,417
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1573
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:10,125
48 hours went by...

1574
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,208
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1575
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,250
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1576
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:21,125
...and also the other girls.

1577
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:25,208
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1578
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:28,792
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1579
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:30,792
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1580
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:35,000
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1581
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:37,542
I just had to make the move
at the right time.

1582
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,083
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1583
01:40:46,417 --> 01:40:49,583
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1584
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:52,833
Pyaari, get the phone.

1585
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,875
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1586
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,500
I had to take that risk.

1587
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,917
Like I said,
I knew your type.

1588
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:06,542
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1589
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,708
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1590
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:13,917
I must give it to you. But what now?

1591
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,000
Sodhi, come.

1592
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:21,250
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1593
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,542
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1594
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:28,833
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1595
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:32,125
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1596
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:36,875
Women... women...

1597
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:40,750
Take everything personally, right?

1598
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:42,417
Come on.

1599
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:48,042
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1600
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:49,833
As you wish.

1601
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:12,583
<i>Aunty!</i>

1602
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:24,083
Get up! Get up!

1603
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:04,167
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1604
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:12,375
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1605
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:17,208
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1606
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:20,417
This is India.

1607
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:25,875
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1608
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:29,375
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1609
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:32,875
This is trivial in comparison.

1610
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,792
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1611
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:39,000
Hit me, Ma'am.

1612
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:41,542
There is nothing else you can do.

1613
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,292
This is India.

1614
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:51,667
This one thing you are right about.

1615
01:43:52,583 --> 01:43:53,542
This is India.

1616
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:55,458
'This' is what goes on here.

1617
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:04,208
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1618
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:08,750
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1619
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:13,542
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1620
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:17,000
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1621
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,250
...issues can be settled this way.

1622
01:44:22,792 --> 01:44:23,542
Get up!

1623
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,750
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1624
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,208
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1625
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:36,792
Get up!

1626
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,458
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1627
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:52,708
What's your plan?

1628
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:56,792
Are you going to murder me?

1629
01:44:58,792 --> 01:45:00,417
In front of everyone?

1630
01:45:03,458 --> 01:45:04,625
This is India.

1631
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:07,875
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1632
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:10,792
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1633
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,958
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1634
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:31,125
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1635
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:36,458
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1636
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:51,292
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1637
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:56,542
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1638
01:45:56,792 --> 01:46:01,292
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1639
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,958
But if you ever mess with me

1640
01:46:04,042 --> 01:46:06,583
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1641
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:11,875
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1642
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:31,958
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1643
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:36,833
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1644
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:41,500
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1645
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,333
But if you ever mess with me

1646
01:46:44,417 --> 01:46:47,042
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1647
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,250
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1648
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:12,375
In a skirt or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1649
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:17,542
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1650
01:47:22,708 --> 01:47:27,542
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1651
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:32,542
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1652
01:47:32,792 --> 01:47:37,375
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1653
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:39,917
But if you ever mess with me

1654
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:42,833
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1655
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:52,208
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1656
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:56,167
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1657
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:59,917
He revealed everything about Walt,

1658
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,417
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1659
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:06,750
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1660
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:08,417
And then God did.

1661
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:10,750
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1662
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,042
Taneja survived
and is now in Tiharjail.

1663
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,958
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1664
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,167
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1665
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:34,917
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1666
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:38,292
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scot-free...

1667
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:39,792
must be stopped.

1668
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,125
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1669
01:48:42,292 --> 01:48:45,042
has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1670
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,417
The war is still on.
