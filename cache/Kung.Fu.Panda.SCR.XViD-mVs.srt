1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>Legend tells of a legendary warrior,...</i>

2
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.</i>

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,600
<i>He travelled the land
in search of worthy foes.</i>

4
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,000
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should on my fist!

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,400
<i>The warrior said nothing
for his mouth was full.</i>

6
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,100
<i>Then he swallowed.
And then he spoke.</i>

7
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,300
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>He was so deadly in fact,
that his enemies will go blind,...</i>

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>...from over exposure to pure
awesomeness.</i>

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,100
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
- And attractive.
- How can we re-pay you?

12
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,600
There is no charge for awesomeness.
Or attractiveness.

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
<i>It mattered not how many foes he faced.
They were no match for his bodacity.</i>

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>Never before had a panda
been so feared and so loved.</i>

15
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>Even the most heroic heroes
in all of China,...</i>

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,700
<i>...The Furious Five, bowed in respect
to this great master.</i>

17
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,600
We should hang out.

18
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,200
Agreed.

19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
<i>But hanging out
would have to wait.</i>

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,900
<i>Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain.</i>

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,300
<i>There is only one thing
that matters and that’s...</i>

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,900
- Po! Get up!
- You'll be late for work.

23
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
What?

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Po, get up!

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,500
Hey, Po.
What are you doing up there?

26
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,600
Ah, nothing.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,300
Monkey, Mantis, Crane,
Viper, Tigress!

28
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,900
Po, let's go.
You're late for work.

29
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Coming!

30
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Sorry dad.

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Sorry, doesn't make the noodles.

32
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,500
What were you doing up there?
All that noise?

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh, nothing.
Just had a crazy dream.

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
About what?
What were you dreaming about?

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
What was I...

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
...I was dreaming about a...

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Noodles.

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,700
Noodles?
You were really dreaming about noodles?

39
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, what else would I be
dreaming about?

40
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,800
Oh, careful.
That soup is... sharp!

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Oh, happy day. My son finally
having the noodle dream.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,500
You don't know how long
I have been waiting for this moment.

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,700
This is a sign, Po.

44
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,800
A sign of what?

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,900
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret ingredient,...

46
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,700
...of my secret ingredient soup.

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,600
And then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant.

48
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,200
Just as I took over from my father
who took over from his father...

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,700
...who won it from a friend
over a game of mahjong.

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Dad, dad, dad.
It was just a dream.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,200
No, it was "the dream".

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,500
We're noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,000
But dad, didn't you ever... I don't know,
wanted to do something else?

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Something beside noodles.

55
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,900
Actually, when I was
young and crazy.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I thought of running away
and learning how to make Toe Foo.

57
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,500
So why didn't you?

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh, because it was
a stupid dream.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,700
Can you imagine me making Toe Foo?

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Toe Foo.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,100
No, we all have our place
in this world.

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,100
- Mine is here and yours is...
- I know, is here.

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,500
No, it’s tables 2, 5, 7 and 12.

64
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
Service with a smile.

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,800
Well done, students...

66
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
...if you were trying
to disappoint me.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey greater speed.

68
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Crane, height.
Viper, subtlety. Mantis...

69
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,900
- Master Shifu...
- What?

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,700
It's... it's Master Oogway,
he wants to see you.

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

72
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,600
- So, nothing is wrong?
- Well, I didn't say that.

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,400
You were saying?

75
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,000
I have had a vision.

76
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Tai Lung will return.

77
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,000
That is impossible.
He's in prison.

78
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,900
Nothing is impossible.

79
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Zeng, fly to Chor Ghom Prison.
And tell them to double the guards,...

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,400
...double the weapons.
Double everything.

81
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,300
Tai Lung does not leave
that prison.

82
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes, Master Shifu.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,800
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,700
We have to do something. We can't
just have him march in the valley.

85
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
And take his revenge.
He'll, he'll...

86
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,800
Your mind is like this water
my friend. When it is agitated...

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
...it becomes difficult to see.

88
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,700
But if you allow it to settle,
the answer becomes clear.

89
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
The Dragon Scroll.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
- It is time.
- But who?

91
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,300
Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power...

92
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,300
...to become the Dragon Warrior?

93
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
I don't know.

94
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,300
Excuse me, excuse me.
Sorry.

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
- Oh, sorry.
- Hey, watch it Po.

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Sorry.

97
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Sorry, a thousand pardon.

98
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,800
What?

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Master Oogway is choosing
the Dragon Warrior, today.

100
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Everyone, everyone, go!
Get to the Jade Palace!

101
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,400
One of the five is going
to get the Dragon's Scroll.

102
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,500
We've been waiting a thousand
years for this. Just take the bowl!

103
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,200
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it. Just go!

104
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,800
Po! Where are you going?

105
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,700
To the Jade Palace.

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
But you're forgetting your noodle cart.

107
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,700
The whole valley will be there and
you will sell noodle to all of them.

108
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,400
Selling noodles?

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
But Dad. You know I was kind
of thinking, maybe I...

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,700
- Yeah?
- I was kind of thinking, maybe I...

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Could also sell the bean buns.
They're... They're about to go bad.

112
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,700
That's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.

113
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah...
I'm glad I had it.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,300
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me too!

115
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Almost there.

116
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,100
What? No!
Oh, no!

117
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,200
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

118
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
No, I'll bring you back a souvenir.

119
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,300
It's a historic day.
Isn't it Master Oogway?

120
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,200
Yes. The one I feared
I would not live to see.

121
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,600
- Are your students ready?
- Yes, Master Oogway.

122
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Now know this old friend...

123
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,400
...whomever I chose will not only bring
peace to the valley, but also to you.

124
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,500
Let the tournament begin!

125
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
No, no, no, wait!
I'm coming.

126
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,600
Hey! Open the door.

127
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Let me in!

128
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>Citizens of the Valley of Peace!</i>

129
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,600
<i>It is my great honour
to present to you,...</i>

130
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,600
<i>...Tigress, Viper, Crane,
Monkey, Mantis.</i>

131
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,200
The Furious Five!

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
They're The Furious Five!

133
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>Warriors prepare!</i>

134
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,400
- Where's... Hah! A peeky hole.
- Ready for battle.

135
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,300
The thousand tons of fire!

136
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,200
- Wow, look at that!
- Hey! Get out of the way!

137
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,500
<i>And finally, Master Tigress.</i>

138
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>Believe me citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.</i>

139
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
I know!

140
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,300
<i>Master Tigress faces Iron Arms
and it's "Blades of Death".</i>

141
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

142
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,600
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,...

143
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,600
...Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior.

144
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
Ha? But I...
No, no, no wait!

145
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,500
Yeah.

146
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Po! What are you doing?

147
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,300
What does it look like I'm doing?

148
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Stop! Stop! I'm going to see
the Dragon Warrior.

149
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,300
But I don't understand,
you finally have the noodle dream.

150
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,300
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, dad.

151
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,600
I love Kung Fu!

152
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,900
Oh, come on, son.
Let's get back to work.

153
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Okay.

154
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Po! Come back!

155
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh. What's going on?

156
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Where...?

157
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Why are you pointing...?

158
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted
to see who the Dragon Warrior was?

159
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,100
How interesting?

160
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,900
Master, are you pointing at me?

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
- Him.
- Who?

162
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
- You.
- Me?

163
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,000
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior.

164
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
- What?
- What?

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,300
- What?
- What?

166
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Stop wait.
Who told you to...

167
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,800
Master Oogway, wait.

168
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,000
That flabby panda can't possibly
be the answer to our problem.

169
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,900
You were about to appoint the Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her.

170
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,300
- That was just an accident.
- There are no accidents.

171
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,100
Forgive us, Master.
We have failed you.

172
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,100
No. If the panda has not quit by morning,
then I would have failed you.

173
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

174
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,900
I bring a message from Master Shifu.

175
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,800
What? Double the guard?
Extra precautions?

176
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,900
Your prison may not be adequate?

177
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,700
You doubt my prison security?

178
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
Absolutely not!

179
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,300
Shifu does.
I'm just the messenger.

180
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

181
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,000
Escape from Chor Ghom prison
is impossible.

182
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,800
Impressive, isn't it?

183
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,200
Yes, very impressive.
It's... It's very impressive.

184
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,000
One way in, one way out.

185
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.

186
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,600
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung.

187
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,100
Take us down.

188
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, my!

189
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,900
Behold Tai Lung.

190
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,600
I'll... Uhm...
I'll just wait right here.

191
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,400
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

192
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,600
- War posts! At the ready.
- War posts?

193
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, tough guy.
Did you hear?

194
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,600
Oogway is finally going to give
someone the Dragon Scroll...

195
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
...and it's not going to be you.

196
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
What are you doing?
Don't get him mad.

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,000
What is he going to do about it?
I've got him completely immobilised.

198
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,200
Oh, did I step on
the woolly kiddy's tail?

199
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm gonna... I've seen enough.

200
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm gonna tell Shifu,
he has nothing to worry about.

201
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
- No, he doesn't.
- Okay I'll tell him that.

202
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,100
Can we please go now?

203
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Oh. Wait a second.

204
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
I think there has been
a slight mistake.

205
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Everyone seems
to think I'm, err...

206
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,400
The sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way!

207
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Look at this place.

208
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Master Flying-Rhino's armour.
With authentic battle damage!

209
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Wow! The Sword of Heroes.

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Said to be so sharp, you can cut
yourself just by looking...

211
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,400
The invisible "Trident of Destiny".

212
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

213
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
No!

214
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
The legendary "Urn of
Whispering Warriors".

215
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Said to contain souls of the
entire Tenshu army.

216
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,800
- Hello?
- Have you finished sightseeing?

217
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,100
Sorry. I should have
come to see you first.

218
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
- My patience is running thin.
- Ohh?

219
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,000
Well. I mean, it's not like
you are going anywhere.

220
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,400
- You turn around.
- Sure.

221
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Hey, how is it going?
How do you get 500... Master Shifu!

222
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,000
Someone broke that.
But I'm going to fix it... I'll... I'll...

223
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,900
Do you have some glue?

224
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,900
I've a splinter.

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,800
So you are the legendary
Dragon Warrior?

226
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,100
- Ahh, I guess so?
- Wrong!

227
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,700
You are not the Dragon Warrior.
You will never be the Dragon Warrior...

228
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,400
...until you've learned the secret
of the Dragon scroll.

229
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,800
Wow. So... Uhm...
How does this work?

230
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Do you have a ladder?
A trampoline or...?

231
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,900
You think it is that easy?

232
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,300
That I'm just going to hand you
the secret to limitless power?

233
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
No! I...

234
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,300
One must first master the highest
level of Kung Fu...

235
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
...and that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

236
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
- Someone like me?
- Yes!

237
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Look at you!
This fat butt, flabby arms.

238
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,000
Those are sensitive
in the flabby parts.

239
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,700
And this ridiculous belly.

240
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,000
- And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
- Now wait a minute.

241
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
- That's a little uncalled for... - Don't stand
that close. I can smell your breath.

242
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,900
Listen, Oogway said that I was the...

243
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
Uh... the Wuxi Finger Hold.
No, Wuxi Finger Hold.

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,300
You know this hold?

245
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,300
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the 3rd dynasty. Yes.

246
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,100
Then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

247
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,700
No, no, no.

248
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,500
You know the hardest part of this?...
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.

249
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,700
Okay. Okay, take it easy.

250
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,100
Now listen closely, Panda.

251
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,300
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,...

252
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,700
...I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't.

253
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,400
Are we clear?

254
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,400
Yes, we're clear, we're clear.
We are so clear.

255
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Good. I can't wait to get started.

256
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,300
Let's begin.

257
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Wait, wait, wait.

258
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
What?

259
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,900
- Now?
- Yes, now.

260
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,900
Unless you think that the great Oogway was
wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

261
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,500
Okay. Well, I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

262
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,800
Well, if we don't try,
we will never know, will we?

263
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,700
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

264
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,000
- And what level is that?
- Well, you know...

265
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm not a master, but
let's just start at zero.

266
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,200
- Level zero.
- No, there is no such thing as level zero.

267
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,400
Hey, maybe I can start with that.

268
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,400
That? We use that for training children
and for popping the door open when it is hot.

269
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,000
But if you insist.

270
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
Wow! The Furious Five.

271
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,900
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

273
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Go ahead, Panda.
Show us what you can do.

274
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
Are they going to watch? Or should I just
wait until they get back to work or something?

275
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,100
- Hit it.
- Okay, I mean, I just ate...

276
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,300
...and so I'm still digesting, so my
Kung Fu may not be as good as later on.

277
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,900
Just hit it.

278
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Alright.

279
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,900
What'd you got?
You've got nothing cos' I got it right here.

280
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,200
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to fell the thunder.

281
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Come on, crazy feet.
What're you going to do about crazy feet?

282
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,800
Come on. I'm a blur. I'm a blur.
You've never seen Bear style.

283
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,600
You've only seen Praying Mantis.

284
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Or Monkey style.
Or imagine snake-kiddy Snake.

285
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,700
Would you hit it?

286
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Alright. Alright.

287
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,000
Why don't you try it again?
A little harder.

288
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,700
How's that?...

289
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Oh, that hurts!

290
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
This will be easier than I thought.

291
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,500
Feeling a little nausea.

292
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,800
My tenders.

293
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,200
How did I do?

294
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,800
There is now a level zero.

295
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,500
- There is no words.
- Don't denying that.

296
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't understand
what Master Oogway was thinking.

297
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,800
- Poor guy is going to get himself killed.
- He is so mighty.

298
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,900
The Dragon Warrior fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

299
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,300
When he walks,
the very ground shakes.

300
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,800
One would think that Master Oogway would
choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.

301
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,300
- Yeah or could at least touch his toes.
- Or even see his toes.

302
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,300
Okay.

303
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
Great.

304
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Oh, hey. Hi.
You're up?

305
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,600
- Am now.
- I was just... er... someday... huh?

306
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,000
The Kung Fu stuff is hard work, right?
Your biceps sore.

307
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,800
I've had a long day and rather
disappointing day, so... er...

308
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,400
Yeah... I should probably
get to sleep now.

309
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
- Okay. Thanks.

310
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,100
It's just, I'm...
I'm such a big fan...

311
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,200
You guys were so totally amazing
at the battle of the Weeping River.

312
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,200
Outnumbered a thousand to one.
But, you didn't stop. You just,...

313
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Oh. Sorry about that.

314
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Ahh... Look you don't belong here.

315
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,800
I know, I know.
You're right.

316
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,100
I don't have it.
It's just, my whole life, I dreamed of...

317
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,900
No, no, no. I meant you don't
belong here, I mean in this room.

318
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,300
But this is my room.
Property of Crane.

319
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,700
Oh, okay. Right, right.
So...

320
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,300
Yeah, you want to get to sleep.
I'm keeping you up.

321
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
We've got big things tomorrow.

322
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,400
Alright. You are awesome. The last thing
I'm going to say. Okay, bye-bye.

323
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,100
- What was that?
- I didn't say anything.

324
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay. Alright. Good night.
Sleep well.

325
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,200
Seem a little bit awkward.

326
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,800
Master Tigress, didn't mean
to wake you. Just a...

327
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,600
- You don't belong here.
- Ah, yeah. Yeah, of course.

328
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,200
- This is your room... - I mean you don't
belong in the Jade Palace.

329
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,500
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu and if
you have any respect of who we are...

330
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,200
...and what we do,
you will be gone by morning.

331
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Big fan.

332
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,500
I see you've found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

333
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,200
Is that what this is? I'm so sorry.
I thought it was just a regular peach tree.

334
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,400
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

335
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,500
Upset? I'm not upset. Why? Why?
What makes you think that I'm upset?

336
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,500
So, why are you upset?

337
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,800
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of Kung Fu.

338
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,000
In the history of China.

339
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
In the history of sucking.

340
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,700
Probably.

341
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,800
And the Five... Man, you should have
seen them, they totally hate me.

342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Totally.

343
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,400
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

344
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,300
I mean, I'm not like the Five.
I've got no claws.

345
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,500
No wings, no venom.
Even Mantis got those thingies.

346
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
May be I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

347
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,800
Quit. Don't quit.
Noodles. Don't noodles.

348
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,400
You are too concerned with
what was and what will be.

349
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,400
There's a saying.
Yesterday is history,

350
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Tomorrow is a mystery,
But today is a gift.

351
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,500
That is why it is called the "present".

352
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,200
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?

353
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,800
To your battle stations!
Go! Go! Go!

354
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,500
- Fire Cross-Bow!
- Fire!

355
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,800
Fire!

356
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Tai Lung's free. I must warn Shifu.

357
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,500
You are not going anywhere.
Neither is he!

358
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
- Let go of me.
- Bring it up!

359
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,200
- Wait!
- Bring it back!

360
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,900
- He's going this way.
- He won't get far.

361
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,200
Archers!

362
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,400
We're dead.
So very, very dead.

363
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,700
Not yet, we're not.
Now!

364
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

365
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,500
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

366
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,400
I was beginning to think
I've been forgotten.

367
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,200
Fly back there and tell them, the real
Dragon Warrior is coming home.

368
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,100
Good Morning, Master.

369
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,400
Panda!

370
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
Panda! Wake up!

371
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,500
He's quitted.

372
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,200
What do we do now Master
with the Panda gone?

373
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

374
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
All we can do is resume your
training and trust that in time...

375
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,100
...the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

376
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,100
What are you doing here?

377
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,800
Hey. Good morning, Master.

378
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,000
I thought I'll warm up a little.

379
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,700
- You're stuck.
- Stuck?...No...What?...Stuck?

380
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,500
No... This is one of the...
Yeah... I'm stuck.

381
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,500
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

382
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Lift me on three.
One, two,...

383
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

384
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,000
- No, really. I appreciate it...
- Ever.

385
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one night?

386
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,400
It takes years to develop
ones flexibility.

387
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,200
And years longer
to apply it in combat.

388
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,500
Put that down!

389
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,900
The only souvenirs we collect here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

390
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah! Excellent!

391
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
Let's get started.

392
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,700
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready...Oww!

393
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,100
I'm sorry brother.
I thought you said you're ready.

394
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,200
That was awesome!
Let's go again!

395
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,900
I've been taking it easy on you Panda
but no more. Your next opponent...

396
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,800
...will be me.
- Alright. Yeah, let's go!

397
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Step forth!

398
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,100
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness.

399
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
And make him suffer for it.

400
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,800
Oh yeah. To take his strength
and use it against him.

401
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,500
Until he finally falls or quits.

402
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,500
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry Master, I'll never quit.

403
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,200
If he is smart he won't
come back those steps.

404
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,100
- But he will.
- He's not going to quit, is he?

405
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,800
He's not going to quit bouncing.
I'll tell you that.

406
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,100
I thought you said accupuncture
will make me feel better.

407
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,600
Trust me it will. It's just not easy
finding right nerve points...

408
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
...under all this...
- Fat? - Fur!

409
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,300
- I was going to say fur.
- Sure you were.

410
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,700
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size?

411
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,900
I mean, look at me.
I'm over here.

412
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,400
Maybe you should take
a look at this again.

413
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,300
Okay.

414
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,200
Ouch!
Stop it! Stop it!

415
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all.

416
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,700
But if I didn't know any better
I'd say he's trying to get rid of me.

417
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,600
I know he can seem like heartless.

418
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,800
But you know he wasn't
always like that.

419
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:40,500
According to legend there was once a time
when Master Shifu actually used to smile.

420
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,000
- No... - Yes.
- But that was before...

421
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,200
- Before what?
- Before Tai Lung.

422
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,000
Aah... Yeah. We are not really
suppose to talk about him.

423
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,300
Well, if he is going to stay here
he should now.

424
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,500
Guys, guys,
I know about Tai Lung.

425
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,700
He was a student. The first to ever
master the 1000 scrolls of Kung Fu.

426
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,000
And then he turned bad
and now he's in jail.

427
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,400
He wasn't just a student.

428
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,400
<i>Shifu found him as a cub.</i>

429
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
<i>And he raised him as his son.</i>

430
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
<i>And when the boy showed
talent in Kung Fu...</i>

431
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,600
<i>...Shifu trained him.</i>

432
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,000
<i>He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.</i>

433
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,900
<i>It was never enough for Tai Lung.</i>

434
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,400
<i>He wanted the Dragon Scroll.</i>

435
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,200
<i>But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.</i>

436
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,300
<i>Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the Valley.</i>

437
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>He tried to take the Scroll by force.</i>

438
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,300
<i>And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.</i>

439
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,900
<i>But how could he?</i>

440
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,800
<i>Shifu loved Tai Lung like
he had never love anyone before.</i>

441
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
<i>Or since.</i>

442
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

443
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,500
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

444
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,700
And he is stuck with you.

445
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,200
A big fat Panda
who treats it like a joke.

446
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,300
- Ohh... That's it!
- Wait! My fault!

447
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
I accidentally tweaked
his facial nerves.

448
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,100
And may have also stopped his heart.

449
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
Inner peace.

450
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Inner peace.

451
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Inner...in...in...in
inner peace.

452
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,900
Look, whoever is making that
flapping sound, quiet down.

453
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Inner...

454
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,400
Oh, Zeng. Excellent.

455
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,500
I could use some good news right now.

456
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,600
Master. Master.

457
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,800
I... I... have... It's a...
It's a very bad news.

458
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:58,000
Aah, Shifu. There's just news.
There's no good or bad.

459
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,600
Master, your vision...
Your vision was right.

460
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

461
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,900
That is bad news...

462
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,600
...if you do not believe that
the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

463
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,900
Panda? Master, that Panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.

464
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,100
He wasn't even meant to be here.
It was an accident.

465
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,000
There are no accidents.

466
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yes, I know.
You said that already.

467
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,400
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident either.

468
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,800
- Thrice.
- My old friend.

469
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,800
The Panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you, yours.

470
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,400
Until you let go of the
illusion of control.

471
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,800
- Illusion?
- Yes.

472
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,100
Look at this tree, Shifu.

473
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,000
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me.

474
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,400
Nor make it bear
fruit before it's time.

475
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,200
But there are things
we can control.

476
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,900
I can control when
the fruit will fall.

477
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,500
And I can control...

478
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,200
...where to plant the seed.

479
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,300
That is no illusion, Master.

480
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:18,300
Ah yes, but no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

481
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,500
You may wish for
an apple or an orange.

482
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,900
- But you will get a peach.
- But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung.

483
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Maybe it can, if you are willing
to guide it, to nurture it.

484
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,800
To believe in it.

485
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,700
But how? How?
I need your help, Master.

486
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,700
No, you just need to believe.

487
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,600
Promise me, Shifu.
Promise me, you will believe.

488
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,500
- I... I will try.
- Good.

489
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,400
My time has come.

490
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,900
You must continue your journey
without me.

491
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,600
What?...what?...what are you...
Wait!

492
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,000
Master.

493
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,200
You can't leave me.

494
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,700
You must believe.

495
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,000
Master!

496
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,500
- I'm not scared.
- Yeah. Sound like fun. He maybe a wolf.

497
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,500
You may be the scariest bandit
in Harjin Province.

498
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,300
- But you're a lousy tipper.
- Really.

499
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,300
So, how did you
get out of there alive?

500
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,400
I mean, I didn't actually said that,
but I thought it, in my mind.

501
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,500
If he could read my mind
he would have been like...what?

502
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,000
Order up!
You like it?

503
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,900
This is really good.

504
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,700
Now, come on. You should try
my dad's secret ingredient soup.

505
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,300
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

506
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

507
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,300
- Wow, you are really a good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

508
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,600
Tigress, you got to try
Hmm...

509
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,800
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can
survive for months at a time on nothing...

510
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,200
...but the dew of a single Gingko leaf
and the energy of the universe.

511
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,700
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

512
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,600
I need lot more than dew
and the universe juice.

513
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,900
- What?
- Oh, nothing, Master Shifu.

514
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,800
You will never be the Dragon Warrior
unless you lose 500 pounds...

515
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,300
...and brush your teeth.
What is the noise you're making?

516
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,100
Laughter?
I have never heard of it.

517
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,400
Work hard Panda and maybe someday
you'll have ears like mine.

518
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,600
That's good.
Oh...oh, yup.

519
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,400
Ears?
It's not working for you.

520
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
- I thought they're pretty good.
- It's Shifu!

521
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,900
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

522
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,100
Master Shifu.

523
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,200
You think this is funny!
Tai Lung has escaped from prison!

524
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,200
- And you all are acting like children!
- What?

525
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,400
He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and
you're the only one who can stop him.

526
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,800
And here I am saying you've
got no a sense of humour.

527
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,700
I am gonna... step down.
What? You're serious?

528
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,300
And I have to... I... No...
Master Oogway will stop him.

529
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,400
- He did it before. He'll do it again.
- Oogway can not!

530
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,500
- Not anymore.
- Ha?

531
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,600
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

532
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,300
- The Panda?
- Yes, the Panda!

533
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,900
Master please, let us stop Tai Lung?
This is what you train us for!

534
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,000
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung! It is his!

535
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,000
Where did he go?

536
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,800
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits!

537
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,100
Watch me!

538
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,800
Come on! How am I suppose
to beat Tai Lung?

539
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,000
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

540
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,100
You will beat him because
you are the Dragon Warrior.

541
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,400
You don't believe that!

542
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,200
You never believed that.

543
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,200
From the first moment I got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.

544
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,600
Yes, I was!

545
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,700
But now I ask you to trust in your Master
as I have come to trust in mine.

546
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,400
You are not my Master.
And I am not the Dragon Warrior.

547
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,900
Then why didn't you quit?
You knew I was trying to get rid of you.

548
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,000
- Yet you stayed.
- Ya. I stayed.

549
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,400
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head...

550
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,200
...or said I smelled, it hurt!

551
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,500
But it could never hurt more than
it did everyday in my life just being me.

552
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,500
I stayed because I thought
if anyone could change me,...

553
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,100
...could make me, not me...

554
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,700
...it was you. The greatest
Kung Fu teacher of all of China.

555
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,400
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior. And I will!

556
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,000
Come on, Tai Lung is
on his way right now.

557
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,300
And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here.

558
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,000
How are you gonna to change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

559
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,600
Hah?

560
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,200
How?

561
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,700
How?

562
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,500
- How?
- I don't know!

563
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,800
I don't know.

564
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's what I thought.

565
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,100
This is what you trained me for.

566
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,000
Tigress!

567
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,300
Don't try to stop me.

568
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,400
- We are not trying to stop you.
- What?

569
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
We are coming with you.

570
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,800
What?
I eat when I am upset, okay!

571
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,600
Oh! No need to explain.

572
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,600
I just thought you might be monkey.
He hides his almond cookies in the top-shelf.

573
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,600
Don't tell Monkey.

574
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Look at you.

575
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,700
- Yeah, I know. I disgust you.
- No, I mean, how did you get up there?

576
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,900
I don't know,... I just...
I don't know. Just get the cookies.

577
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,300
And yet you are 10 feet off the ground
and have done a perfect split.

578
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,300
No, this?
This is just an accident!

579
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,800
There are no accidents.

580
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
Come with me.

581
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,000
I know you are trying to be
all mystical and Kung Fu-ey.

582
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,700
But could you least tell me
where we are going?

583
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,200
You drag me all the way
out here for a bath?

584
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,300
Panda, we do not wash our pits
in the pool of sacred tears.

585
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,800
Uuh?...The pool of...

586
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,500
This is where Oogway unraveled
the mysteries of harmony and focus.

587
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,600
This is the birth place of Kung Fu.

588
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,300
- Do you want to learn Kung Fu?
- Yeah.

589
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,000
- Then I am your Master.
- Okay!

590
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
- Don't cry.
- Okay.

591
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,600
When you focus on Kung Fu,
when you concentrate, you stink.

592
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,700
But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot
train you the way I've trained the Five.

593
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,400
I now see that the way to get
through to you is with this.

594
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,500
Great, cause I am hungry.

595
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,000
Good, when you have been trained
you may eat.

596
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,200
Let's begin.

597
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,100
After you, Panda.

598
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,100
Just like that?
No setups? No, ten-mile hike?

599
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,500
I vowed to train you and you've been
trained. You are free to eat.

600
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,700
Enjoy.

601
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,700
- Hey!
- I said you are free to eat.

602
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,600
Have a dumpling.

603
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,000
- You are free to eat.
- Am I?

604
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,000
Are you?

605
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,900
I am not hungry.

606
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,400
Master.

607
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,200
Cut it!

608
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,000
- Where is the Dragon Warrior?
- How do you know you are not looking at her?

609
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,000
You think I'm a fool.

610
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,700
I know you are not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

611
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,100
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire.

612
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,700
But he's a warrior unlike anything
in the world has ever seen.

613
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,200
- Po?
- So that is his name.

614
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,100
Po!

615
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,400
Finally, a worthy opponent.

616
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
Our battle will be legendary.

617
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,300
We got this, help her.

618
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,100
- Monkey!
- Go!

619
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,200
Mantis!

620
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,500
Now!

621
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,900
Shifu, taught you well.

622
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,600
But he didn't teach you everything.

623
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,100
- You have done well, Panda.
- Done well?

624
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,000
Done well!
I have done awesome!

625
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,400
The mark of a true hero is humility.

626
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,500
But yes,
you have done, awesome.

627
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,800
Guys? Guys!

628
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,900
They're dead.
No, they are breathing.

629
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,100
They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

630
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,300
We were no match
for his nerve attack.

631
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,600
He has gotten stronger.

632
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,500
Who? Tai Lung?
Stronger?

633
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,500
He's too fast.
Sorry, Po.

634
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,600
- I thought we could stop him.
- He could have kill you.

635
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,900
- Why didn't he?
- So you can come back here...

636
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,500
...and strike fear into our hearts.
But it won't work.

637
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,300
It might. I mean a little.

638
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,800
- I'm pretty scared.
- You can defeat him, Panda.

639
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,900
Are you kidding?
If they can't... They're Five Masters.

640
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,500
I'm just one me.

641
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,100
But you have the one thing
that no one else does.

642
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,500
You really believe I'm ready?

643
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,300
You are, Po.

644
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,600
Behold, the Dragon Scroll.

645
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,000
- It is yours.
- Wait.

646
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,900
- What happens when I read it?
- No one knows.

647
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,200
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wings beat.

648
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,200
- Wow! Really? That's cool.
- Yes!

649
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,500
And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.

650
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,400
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?

651
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,700
- Focus. Focus. Focus!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

652
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,700
Read it Po,
and fulfill your destiny.

653
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:59,100
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.

654
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,600
It's impossible to open.

655
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,800
Come on! Come on, now!

656
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,600
Thank you.

657
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,800
Probably, loosen it up for you.

658
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,800
Okay, here goes.

659
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,300
- It's blank.
- What?

660
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,800
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

661
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:49,100
Blank! I don't...
I don't understand.

662
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:56,000
Okay. So like Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

663
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,700
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

664
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,600
Oh, come on.
Face it. He picked me by accident.

665
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,500
Of course, I'm not Dragon Warrior.

666
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,700
Who am I kidding?

667
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,100
- But who will stop Tai Lung?
- He will destroy everything.

668
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,200
- And everyone.
- No.

669
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,300
Evacuate the Valley.
You must protect the villagers...

670
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,000
...from Tai Lung's rage.

671
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,300
What about you, Master?

672
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,900
- I will fight him.
- What?

673
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,600
I can hold him off long enough
for everyone to escape.

674
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,400
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

675
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,500
Then I would have finally
paid for my mistake.

676
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,900
Listen to me, all of you.

677
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,600
It's time for you to continue
your journey without me.

678
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,200
I am very proud to have
been your master.

679
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
We got to get them out safely.

680
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,400
Come little one,
let's find your Mama.

681
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,900
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

682
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,900
Crane, light the way.

683
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,800
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

684
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,100
Hey Dad.

685
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,200
Po!

686
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,800
It's good to have you back son.

687
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,000
- Good to be back.
- Let's go, Po.

688
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:09,400
For our next shop, it's time to face it.
The future of noodles is diced cut vegetables.

689
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,900
No longer slices.
Also, I was thinking...

690
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,900
...maybe this time we'll have
a kitchen you can stand up in.

691
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,500
You like that?

692
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,500
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
It just wasn't meant to be.

693
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:43,300
Po, forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.

694
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,300
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

695
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,300
I don't know dad. Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

696
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,600
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

697
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
...a long time ago.

698
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,700
Okay.

699
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,600
The secret ingredient of
my secret ingredient soup.

700
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,800
Come near me.
The secret ingredient is...

701
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,800
- Nothing!
- Hah?

702
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,200
You heard me.
Nothing!

703
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,900
There is no secret ingredient.

704
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,100
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

705
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,500
You don't add some kind
of special sauce or something.

706
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,000
Don't have to.
To make something special...

707
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,900
...you just have to believe
it's special.

708
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,700
There is no secret ingredient.

709
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,200
I have come home, Master.

710
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,000
This is no longer your home
and I am no longer your master.

711
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,700
Yes, you have a new favourite.

712
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,400
So where is this Po?

713
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,700
- Did I scare him off?
- This battle is between you and me.

714
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,300
- So that's how it's going to be.
- That is how it must be.

715
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,500
I rotted in jail for 20 years...

716
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,400
...because of your weakness!
- Obeying your master is not weakness!

717
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,600
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!

718
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,700
You always knew.
But when Oogway said otherwise...

719
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,100
...what did you do?

720
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,800
What did you do?

721
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,600
- Nothing! - You were not meant
to be the Dragon Warrior.

722
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,900
- That was not my fault!
- Not your fault?

723
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,300
Who filled my head with dreams?

724
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,700
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?

725
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,900
Who denied me and my destiny?

726
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,200
It was never my decision to make!

727
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,700
It is now.

728
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,400
- Give me the Scroll.
- I would rather die!

729
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,500
What I ever did,
I did to make you proud!

730
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,700
Tell me how proud you are Shifu!

731
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,800
Tell me!
Tell me!

732
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,800
I...I have always
been proud of you.

733
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,200
From the first moment,
I have been proud of you.

734
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,900
And it was my pride
that blinded me.

735
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,900
I love you too much to see
what you were becoming.

736
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,500
What I was turning you into.

737
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,800
I'm... I'm sorry.

738
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't want your apology.
I want my Scroll.

739
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,400
What?

740
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,700
Where is it?

741
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,900
Dragon Warrior has taken Scroll
half way across China by now.

742
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,300
You will never see
that Scroll, Tai Lung!

743
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,400
Never!

744
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,400
Hey!

745
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,100
Stairs.

746
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,900
Who are you?

747
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

748
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,800
You?

749
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,700
Him? He's a Panda.
You're a Panda.

750
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,500
What are you going to do, big guy?
Sit on me.

751
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,700
Don't tempt me.

752
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,800
Now, I'm going to use this.

753
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,700
You want it. Come get it.

754
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,500
Finally.

755
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,600
That Scroll is mine!

756
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,200
The Scroll has given him power.

757
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,000
No!

758
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,400
Finally.
Oh, yes.

759
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,700
The power of the Dragon Scroll
is mine!

760
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,000
It's nothing!

761
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,800
It's okay. I didn't get
it the first time either.

762
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,600
- What?
- There is no secret ingredient.

763
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,000
It's just you.

764
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,900
Stop it! Ho, ho, ho.
I'm going to pee.

765
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,700
Don't! No, don't.

766
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,100
You can't defeat me.

767
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,700
You...

768
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:37,400
You're just a big
fat Panda!

769
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm not a big fat Panda.

770
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,600
I'm the Big Fat Panda!

771
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,500
The Wuxi finger hold?
Oh, you know this hold.

772
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,200
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that!

773
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,800
Nope. I figured it out.

774
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,600
Skadoosh!

775
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,000
Look!

776
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,200
The Dragon Warrior.

777
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:54,300
That's my boy! The big lovely
Kung Fu warrior is my son!

778
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,300
Yes.

779
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,700
Thanks Dad.

780
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,400
Hey guys.

781
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:19,600
- Master.
- Master.

782
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,800
Master?
Master Shifu?

783
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,100
Master!
Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

784
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,600
Po.
You are alive.

785
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,500
Or we are both dead.

786
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,400
No Master, I didn't die.

787
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,700
- I defeated Tai Lung.
- You did?

788
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:03,000
Wow!
It is as Oogway foretold.

789
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,400
You are the Dragon Warrior.

790
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,400
You have brought peace
to this valley.

791
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,800
And to me.
Thank you.

792
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Thank you, Po.

793
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,400
Thank you. Thank you...

794
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,500
No, Master...

795
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,000
No, no, no!
Don't die Shifu, please!

796
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:42,000
I'm not dying, you idiot!
Aah... Dragon Warrior.

797
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:48,500
I'm simply at peace.
Finally.

798
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,000
So I should stop talking.

799
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
If you can.

800
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
Do you want to get
something to eat?

801
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,700
Yes.

802
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,500
