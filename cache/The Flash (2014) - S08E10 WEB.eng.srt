How it's killing

coming after her too,

with flames that generate
a cold so intense, it burns?

220
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,718
That last item is almost
an exact description

221
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,284
of how cold fusion works.

222
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,939
But why is the fire
attracted to Frost?

223
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,202
I believe it's because
her meta-abilities

224
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,597
are cryo-kinetic,
just like our cold fusion fire.

225
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,296
So you think it's hunting her
for fuel to recharge itself?

226
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,297
Correct.

227
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,212
So the key to catching it

228
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,475
is to wait until it comes after
her again and then trap it.

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,390
Frost, we're not
using you as bait.

Why won't you at least
let us try?

234
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,963
Because this feels
like a last resort.

235
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,965
Besides, there's still so much
we don't know about this fire.

236
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,967
I mean, even if we tried this,

237
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,490
we still
have no way to capture it.

238
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,449
Cold fusion is still
a fusion reaction,

239
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,191
one that occurs
at a low molecular temperature.

240
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,542
If we could build some kind of
fusion containment housing...

241
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,589
Then all we'd need to do
is recalibrate the unit

242
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,156
to absorb and amplify
Frost's cryo-kinetic signature.

243
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,898
Yes. Then as long as Frost
is in proximity,

244
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,684
the unit can amplify
her cryo-kinetic signature

245
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,076
and attract the fire,

246
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,080
allowing us to capture
and imprison it.

247
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,647
Of course,
building a unit like that

248
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,084
could take weeks or longer, but...

249
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:11,654
Well, not that I'm saying
we should do this at all,

250
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,832

what you're describing.
