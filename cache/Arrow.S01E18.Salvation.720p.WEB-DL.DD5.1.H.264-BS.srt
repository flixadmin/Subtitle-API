1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:04,295
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,497
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:09,632
survive.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,467
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,702
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:16,270
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,072
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:23,376
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:27,247
I must become something else.

10
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:28,748
<i>Previously on</i>
Arrow...

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,516
- Mom?
- What are you doing here?

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:32,485
I believe Sarah's still alive.

13
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:34,088
You don't actually
have any proof.

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,490
I have proof.
Doesn't it look just like Sarah?

15
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:39,492
I did manage
to find one thing.

16
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:39,494
Does that symbol mean
something to you, sir?

17
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,463
I want to get out.

18
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:46,432
Malcolm Merlyn.
I want you to kill him for me.

19
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:50,369
We have a traitor
in our midst.

20
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,738
He just made his last mistake.

21
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,842
Lawyers for John Nickels
spoke to the press today.

22
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:59,178
They say they're pleased
the D.A. declined to indict

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,713
their client on charges
stemming from the recent fire

24
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:03,315
in one of Nickel's buildings.

25
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,750
John Nickel
is one of the wealthiest

26
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:06,718
real estate developers
in Starling City.

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,420
He's also one of the dirtiest.

28
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:10,588
That building
that burnt down last night?

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,558
Wiring was not up to code.
Maybe he didn't know that.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,504
I guess he also didn't know

31
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:16,361
about the seven people
who have frozen to death

32
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:17,795
in his other buildings
over the past three years.

33
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:19,797
Yeah, he's a real
man of the people.

34
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,767
Not for long.

35
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:26,570
The D.A. ignores this,
and the police can't do anything

36
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:28,138
because all these slums

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,541
are in the Glades.
So tonight, Felicity,

38
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:33,777
we cross Mr. Nickel's name
off the list.

39
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,114
You ok with that?

40
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,349
The scene outside
of the courtroom

41
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,717
where Nickel was
released this afternoon

42
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,686
was not surprisingly tense.

43
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,788
100 percent.

44
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:28,231
Hello?

45
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,634
Aahh!

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,553
He was just gone?

47
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:25,056
No! Not gone. Taken.

48
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,258
Looks like Nickel was on
somebody else's list, too.

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,327
After the fire last night,
it's not entirely surprising.

50
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,295
Felicity, I need you

51
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:32,797
to get me everything
that you can on Nickel.

52
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,432
Focus on his tenants,
and anyone who might have

53
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,369
filed a formal complaint
against him, or...

54
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,036
people that lost
something in the fire.

55
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,771
Well, it's going to be some
list. I mean, slum lords

56
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,506
aren't generally known
for their popularity.

57
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:45,776
- Plus...
- What?

58
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:48,410
Nothing, it's just--

59
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:49,818
you went over there to be

60
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,440
all, "grrr, stop being bad
or I'll arrow you,"

61
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,505
and now you want to rescue him.

62
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,807
I don't like the idea that
somebody dangerous is out there.

63
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,844
Somebody else.

64
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,980
Because typically...

65
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,415
They don't show
my level of restraint.

66
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,150
So you're going
to cross Nickel off anyway?

67
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:09,619
No.

68
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,754
I'm finding somebody else
who needs a talking to.

69
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,656
You're going out
there again, Oliver?

70
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,024
Why don't you go home and
be with your family, man?

71
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:17,559
That's when the work
is done, Diggle.

72
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,093
Ok, then I'll take
you out to dinner.

73
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,494
I'm not hungry.

74
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,328
I'm not asking.

75
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,001
Simple exchange.

76
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,702
You get us a way
off the island,

77
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:33,769
and we'll give you
the circuit board

78
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,136
so that your missile launcher

79
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:36,637
isn't just furniture.

80
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,171
You've grown up quite
a bit, Mr. Queen.

81
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,473
I'll give you that.

82
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,809
I can get you a boat.

83
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,044
But I need time.

84
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:48,780
You got an hour, Fyers,
and then you're never--

85
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,581
what?!

86
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,318
We understand it might take you
longer than an hour to get a boat.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,254
What we mean is you need
to move with some dispatch.

88
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,157
Ah, Wilson, still
in command there, eh?

89
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,193
I thought your little pet
had staged a coup d'etat.

90
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,696
Just get us the damn boat.

91

93
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,056
Mmm.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,326
Now you want to stop?

95
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,128
Well, we don't all have butlers.

96
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,131
You know, some of us actually
have to answer our own doors.

97
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,533
Oh, the horror.

98
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,739
You look familiar.

99
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,674
Did I see you
on TV or something?

100
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,711
Probably.
I'm Thea Queen.

101
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:45,979
Yeah, right.

102
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:47,447
Did you get it?

103
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,782
Tomorrow night.

104
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,117
Joe wants us there at 11 p.m.

105
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,253
He said to be on time, Harper.

106
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,293
What's happening
tomorrow at 11:00?

107
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:01,794
You know, I'm actually
kind of focused on

108
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,096
what's happening right now.

109
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:05,364
- Oh, ok.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:11,071
No, no, Thea, don't!

111
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,908
Why do you have a gun?

112
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,977
Because I'm no good with knives.

113
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,980
Look, it's just a liquor store.

114
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,883
The guy's a creep.
Trust me, he deserves it.

115
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:27,186
Look, if it'll make you
feel any better...

116
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,623
I won't be armed.

117
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,292
But of course, the owner
won't know that, but...

118
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:36,195
I got you a job
at my brother's club.

119
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,831
You have choices.
You don't have to be a criminal!

120
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,834
I'm not talking about
phone bills.

121
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,169
I owe people.

122
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:45,438
People with much
bigger guns than this.

123
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,206
Look, here in the Glades,

124
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,142
this is pretty much
the only solution.

125
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:52,878
No, lots of people in the Glades
live honest lives.

126
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,079
Obviously not you.

127
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,849
- You're just a waste.
- No, Thea.

128
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,417
Thea!

129
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,119
I'm going to make sure
you get home ok.

130
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,354
Don't bother.

131
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

132
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,530
Yeah.

133
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:17,004
Yeah.

134
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,807
Hey, honey.

135
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,676
There you go.

136
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,145
Um, what's all this?

137
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:28,782
Well, you asked me to look into
your mother's leads on Sarah,

138
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:30,184
so I made some calls.

139
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:32,753
It looks like you did a lot
more than that.

140
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,989
Well, yeah, but you're the one who
said we should do this, Laurel,

141
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,525
so, you know, if there's even a
chance that your sister is--

142
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,026
- yeah, but--
- Thank you.

143
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,996
Hi, sweetheart,
I'm sorry about the mess.

144
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:44,523
Quentin, I just got off the phone
with the consulate in Phuket.

145
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:46,825
The secretary there's
going to run Sarah's photo

146
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:48,875
against their database,
see if there's a match.

147
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:50,982
That's good work.

148
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,720
What?

149
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,823
Well, I guess I just
thought deep down

150
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,025
that you were going
to help mom...

151
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:03,061
accept things.

152
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,230
Things you and I accepted.

153
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,202
Um...

154
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:13,038
Yeah, but...

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,140
You got to admit.

156
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:18,612
This girl, she looks
a lot like Sarah.

157
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,081
Sarah had that same cap.
The Starling City Rockets.

158
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,250
Your dad bought it
for her, remember?

159
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,054
Yeah, I remember.

160
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,056
Stranger things have happened.

161
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:32,061
Yeah. I can see that.

162
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,139
Hungrier than I thought.

163
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:44,176
Are you waiting for me to finish
before giving me the lecture?

164
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,847
Oliver, you've been
spending a lot of time

165
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,281
under that hood
the last couple weeks.

166
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,350
Keeps my ears warm.

167
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,886
And you made
this decision to, um,

168
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,821
avoid entanglements?

169
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,444
For their protection.

170
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,158
The people who get
close to me get hurt.

171
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:02,160
What's the problem?

172
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,962
Do you think
I'm losing my grip?

173
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:07,632
No, it's just the opposite,
really. You seem calm.

174
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,635
Scary calm.

175
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:12,037
I get that things didn't end well
with Helena, with McKenna...

176
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,040
With Laurel.

177
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,608
With Sarah.

178
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,277
- The list goes on.
- Yeah. But what do you do?

179
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,846
You hood up, you go home, you repeat.
It's not much of a life.

180
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:22,682
Well, the life that I'm leading
for myself right now

181
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:27,086
doesn't leave much room
for an actual life.

182
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,255
- And I don't need one.
- Wow.

183
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,657
That's a pretty bleak future
you plan on spending... with no one.

184
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,829
I'm used to isolation.

185
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,664
And that is exactly
what worries me.

186
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,066
You've been home
for 8 months, Oliver,

187
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,801
but I don't think
you left that island yet.

188
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,340
What the hell is going on?

189
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:52,111
Yeah?

190
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,813
Found Nickel. Click
the link I just sent you.

191
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:56,082
This came up on every screen
with an I.P. address

192
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,917
originating from the Glades.

193
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:01,788
If you make
the Glades your home,

194
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,256
you know who this man is.

195
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,158
John Nickel.

196
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,127
He owns your tenements.

197
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,130
Manages your slums.

198
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:14,233
Provides the leaking
roofs over your head.

199
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:15,835
The mold in your pipes

200
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,937
and asbestos in your walls.

201
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:23,309
Basically, he makes money
off our suffering.

202
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,277
But the police aren't
interested in helping us.

203
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,447
They may have let us down,
but I won't.

204
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,150
John, I want to give you
the chance to state your case.

205
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:35,987
Why shouldn't you be punished?

206
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:41,158
I knew there was
bad stuff in my buildings.

207
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,061
Track him, Felicity.

208
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:46,797
- I'm looking.
- <i>Ok, yes, I made a little profit!</i>

209
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,700
At least they had
a place to live.

210
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,770
Without me, people like that
would end up on the street.

211
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,972
"People like that."

212
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:59,276
That's all we are
to guys like this.

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,882
- Aaah!
- Don't.

214
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,454
I find you...

215
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:13,223
Guilty.

216
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,414
There are plenty more
people who need to answer

217
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,439
for their crimes against us.

218
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:29,373
So...

219
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,608
Who's next?

220
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,622
- Anything new?
- This guy's definitely

221
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,357
got more than
a subscription to "Wired."

222
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,259
His website's protected
by some very serious encryption.

223
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,329
Well, use that air magnet thing,
you said that it could trace--

224
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:42,420
Oliver! No offense.

225
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,098
Do I tell you how
to sharpen your arrows?

226
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,732
Spoke to my friend at the NSA.

227
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:49,069
The website code matches a cyber
crusader who's been on their radar.

228
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:52,773
He hacks into fringe sites
under the user name "The Savior."

229
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,641
NSA believes he's a former
resident of the Glades.

230
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:55,976
- Former?
- Yeah, well, a year ago,

231
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,512
he hacked himself
right off the radar.

232
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,047
He erased all traces
of his existence.

233
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,148
So what happened a year ago?

234
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,583
We're back.

235
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:04,886
I have with me assistant
district attorney

236
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:07,956
Gavin Carnahan.

237
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,560
Now, DAs are supposed
to go after bad guys.

238
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:14,596
But this one can't even be
bothered to bring them to trial.

239
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:17,798
Like the ones who killed
my wife in a bodega.

240
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,767
- Felicity...
- I'm on it.

241
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,237
They said there wasn't
enough evidence.

242
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,606
You think the evidence
would have turned up

243
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:27,057
if she'd been killed
in one of Starling City's

244
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,643
nicer neighborhoods?

245
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,611
Emma Falk. Grieving husband
is Joseph Falk.

246
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,180
What do we have on him?
Not much.

247
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,748
42, former city worker.

248
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,183
Department of transportation,
computer technician,

249
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,185
left his job when she was killed.
One year ago today.

250
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,254
No current phone,
no current address.

251
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:44,824
Gavin, you're a lawyer.
You're used to making a case.

252
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,626
So go ahead.

253
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:49,595
I'm going to give you
ten minutes to deliver

254
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:52,699
the closing argument of your life.
Come on.

255
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,533
I'm trying to get a lock
on his wireless signal.

256
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:58,070
10 minutes to convince
me not to blow you away.

257
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:11,083
What did Malcolm want
with you at the hospital?

258
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,153
A target for reprisal.

259
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:17,156
He wants justice, and he's not
going to stop until he gets it.

260
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:19,826
Besides, this is good.

261
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,662
I think your definition of good
requires an adjustment.

262
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,965
No, he came to me.
Which means he doesn't know

263
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:29,103
that we're responsible
for the attempt on his life.

264
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,772
Yet.

265
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,144
What are the chances
of Malcolm discovering

266
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,113
who paid the triad
to assassinate him?

267
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:40,738
I was very discreet.

268
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,183
I wired the money through
a shell corporation I own,

269
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,819
from an offshore account.
Offshore?

270
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:49,189
Good.
That's good.

271
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,195
I'm sending Amanda
to London for a few weeks,

272
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,197
just as a precaution.

273
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,701
Perhaps you should
do the same for your family.

274
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,237
There's nothing I wouldn't do

275
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,706
to protect my children, Frank.

276
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,527
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

277
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,762
Almost woman to woman.

278
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,165
I'm really busy right now.

279
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,134
Ok.

280
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,540
Thea.

281
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,242
Sorry.

282
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:45,010
What's up?

283
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:47,713
I could use some advice.

284
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,749
I'm sort of dating this guy

285
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,918
who would definitely be
described as a bad boy.

286
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,488
And I figured,
as someone who's dated

287
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,856
like a gajillion of them...

288
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:00,458
I haven't dated a gajillion.

289
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,928
All right, guilty as charged.

290
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,732
You want my advice? Run.

291
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,100
As fast as you possibly can.

292
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:11,237
Yeah. See, that was my first
instinct, too, but--

293
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,739
Laurel?

294
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,607
The Chinese embassy's
on line two.

295
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,743
I'm transferring him over.

296
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:18,578
Chinese embassy?

297
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,913
It's just this case
that I'm working on.

298
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,717
But we are definitely continuing
this conversation later.

299
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:31,424
Thank you so much
for getting back to me.

300
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:33,300
I'm trying to track down
a woman in the photo

301
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,325
that I emailed you.

302
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,799
You did.

303
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,334
Really?

304
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:49,208
And you're sure that
she's in the states now?

305
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:53,146
Do you happen to have
an address on her?

306
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,154
- I got him!
- Shut it down.

307
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:04,490
Can't. He has a firewall
protecting his wireless signal.

308
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,659
But he's working off an IPX
located at 23rd and Mira.

309
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:09,662
- You want to hood up?
- The middle of the day!

310
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:27,214
Look! Listen.
Listen to me. Ok.

311
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:30,851
I have 53 cases
on my desk right now.

312
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:33,754
I don't always have time
to take on every case!

313
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:34,889
How's Carnahan?

314
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,758
Not making a very
persuasive argument.

315
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,192
I'm almost there.

316
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:55,243
See anything?
I'm only on the first floor.

317
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,646
Just six more to go.

318
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,749
There aren't resources.
I tried.

319
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,284
- Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
- Oliver, hurry.

320
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:08,824
Can't find him!

321
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,106
- He's not here, Felicity!
- What?!

322
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,174
I searched every office
on every floor!

323
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:29,244
He's not here.
Is this the right place?

324
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,880
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I--

325
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:34,483
Oh, crap.
What?

326
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,719
How is this possible?!
This can't happen! He's--

327
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,622
- Talk to me!
- Wait.

328
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,224
He moved. Just north of you.
Ocean and Grand.

329
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,326
On my way!

330
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,939
I took on cases that were--that I
thought that I could...

331
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,940
- Win.
- Yes.

332
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,643
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,702
Gavin Carnahan,
I find you guilty

334
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,004
of crimes against the Glades.

335
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:30,972
Don't do this!
Don't do this!

336
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:32,941
And I sentence you to death.

337
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:36,144
I'm at Ocean and Grand, Felicity.
That's just a vacant lot.

338
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,879
How is this possible?
This can't happen. He--

339
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,984
Find the right address, now!

340
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,321
He's...

341
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,834
Oliver, it's over,
Carnahan is dead.

342
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:11,712
Where's Diggle?

343
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,348
I asked him to leave me alone.

344
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,318
In my loud voice.

345
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,391
This wasn't your fault.

346
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,027
I was the one who was supposed
to find Carnahan,

347
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,754
and I was the one
who sent you that bogus location.

348
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:32,724
I've never seen anybody die.

349
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,027
Hey.

350
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:37,829
This is the thing

351
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,631
with what we do.

352
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,767
Sometimes we lose.

353
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:49,109
Maybe it is better being alone.

354
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,378
I'm not seeing anyone
currently, but...

355
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,280
If I were,

356
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,849
I don't know how I'd tell him
about today.

357
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,434
Gentlemen. Welcome.

358
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:16,570
So happy we were able
to reach an accord.

359
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,739
Oh, good.
Small talk.

360
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:21,008
Are we going
to get on with this?

361
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,077
As you wish.
Straight to business.

362
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,812
The circuit board.
Where is it?

363
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,647
Somewhere safe.

364
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,516
So get us to the boat and then
we'll tell you where it is.

365
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,821
And of course you'll be honest
about its location.

366
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:34,155
Well, I wouldn't be.

367
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:36,024
But this one's got
some strange hang up

368
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,560
about principles
and integrity.

369
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,829
I always imagined as much.

370
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,065
Which is why I'd like to
make a counter proposal.

371
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,433
Men!

372
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:54,409
No!

373
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:56,045
No!

374
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:00,749
You will deliver back
to me the circuit board,

375
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,918
or I will kill
Yao Fei's daughter.

376
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,356
So I wouldn't leave.

377
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:09,691
I can't imagine
you want the death

378
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,326
of an innocent young
woman on your hands.

379
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:13,628
Not with your...
Principles.

380
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,168
Hey.

381
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:26,074
Hi.

382
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,777
I wanted to do
some research on my own

383
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,812
into the evidence
that you gathered on Sarah.

384
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:33,781
So I called my friend
from law school

385
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:38,419
who works at the Chinese
embassy, and...

386
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:41,456
The photo of the girl.

387
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,857
I found her.

388
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:46,361
I'm sorry. Can I--
can I borrow your phone?

389
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:47,729
I promised my fianée
that I'd call him before dinner.

390
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,731
My phone's dead.

391
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,867
Jen, these are my parents.

392
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,870
Hi. Nice to meet you.

393
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,108
Yeah, you, too.

394
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,310
I just told Jen
about this photograph

395
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:04,080
that popped up in this case
that I'm working on.

396
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:07,350
Is that you in the picture?

397
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:09,619
Yeah. I spent six months

398
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,754
on an island
off the coast of China.

399
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:13,822
That was taken
in a small fishing village

400
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,124
called Zhengjiu.

401
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,360
It's Mandarin for...

402
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,829
Salvation.

403
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:29,173
Are you all right, Mrs. Lance?

404
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,075
Yes, I--

405
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:32,543
it's just, uh,

406
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,912
you look like
someone I used to know.

407
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,031
Wow.

408
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,201
I was waiting for this.

409
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:58,936
Waiting for what?

410
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:02,473
The whole "You can change,
I can see the real you" speech.

411
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,008
Look around, Thea.

412
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,377
This is home sweet home for me.

413
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,945
You either starve
or you do things

414
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,647
that mean you're lucky
enough to make it to 21.

415
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,782
- I can't accept that.
- No.

416
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,485
You can't accept me.

417
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,921
- Roy Harper?
- Yeah?

418
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:18,656
Roy!

419
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,601
More on the story
out of the Glades.

420
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,579
The kidnapper seems
to have another victim

421
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,781
and is broadcasting the feed
to his website.

422
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:46,850
A warning to viewers,
this is live footage,

423
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:49,887
so we're not sure
what we're about to see.

424
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:55,527
Meet Roy Harper.

425
00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:00,064
Arrests for larceny

426
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,867
and robbery,
aggravated assault.

427
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,236
And yet you're out
on the street.

428
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:09,306
Another gangbanger
in the Glades running free,

429
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,809
like the ones
who killed my wife.

430
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:14,077
I'm grew up in
the Glades, too.

431
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,847
And it didn't turn me
into a criminal.

432
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,949
I know that kid.

433
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:19,983
- How?
- Tommy!

434
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,518
Tommy?

435
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:28,892
Oh!

436
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:32,294
Oh, God, no.

437
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,330
I didn't know where else to go.

438
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:36,431
- You know him?
- Roy, he's my friend.

439
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,834
And we were in a fight and
some guy came out of nowhere

440
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:40,068
and just attacked us!

441
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,079
He doesn't deserve to die!

442
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,748
I promise you,
he's going to be ok.

443
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,951
You stay here with
Tommy, all right?

444
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,623
Hello?

445
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,291
Moira, it's Malcolm.

446
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,525
I've learned
a high ranking member

447
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,527
of the Triad
was just arrested.

448
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,429
Well, I should have
a word with him.

449
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,199
I already have.
He's agreed to find out

450
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:05,569
who hired his organization
to assassinate me in return

451
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,538
for a reduced prison sentence.

452
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,473
By tonight, we should know
the name, or names,

453
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,541
of the people
who tried to kill me.

454
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,845
Good.

455
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:33,496
What are you doing?

456
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,098
So it's not Sarah
in the photo.

457
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,566
But she's still
out there, Quentin.

458
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,268
And I'm going to find her.

459
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,305
Look, I understand now

460
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,174
that neither of you
have the stomach

461
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,575
to continue looking for her.

462
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,412
And that's fine.

463
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,747
I'm sorry I involved you both.

464
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,283
You know that I would cross
to hell and back

465
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,552
to bring her home,
but I can't!

466
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,121
'Cause she's gone, Di.

467
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,123
No.

468
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,959
You got to let go of this now.

469
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,562
No! I can't!

470
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,398
I won't!

471
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,201
How did you know
Sarah had her hat

472
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,304
with her when she
went on the boat?

473
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:18,979
You were so sure that the girl

474
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,547
in the photo was Sarah.

475
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,418
Not because she was American,
but because of her hat.

476
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,222
Her Starling City Rockets hat
that dad bought her.

477
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,524
Mom.

478
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:33,360
How did you know
she took her hat

479
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:36,330
with her on "the Queen's Gambit"
with Oliver?

480
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,734
I saw her.

481
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:43,704
What do you mean?

482
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:48,141
I came home early that day,

483
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:52,012
and I saw her.

484
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:54,014
Sarah.

485
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:58,018
I saw her put the hat in a bag.

486
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,621
She was packing.

487
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:03,657
You knew she was
going with him?

488
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,994
I told her not to--

489
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:10,698
I told her not to do this,
not to you, Laurel.

490
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,534
But she said she was in love
and she had to follow her heart,

491
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,569
even if nobody else
thought it was right.

492
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:18,972
Just like I told her...

493
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:24,044
Just like I told her I once did.

494
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:26,647
So...

495
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:29,817
I let her go.

496
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,621
I killed her.

497
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:35,556
I...

498
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:41,228
I killed my daughter.

499
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,564
I killed her.

500
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,667
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

501
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:48,269
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

502
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:50,705
I killed our baby.

503
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:57,012
Anything?

504
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,680
I've been going through
all the video we got,

505
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,282
trying to see if there's
anything that'll tell us

506
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:02,517
where this guy is.
I got nothing, except a sound.

507
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,186
Buried in the ambient noise.
Almost rhythmic.

508
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,754
Here, I've isolated it.

509
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:08,424
What is that?

510
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:11,560
Sounds like a car driving
over lane markers.

511
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:13,496
It's bigger than a car.

512
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:15,531
Bigger than a car.
What, a bus? Uh--

513
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:18,468
wait, I know this.

514
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,470
I know it.

515
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:23,573
Come on! Guys!

516
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,976
Felicity, show me a map.
Sights of the abductions

517
00:28:25,978 --> 00:28:28,345
on where we've seen
the signal so far.

518
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:30,515
Right there, right there.

519
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:33,150
23rd and Mira.

520
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,686
Locksley and Adams.

521
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,555
Wells street down by CNRI.

522
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:39,091
Those are all subway stops!
Starling City

523
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,459
doesn't have a subway.

524
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,127
No, but they used to.
When I was a kid,

525
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,695
my dad used to take me down
to the Rockets game.

526
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,465
By subway. For 14 minutes,
I'd lean against the window,

527
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:47,533
feeling the rhythm
of the train moving.

528
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:50,102
That's how he did it.

529
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,105
He was at 23rd and Mira,
but he was underground.

530
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,340
He used to work for the
department of transportation,

531
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,376
so that's why he knows
all the old subway stops.

532
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:57,644
That's why I couldn't
trace the signal.

533
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:59,213
He was moving.
He was in a subway car.

534
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,381
Where is he now?

535
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,249
He's on the old
cross town line.

536
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,684
If he continues on this route,
he'll be at the Spring Street

537
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:06,086
stop in 15 minutes.

538
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,390
Let the girl go.

539
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,028
No deal?

540
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,997
Very well.
Kill her.

541
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,031
No!

542
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,699
No!

543
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,736
That was unexpected.

544
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,941
Fire!

545
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:08,317
Ahh!

546
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,019
Come on!
Come on!

547
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,025
Get her to safety! Now!

548
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:19,694
I'll only slow you down. Go!

549
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:22,096
Just go! You've got to go!

550
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:23,732
Go! Go!

551
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,601
Go!

552
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,628
- It's happening.
- <i>I'll give you 10 minutes</i>

553
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,497
to state your case, Roy.

554
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,465
<i>So tell us.</i>

555
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:03,135
<i>Why do you get to live?</i>

556
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:08,307
I shouldn't.

557
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,509
Just do it.

558
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,747
Kill me.

559
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:24,658
Just go on!
Kill me!

560
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:29,597
You really don't care
if you live or die?

561
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:34,953
No one's going to miss me.

562
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:39,466
I'm just a waste.

563
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:42,169
Then we agree on something.

564
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:46,173
This world would be
better off without you in it.

565
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:58,352
We seem to have lost the feed.

566
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:00,783
We will stay on this story
and keep you up to date

567
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,102
on any developments.

568
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,310
Let the kid go.

569
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,346
You kill this kid,

570
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,948
you'll never get
an opportunity to change!

571
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,051
You can give him
a second chance.

572
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:36,756
We're the only ones
who can save this city.

573
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:37,990
We can't stop now.

574
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:40,826
We're not the same!

575
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,462
You've killed people
for this city, so have I.

576
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:47,133
What's the difference
between you and me?

577
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:51,137
Emma never got
her second chance.

578
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,242
You have no idea
how lonely it is.

579
00:32:56,177 --> 00:32:59,279
Joseph.

580
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:02,049
Joseph!

581
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:05,719
I understand being alone.

582
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:07,354
But it doesn't
give you the right

583
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,390
to kill people in cold blood.

584
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:11,158
He deserves it.

585
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,093
Just like the gangbangers
who gunned her down,

586
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:15,463
he's no different than them.

587
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:18,299
And now I get to gun him down.

588
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:19,967
Don't do it!

589
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,294
Got to get going
to the airport.

590
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,096
That red eye to Central City.

591
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:14,468
I should be home in a flash.

592
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:22,977
Mom.

593
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:28,215
Call me some time.

594
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:30,184
I'd really like that.

595
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,849
You would?

596
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,650
Of course I would.

597
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:37,854
You're my mother.

598
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:43,693
I love you so much.

599
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,861
I love you, too.

600
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:15,157
I thought you were
going to die.

601
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,959
That makes two of us.

602
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:24,165
I probably look like a mess.

603
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,868
I'm going to go
to the bathroom and freshen

604
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,736
way, way up.

605
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,271

00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,641
and she's been...

625

What?

626
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:02,644
She had this crazy idea

that Sarah was still alive.

that she kind of had me
believing it, also.

630

00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,360
Damn. Fyers played us.

649
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:28,529
While he was
screwing us around,

650
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:31,899
his men were combing
the woods for it.

651
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:35,336
Now his missile launcher
is fully operational.

652
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:38,072
And he was never going to
let us off the island, I get it!

653
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:39,407
Of course he wasn't
going to help you.

654
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:40,708
He couldn't chance you
warning the mainland

655
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,643
what he has planned.

656
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:46,013
- She speaks English.
- Yeah, well, guess what.

657
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:49,082
Neither one of us
have any idea what his plans are.

658
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,788
I do.

659
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:02,930
Thank you for coming, Frank.

660
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:04,932
Meeting like this
is dangerous, Moira.

661
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,701
- Particularly now.
- Yes, I know.

662
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:09,102
Malcolm knows.

663
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:10,871
- What?!
- I had no choice

664
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,205
but to turn over
what I've discovered.

665
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:14,207
The evidence
of the wire transfer;

666
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,510
the money that you paid
the Triad to assassinate him.

667
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:18,379
The money I--

668
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,583
Moira!

669
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:23,952
Oh!

670
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:27,489
Mr. Merlyn thanks you
for your loyalty.

671
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,358
You've done well.

672
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,593
Now Chen's family
will share his fate.

673
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:33,896
Chen betrayed us,

674
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:35,898
but his daughter didn't.

675
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,401
Tell Mr. Merlyn
I want her to live.

676
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:40,437
Amanda nearly lost her
life in the Glades,

677
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:43,172
now she's lost her father. I think
she's suffered enough.

678
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,941
We must send a message.

679
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:47,643
We have.

680
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:49,444
We...

681
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:53,448
- Very well.
- Thank you--

682
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:24,614
Thea's friend is upstairs.
I saw.

683
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:27,383
You probably saw that they were
very happy to see each other,

684
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,985
if you know what I mean.

685
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:32,122
Which you probably don't
want to talk about,

686
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:34,791
because she's
your baby sister.

687
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:38,562
You ok?

688
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:40,197
I'm getting there.

689
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,232
Thank you.

690
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:45,535
Psst.

691
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:48,238
By the way.

692
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,842
If you ever need to tell
someone about your day...

693
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:56,512
You can tell me.

694
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:09,226
What's that?

695
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,294
Felicity pulled it up.
It's an old map

696
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:13,096
of a decommissioned
subway line.

697
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,331
Runs underneath
the low rent district of the city.

698
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,340
I've seen that map before.

699
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,545
It was right in front
of our faces

700
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:30,746
the entire time.

701
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:32,681
My father, the other archer,

702
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:36,452
the undertaking,
whatever the plan is.

703
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:39,855
It's all connected
to the Glades.
