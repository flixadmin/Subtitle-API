1
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,590
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,450
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,680
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
Stay close.

5
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,390
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
Get on his back.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Hurry up.

8
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,650
Whoa!

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,320
Ow!

10
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,430
Whoa!

11
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,760
There he is.
Go get him.

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,330
Oh, you'll pay
for that.

13
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,720
No. No, please.

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,660
Please, no.

15
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,750
Hold it there.

16
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
I only got one...

17
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,940
but he's a fine specimen.

18
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,680
- That's all?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,410
That shroom bit me twice.

20
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,580
Huh.

21
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,890
Tomb Bloom.

22
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,880
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

23
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,350
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,</i>

24
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,280
<i>for you may
remember this story...</i>

25
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,590
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

26
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,000
<i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil</i>

27
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,670
<i>and protector of the Moors...</i>

28
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,840
<i>was still hated
after all this time.</i>

29
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,810
<i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...</i>

30
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,910
<i>but that was before
she found light</i>

31
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,810
<i>in the heart
of a human child...</i>

32
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,750
<i>and raised the girl
as her own.</i>

33
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,620
<i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love</i>

34
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,690
<i>which broke
that very same curse.</i>

35
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,960
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

36
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,260
<i>For as the tale was told</i>

37
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,600
<i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...</i>

38
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
<i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.</i>

39
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,450
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

40
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,590
It's the big day!

41
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,720
- Come on.
- Let's go!

42
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Wake up. Wake up.

43
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,860
Come on.

44
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,670
Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!

45
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,760
Do you both remember
the secret plan?

46
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,520
I've got it
all right here.

47
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,060
When do I tell the queen
the secret?

48
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,860
You must be patient,
Thistlewit.

49
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,730
Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?

50
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,930
Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

51
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,470
I see what you did there.

52
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,020
Next item of business,
the missing fairies.

53
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,520
I've sent more sprites

54
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,620
to search
the Tomb Bloom field.

55
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,090
They'll report back to me
at nightfall.

56
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,490
We will keep searching
until we find them.

57
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,730
Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.

58
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,870
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

59
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,140
Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.

60
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,040
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

61
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,380
We must all learn
a little kindness.

62
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,520
Coming through.

63
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,950
Excuse us.

64
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,120
Official pixie business.

65
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,550
A word,
Your Majesty.

66
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,990
- Maybe two.
- Aunties...

67
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,420
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

68
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,460
- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.

69
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,790
Not for a moment.

70
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,330
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is that...?

72
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
Pinto!

73
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,040
She's come
bearing gifts.

74
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,170
The first sap
from the warming trees.

75
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,140
It's for the big day!

76
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,710
Quiet, Thistlewit.

77
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,550
What big day?

78
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Hey! My crown!

79
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm not in the mood for this.

80
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,360
Pinto!

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,100
Whoa!

82
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,140
Come on.

83
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,170
Where are you going,
aunties?

84
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,680
Whoa!

85
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,850
I don't have time
for games, Pinto.

86
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,870
What's gotten
into all of you?

87
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,540
Oh. Uh-oh!

88
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,010
There she goes,
Your Majesty.

89
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,950
Come back here.

90
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,590
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

91
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,560
Look at me.

92
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,030
Oh.

93
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,000
Philip.
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,670
I was looking for you.

95
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,640
- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.

96
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,870
I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.

97
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
The Moors have turned
to madness.

98
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,810
I've got a castle
full of complaints.

99
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,850
- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!

100
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,150
I wanted to
ask you something.

101
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,210
Yes.

102
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,820
Do you think there
could be a union

103
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,490
between Ulstead
and the Moors?

104
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,090
A union?

105
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,860
To connect both lands.

106
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,260
To bring harmony
and peace.

107
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,130
I've been imagining a bridge.

108
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,060
Oh, a bridge.

109
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,060
Yes, a bridge.

110
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,570
A union's
a wonderful idea...

111
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,470
if both sides are willing.

112
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,610
Well, I'm working
on that part.

113
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,070
He's going to blow it.

114
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,140
Give him time.
He's warming up.

115
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,250
Wait.

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,750
That's your formal coat.

117
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,620
You're in on all of this,
aren't you?

118
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,090
If you're busy,
I could always come back.

119
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,990
No. No, no.

120
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm not busy at all.

121
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,860
No, because I'd hate to...

122
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,230
Really. All ears.

123
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,570
What did you
want to talk about?

124
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,740
You're right.
He's blowing it.

125
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,610
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

126
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,840
I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.

127
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,580
I've loved you
since the moment I met you

128
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,910
and every day since.

129
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,320
If love has a truth,
here is mine.

130
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,850
There is no magic
nor curse

131
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,090
that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.

132
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,360
Are you sure
this is a good time?

133
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,690
Oh, Philip.

134
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,230
Oh, he's on his knee.

135
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,700
He took his sweet
time about it.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,570
Will you marry me?

137
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,900
Yes.

138
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,670
- Yes?
- Yes.

139
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,810
Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.

140
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,720
We're having a wedding!

141
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,330
A secret surprise wedding.

142
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,930
Of course,
we have to tell our parents.

143
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,070
Do we?

144
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,730
Mistress.

145
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,170
What?

146
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,400
I have
a little bit of news.

147
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,210
Well, on with it.

148
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,170
It's nothing
of any real consequence...

149
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,250
and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.

150
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,880
It's just that...

151
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
Prince Philip has, um...

152
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
Disappeared?

153
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,720
No.
No. Philip has...

154
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,060
Yellow fever?
No, wait!

155
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,930
Leprosy!

156
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,260
No, Mistress.

157
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,200
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

158
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,930
Don't...

159
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,040
ruin my morning.

160
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,940
Mistress, please.

161
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,880
Stay calm!

162
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,850
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

163
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,190
am I to be a best man,

164
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,290
or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?

165
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,220
General,
if that's your way

166
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,030
of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh...

167
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,100
I know
she said yes, sire.

168
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,830
What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?

169
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,430
What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?

170
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,270
"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?

171
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,270
Winged beasts,
murderous trees.

172
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,140
Guard your tongue,
General.

173
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,440
You know nothing about them.

174
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,410
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

175
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,020
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

176
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
She's not like that.

177
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
It's my job to protect
this kingdom.

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,990
And I will do so,
old friend...

179
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,390
without hesitation.

180
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,090
Walk on.

181
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,300
Open the gates!

182
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,080
Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation

183
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,420
of the Midlands have arrived.

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Weapons.

185
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,390
No. We have no need of arms.

186
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,260
Our days of war are over.

187
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,830
Ingrith...

188
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,030
you see where
I've had you placed.

189
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,030
Right behind me.

190
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,230
And that's
where I'll always be.

191
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,800
Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.

192
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,040
One can never be too careful.

193
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,150
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

194
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,080
Is it, now?

195
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
- Father, Mother.
- Well?

196
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,330
What did she say?

197
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,260
She said yes.

198
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,100
Yes!

199
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,060
That is wonderful news. Oh!

200
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,830
Two kingdoms united
at last.

201
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Yes.

202
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,380
Yes.

203
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,310
Perhaps I've
been selfish...

204
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,550
looking at this
the wrong way.

205
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,280
You've made your choice.

206
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,920
Now is a time to celebrate.

207
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm glad
you finally approve.

208
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,630
Much more than that.

209
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,400
I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms.

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,430
She shall come to dinner.

211
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
That would be incredible.

212
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,400
Under one condition.

213
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,410
She will bring her godmother.

214
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,570
Your Majesty, I strongly...

215
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,970
We will meet the one
who raised her

216
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,540
right here in this castle.

217
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,080
Yes.
The queen is right.

218
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,210
I'm not sure
her godmother will...

219
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,050
No, but I insist.

220
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,250
After all,
we will soon be family.

221
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,890
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

222
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,390
that my son
is to marry Aurora.

223
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,300
And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.

224
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,540
I shall send word
straightaway.

225
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Oh!

226
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Incoming.

227
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,460
Hold on to your petticoats!

228
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,580
Well, well.

229
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,580
So?

230
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,920
So.

231
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Godmother...

232
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,490
Philip asked me to marry him.

233
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,230
Poor thing.

234
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,960
He'll recover.

235
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,000
My answer was yes.

236
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,170
- No.
- Yes.

237
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,310
No.

238
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,570
I wasn't really asking.

239
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,640
Nor was I.

240
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,010
What's next?

241
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,550
You'll turn him into a goat?

242
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,720
Hmm.

243
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
Stop.

244
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,220
Why don't you like Philip?

245
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Well, for one thing,
he's human.

246
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,690
I'm a human.

247
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,590
And I have never
held that against you.

248
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,190
Until I fell in love.

249
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,500
Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.

250
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,170
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

251
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,740
A very handsome
and charming prince.

252
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,680
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

253
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,750
Please give him a chance.

254
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,580
Let us prove you wrong.

255
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,650
Philip is thoughtful...

256
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,320
he's very kind...

257
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,460
Kind of what?

258
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,620
The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...

259
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,760
and they have invited
both of us to the castle.

260
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,100
You want me
to meet his parents?

261
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,200
It's just a dinner.

262
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,240
They don't want me
in Ulstead.

263
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,440
Why on earth would I go?

264
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.

265
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,280
Please.

266
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,590
Philip.

267
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,190
I want you
to wear this tonight.

268
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,830
Your sword?

269
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,860
Because of you,

270
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,530
Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.

271
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,670
Father,
my love for Aurora

272
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,440
has nothing to do
with politics.

273
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,770
Yes, but your love...

274
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,710
will ensure peace
for generations.

275
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,310
Now take it.
And wear it...

276
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,280
to know that you will
never have to use it.

277
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,390
Oh, my son.

278
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,260
I've never been more proud.

279
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,430
And what about Mother?

280
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,430
Is she okay with this?

281
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,540
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

282
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,690
Oh.

283
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,800
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

284
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,480
Oh.

285
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,350
I'm losing my patience.

286
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,410
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,220
You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.

288
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,220
Aurora said yes.

290
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,360
It's all coming together...

291
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,130
perfectly.

292
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,810
Hello.

293
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,580
Hello.

294
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,250
Hello.

295
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,190
Try it with
a little less fang.

296
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,290
How's this?

297
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,830
Try the greeting.

298
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,570
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

299
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,440
Remember,
it's not a threat.

300
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

301
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,440
- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.

302
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,450
Try it with a curtsy.

303
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,380
We can skip that part.

304
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,260
She really loves that boy,
you know.

305
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,800
You're doing her
a great kindness.

306
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,530
Kindness?

307
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,630
Mistress...

308
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,350
Doesn't she look lovely?

309
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,550
I have something for you.

310
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Hmm?

311
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,330
For your horns.

312
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,660
I just thought
it might make

313
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,500
Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

314
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,270
And you, as well.

315
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,970
Maybe it's a bad idea.

316
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,610
No, it's...

317
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,610
It's all right.

318
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,820
I'm so excited.

319
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,990
Mmm... It's more
than I can bear.

320
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,500
It's Maleficent!

321
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,100
Pitchforks?

322
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,570
- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.

323
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,550
- It's getting better.
- Hmm.

324
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,460
Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.

325
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,530
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,040
They're here.

327
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,650
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

328
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,950
I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.

329
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,520
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

330
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,120
Why are we
talking about bears?

331
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,800
Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.

332
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,070
Thank you.

333
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,440
You look wonderful.

334
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,910
I'm so happy
to be here.

335
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,480
Aurora, this is
truly an honor.

336
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,420
Welcome to Ulstead.

337
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,990
Such a beautiful girl.

338
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,560
I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.

339
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,930
Your Majesty.

340
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,770
The flowers
in your hair.

341
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,570
I'm allergic.

342
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,870
I'm so sorry.

343
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,070
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.

344
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
They're beautiful.

345
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,610
Presenting Maleficent.

346
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,920
Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.

347
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,560
This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.

348
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,470
And my mother,
Queen Ingrith.

349
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,870
Welcome to our home.

350
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,980
It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

351
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,110
Don't smile.

352
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,750
And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

353
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,520
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

354
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,220
Why would I have trouble?

355
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
Shoo!

356
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,260
He's making small talk.

357
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,470
I'll explain it later.

358
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,600
No trouble at all.

359
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,670
Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,200
dinner is served.

361
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,570
Please, make yourselves
at home.

362
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Hmm.

363
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,770
Bird.

364
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,270
Delicious.

365
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,590
Is there a problem?

366
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,120
It's iron.

367
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,760
Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,

368
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,060
she is averse to iron.

369
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,690
I had no idea.

370
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,070
Take it away at once.

371
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,240
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

372
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,880
Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?

373
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,280
It certainly is.

374
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,980
Shoo!

375
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,920
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

376
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,190
to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?

377
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,930
Oh, I simply can't wait

378
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,640
to have a little one running
through the castle again.

379
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,010
This castle?

380
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,310
Yes, of course.

381
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,150
This will be their home.

382
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,820
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

383
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,820
Yes, sir, I do.

384
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,290
Yes...

385
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,130
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

386
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,030
- I made her queen.
- Her castle is

387
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,430
quite stunning.
You must see it.

388
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,370
Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.

389
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,070
Does she not?

390
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,670
Mother...

391
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,770
One in the Moors,

392
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,740
and one left behind
by her father.

393
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,350
King Stefan,
was it not?

394
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,650
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

395
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,420
So, you're also
a true princess.

396
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,820
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

397
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,660
Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?

398
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,760
Both.

399
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,870
Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.

400
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,870
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

401
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,910
A baby cursed to sleep...

402
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,110
and never wake up.

403
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,910
Really?

404
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,310
Who would do
such a terrible thing

405
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,380
to an innocent child?

406
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,990
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

407
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,490
I'm sure
your kind would agree.

408
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,260
What do you mean,
my kind?

409
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,760
She means humans.

410
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
There are fairies missing
from the Moors.

411
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,330
What I'm missing
is some wine.

412
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,230
Stolen by human poachers.

413
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,800
That's the first
I've heard of it.

414
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,070
Someone gave the order.

415
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,120
It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.

416
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,880
No, she never said that.

417
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,350
Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?

418
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
Your Majesty,
I must report

419
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,990
that two peasants
were found dead...

420
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,960
just outside the Moors.

421
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,820
They'd been missing
for several days.

422
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,360
I see.

423
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,800
Yes, we all see.

424
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,260
The borders are open,

425
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,030
but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?

426
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,900
What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?

427
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,370
Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...

428
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,140
and she's talking
about fairies.

429
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,550
Contain your animal.

430
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,450
Or I will.

431
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,390
If I didn't know better,

432
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,920
I'd say you were
making a threat.

433
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,090
Well, do you?

434
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,190
- Do I what?
- Know better?

435
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,330
Enough.

436
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,730
Put her down.

437
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,070
Please, put her down.

438
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,170
We're here to celebrate.

439
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,380
Forgive me, he's right.

440
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,480
Let's not forget
why we're here.

441
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,420
The start of a new life
for Aurora.

442
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,020
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

443
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,990
You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent...

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,030
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

445
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,530
But now...

446
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,200
Aurora will finally get...

447
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,480
the love of a real family.

448
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,970
A real mother.

449
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,340
Because the one thing
I regret...

450
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,210
is never having a daughter
of my own.

451
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
But tonight changes that.

452
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,560
Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.

453
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,240
Guards!

454
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,340
We have opened our home
to a witch!

455
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,990
Stop!

456
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,490
There is no union.

457
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,190
There will be no wedding.

458
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,060
- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!

459
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,890
Maleficent, please, stop now.

460
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,170
John, I'm so frightened.

461
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,630
Ah!

462
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,930
What has she done to me?

463
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Father!

464
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,270
John!

465
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,210
We go home.

466
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
John!

467
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,250
It's a curse.

468
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,520
It's a curse!

469
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,460
Maleficent has cursed
the king!

470
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,490
What have you done?

471
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,330
I've done nothing.

472
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,560
Aurora, we go home now.

473
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,630
Aurora!

474
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,010
Aurora!

475
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,350
Wake him!

476
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,390
Wake him, please.

477
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,210
Stand aside!

478
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,640
To the bedroom!

479
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,150
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

480
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,050
There must be a lesion.

481
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,180
Proof of her witchery.

482
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,150
Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.

483
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,360
We all saw what Maleficent
did to him.

484
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,230
I'm so sorry.

485
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,560
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

486
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,230
All he wanted was peace.

487
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
This is all my fault.

488
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,610
You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.

489
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,580
Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.

490
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,450
Especially you.

491
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,020
We'll do our best
to protect you.

492
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,220
There must be a way
to reverse this.

493
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,360
Mother, could you
try kissing him?

494
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,430
True love and all that.

495
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,600
I doubt
that would work.

496
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,130
It could save him.

497
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,770
- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.

498
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,470
Very well.

499
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,590
You wanted peace...

500
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,590
now rest in peace forever.

501
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,600
I told you.

502
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,240
This is no fairy tale.

503
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,470
I have to return
to the Moors.

504
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,640
It's the only way.

505
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,140
Wait, wait. Come here.

506
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,640
I have to find her.

507
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,780
It's the middle
of the night.

508
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,650
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

509
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,710
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

510
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,150
No. You should stay
with your family.

511
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,420
You are my family.

512
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,560
Let her go, Philip.

513
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,790
Maybe she can save him.

514
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,550
Maleficent!

515
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,720
Maleficent!

516
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,960
Godmother!

517
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,240
Please come back.

518
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,450
She's not in the Moors.

519
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,820
Diaval.

520
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320
No one's seen her.

521
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,820
I'm so happy to see you.

522
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,960
She's nowhere to be found.

523
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,460
What if she
never comes back?

524
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,730
I could be stuck
as a human forever.

525
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,430
I have to find her.

526
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,300
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

527
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,660
Tell me she's dead.

528
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,070
The iron pierced her flesh.

529
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,740
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

530
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,540
Then where is her head?

531
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,810
There was something else.

532
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,080
Another creature.

533
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,580
It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.

534
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,280
What did it look like?

535
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
Her.

536
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,660
It carried her
up into the sky.

537
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,120
Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out

538
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,630
and now she's not alone.

539
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,330
We must be ready for war.

540
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,970
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

541
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
Stay inside!

542
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,690
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

543
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,580
If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.

544
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,120
They tried to kill her
with this.

545
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,940
Do you hear it?

546
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,440
Do you hear it?

547
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Huh?

548
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,810
It's a message
from the humans.

549
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,050
I hear it loud and clear.

550
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,120
Time for us to die.

551
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,920
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

552
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,560
And we are almost extinct
because of it.

553
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,060
Killing peasants
on the Moors

554
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,860
will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.

555
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,600
They've pulled the iron
from the earth...

556
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,270
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

557
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,740
But this...

558
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,210
This will finish us.

559
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,210
Our people are safe
here for now.

560
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,910
But for how long?

561
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,820
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

562
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,720
I call for war.

563
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,920
I call for war!

564
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,220
Right now!

565
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,230
There are
too many humans.

566
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,030
Too many kingdoms.

567
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,160
Conall,
they will keep finding

568
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,100
new ways to destroy us.

569
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,770
We can't win.

570
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,040
We can't win!

571
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,810
Not this way.

572
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,250
No. You're wrong, Conall.

573
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,690
We have something
they didn't plan on.

574
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,890
We have her.

575
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,900
She holds powers
none of us possess.

576
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,670
She is wounded, Borra.

577
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,270
Who are you?

578
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,080
Hmm.

579
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,950
Hmm.

580
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,090
You reek of human.

581
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,120
Maybe I was wrong about you.

582
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,260
Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead

583
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,730
at the bottom of the sea.

584
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,870
No.

585
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,310
It's there, isn't it?

586
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,180
It's inside you.

587
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,340
Mmm.

588
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,610
Ahhh!

589
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,300
You see?

590
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,900
You see what's inside her?

591
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,270
That is what will save us all.

592
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,920
You saved me.

593
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,860
Come.

594
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,900
Let me show you who we are.

595
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,030
We're Dark Fey.

596
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,100
Same as you.

597
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,080
We're all that remain.

598
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,350
Unseen here,
far away from mankind.

599
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,080
Look!

600
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,980
As more
human kingdoms emerged,

601
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,550
we went into hiding...

602
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,120
from every corner
of the earth...

603
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,290
doing what we had to,
to survive.

604
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,030
But many were lost.

605
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,120
Only a few
generations ago...

606
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
our kind roamed
every part of the world.

607
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,190
The tundra.

608
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,560
The forest.

609
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,060
The jungle.

610
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,030
The desert.

611
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,380
Now, our only refuge
is here...

612
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,180
in this cave.

613
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,280
Our nest of origin.

614
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,190
Listen.
Play in the wind.

615
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,990
Go!

616
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,380
Those children
should be soaring

617
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,550
over the trees and rivers.

618
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,480
Instead,
they are raised in exile.

619
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,550
I could protect them.

620
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,220
How? By waging war
against the humans?

621
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,290
I've been at war with them
my whole life.

622
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,290
Not all of them.

623
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,560
There was one you raised
as your own.

624
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,170
Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.

625
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,230
Maybe we can exist
without fear...

626
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,440
and war.

627
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,940
Find a way together.

628
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,340
That will never happen.

629
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,010
Oh.

630
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,230
Whoa.

631
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,270
Whoa!

632
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,590
Ow! Oh.

633
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
Huh?

634
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,470
Gotcha!

635
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,610
Welcome to your new home.

636
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,170
We've been worried
about you, dear.

637
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Your Majesty.

638
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,200
I couldn't find her.

639
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,710
My heart breaks for you.

640
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,210
She has brought
a cloud of darkness

641
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,280
upon your happiness.

642
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,380
I know she was
against this marriage.

643
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,720
Never trusted your
instincts as a queen.

644
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,360
When I saw her at dinner...

645
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,430
with her horns covered...

646
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,530
bent cowering...

647
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:16,040
Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.

648
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,170
I just don't know
what to do.

649
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,080
You do truly love him,
don't you?

650
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,410
My son.

651
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,010
Deeply.

652
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,750
It is love
that will heal you.

653
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,120
It's what heals us all.

654
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,320
Let's move
forward together...

655
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,760
as a family.

656
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,280
<i>To all who live
on the Moors...</i>

657
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,420
What is that noise?

658
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,180
<i>...and kingdoms
far and wide,</i>

659
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,520
<i>the king and queen
invite you...</i>

660
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,190
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

661
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,160
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

662
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,590
<i>All are welcome.</i>

663
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
Huh?

664
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,270
<i>And all are expected!</i>

665
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,200
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

666
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,410
I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!

667
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,610
I always knew
I'd be invited.

668
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,540
Just glad you two
made the cut.

669
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,380
Who's getting married?

670
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,430
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

671
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
The queen is right.

672
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,530
We owe it to everyone...

673
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,700
especially the king.

674
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,570
What about Maleficent?

675
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,780
She's gone.

676
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,250
The Phoenix.

677
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,530
It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...

678
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,860
evolved over centuries.

679
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,130
You are the last
of her descendants.

680
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,270
Her blood is your own.

681
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,610
You are her.

682
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,510
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

683
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:40,350
destruction and rebirth.

684
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,220
But nature's greatest power

685
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,360
is the power
of true transformation.

686
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,400
You transformed
when you raised Aurora.

687
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,600
When you found love...

688
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,670
in the middle of your pain.

689
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,940
I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...

690
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,510
all of your pain...

691
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,640
and not use it.

692
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,880
Help us broker peace
with the humans.

693
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,690
Because peace...

694
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,290
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

695
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,800
The Moors are our last
true nature on earth.

696
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,910
And yet you named
a human as queen.

697
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,610
A daughter you cared for.

698
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,810
I have no daughter.

699
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,820
She has chosen her side.

700
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,500
We've just heard.

701
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,270
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

702
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,540
Humans will come
from all over.

703
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,540
That's when we attack.

704
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,480
We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead...

705
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,480
and their young prince.

706
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,850
Their kingdom will fall.

707
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,520
And the Fey will rise again.

708
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,910
The fairies made it.

709
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,560
I wore it when I
married the king.

710
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm sure it's perfect.

711
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,000
So am I.

712
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,840
Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.

713
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,650
Considering
how she was raised.

714
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,620
By the same evil witch
who cursed her.

715
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,520
It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along.

716
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,650
It's a miracle

717
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,490
the poor child is
alive at all.

718
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,790
Thank you so much.

719
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,660
It's exquisite.

720
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,060
<i>When I'm older...</i>

721
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,900
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

722
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,500
Then we can
look after each other.

723
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,690
- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.

724
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,490
Aurora, I know you
better than that.

725
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,530
This jewelry...

726
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,860
my hair...

727
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,000
all these rules.

728
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,740
I can't breathe.

729
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,710
I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.

730
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,010
I feel like
a different person.

731
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,880
Listen...

732
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,510
I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.

733
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,050
You don't have to change.

734
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,150
I don't want you to change.

735
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,600
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

736
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,020
Ah, yes.

737
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
Well...

738
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,220
Does it work?

739
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,020
I only have a handful

740
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,990
of fairy specimens
to work with...

741
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:52,760
and the extraction process
is painstaking.

742
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,530
Extraction from what?

743
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,770
Tomb Bloom flowers.

744
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,000
They grow from
a fairy's grave,

745
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,770
contain their very essence.

746
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,770
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

747
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,740
the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.

748
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,240
We will need thousands more.

749
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,580
Show me.

750
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,020
Show me.

751
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,020
Very well.

752
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,250
So...

753
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,180
Finally,
the Moors will be mine.

754
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,980
No more fairies.

755
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,180
Stay alert, men.

756
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,030
Wow!

757
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,200
This is where
I found them.

758
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,870
Excellent.

759
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,700
But what if
the winged one returns?

760
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,640
Don't you worry about that.

761
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,710
We'll be ready.

762
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,850
Take the Tomb Blooms.

763
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,450
Get to work!

764
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,260
Sentries, stay alert!

765
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,730
Keep your weapons on hand.

766
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,750
Move it!

767
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,060
Maleficent...

768
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,010
This is where
we bury our dead.

769
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,150
They've destroyed it.

770
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,250
This is what
the humans do.

771
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,790
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

772
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,320
We have to stop them.

773
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,260
You spent years
caring for a human...

774
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,270
now it's time
to care for your own.

775
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,940
Fire!

776
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,230
Reload! We go again!

777
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,540
Fire!

778
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,810
Reload!
There's another one!

779
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,620
Everyone, stay together!

780
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,490
We're about to leave
the Moors.

781
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,190
Grab the hand or the wing...

782
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,500
or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.

783
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,210
Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!

784
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,280
Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.

785
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,110
- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.

786
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,280
I'm with the bride.

787
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,350
We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind

788
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,480
find their seats first.

789
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,690
But I'm not a human.

790
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,620
- I'm a raven.
- What?

791
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,390
A raven. The black bird.

792
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,660
Mmm. This rice is delicious.

793
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,230
You're supposed
to throw it

794
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,430
at the bride and groom.

795
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:43,100
What? And waste good rice?

796
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,200
What's the hold up?

797
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,440
Let me in!

798
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,410
Why can't humans come in, too?

799
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,610
Why can't we come in?

800
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,210
I know it's bad luck...

801
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,950
but I had to see you.

802
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,750
For you.

803
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,620
A Tomb Bloom?

804
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,690
Where did you get this?

805
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,460
From my mother.

806
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,200
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

807
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,070
<i>From my mother.</i>

808
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:12,940
Where should we sit, Flittle?

809
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,980
On the left.
We're with the bride.

810
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,710
Yes, we are.

811
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,580
But the groom's lovely, too.

812
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,380
Mmm. Yes, he is.

813
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,950
I'm with both.

814
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,190
Huh?

815
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,660
Now.

816
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,920
What's this?

817
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,790
Nobody is allowed in here
except me.

818
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,590
And I'm already here,
so go away!

819
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,350
Maleficent, please stop.

820
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,290
Maleficent.

821
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,620
She didn't do it.

822
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,400
Get out!

823
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,360
Before I call the guards!

824
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,800
The missing fairies.

825
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,340
I said get out.
Did you hear me?

826
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,980
What have you done?

827
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,010
You're a pixie.

828
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,580
How dare you call me that?

829
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,690
I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...

830
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:05,490
and I serve the queen.

831
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,460
She took your wings.

832
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,000
We have to release them.

833
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,800
They belong on the Moors.

834
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,870
As you do, Aurora.

835
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,440
A human who has betrayed
her kind.

836
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,980
You put the curse
on the king.

837
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,050
Oh, dear.

838
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,650
You may be queen...

839
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,450
but you are very young.

840
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,560
Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated...

841
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,430
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

842
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,330
When I was young...

843
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,570
my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.

844
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,910
And one particularly
harsh winter...

845
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,740
our crops died...

846
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,480
and the people
began to suffer.

847
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,080
And as we looked
over our walls...

848
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,450
we could see
the fairies thriving.

849
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,390
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

850
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:18,500
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

851
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:21,460
Choosing peace
over our people,

852
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,800
he sent my brother
to do his bidding.

853
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,900
He never came back.

854
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,000
Those savages...

855
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,640
creatures who could
barely grunt,

856
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,010
let alone engage in talks,
killed him.

857
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,410
I don't believe that.

858
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:36,780
Our people became fearful.

859
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,610
They overthrew my father.

860
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,480
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

861
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:48,420
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

862
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,160
Another weak king

863
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,890
speaking of
tolerance and civility.

864
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,500
And now, my own son...

865
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,500
corrupted with visions
of harmony.

866
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,870
But peace
will not be our downfall.

867
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,780
Now lock her up.

868
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,880
A war is coming.

869
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,690
No! No!

870
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,570
I wish you could be here
with me.

871
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,140
Conall wanted peace...

872
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:46,120
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

873
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,020
Now, we will have our war.

874
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,260
Our fight begins now!

875
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:58,060
We will rise together!

876
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,630
We fight together.

877
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:05,000
And we will show them
no mercy!

878
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,050
Come on! Go!

879
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,530
Go! Go!

880
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,030
Go! Go! Go!

881
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,880
Where are all Philip's guests?

882
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,050
- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.

883
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,010
Start the music.

884
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:40,600
Come on! Come on!

885
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,660
She's gone.

886
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,200
Hey!

887
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:01,110
It's a trap! Get down!

888
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,230
Your Majesty...

889
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:24,830
they're coming from the sea.

890
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,710
She escaped!

891
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,150
Down this way, come on!

892
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,290
Your Highness.

893
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,830
Upon my command.

894
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:07,040
Check every room!

895
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,110
She can't be far!

896
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,080
Wait.

897
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,780
Wait.

898
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:12,110
What's going on?

899
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,850
Now.

900
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,950
Fire!

901
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,520
No!

902
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,320
They look just like her.

903
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,100
Withdraw!

904
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,960
Pull back!

905
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,400
Maleficent's
starting a war.

906
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,870
First my father,
and now this.

907
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,140
Philip!
She didn't curse him.

908
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,240
- Maleficent.
- What?

909
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,010
She never cursed him.

910
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:21,940
It was your mother.

911
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,240
What are you saying?

912
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,420
It was the spindle.

913
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,550
The curse is still in it.

914
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,260
Your mother used it
against your father.

915
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,390
Look.

916
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,600
It's the same.

917
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,370
She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel.

918
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,670
This isn't a wedding.

919
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,870
It's a trap.

920
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,980
Remember where
you came from.

921
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,950
Remember who you are.

922
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,090
I've made my choice.

923
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:06,190
You'll have to make yours.

924
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,050
Stay low!

925
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,390
Divide!

926
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,230
Follow me!

927
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,240
Attack!

928
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,200
Attack!

929
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,990
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

930
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,260
No!

931
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,080
Aunties! Aunties!

932
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,510
It's too heavy!

933
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,280
Aurora!

934
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,450
Diaval! You're here.

935
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:19,460
Oh, what's happening?

936
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,280
Weapon change!

937
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,380
Weapon change! Go!

938
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:25,690
Mother!

939
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,260
You have to stop this.

940
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,760
We are at war.

941
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,790
This isn't a war.
It's a massacre.

942
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,530
Philip,
you don't understand.

943
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:36,400
These creatures stand
between us...

944
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,200
and everything
we need to survive.

945
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,540
You're wrong.

946
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,170
We can stand together.

947
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:44,870
Well, you're a fool
to believe that.

948
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,310
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

949
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:50,480
You lied to me.

950
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,620
I am protecting the kingdom...

951
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,350
and your throne.

952
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,520
What about Father?

953
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,260
Were you protecting him, too?

954
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,860
The prince
is not feeling well.

955
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,900
See him to his chambers.

956
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,770
Now.

957
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,540
Sire, stop!

958
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,870
Yield! Yield!

959
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:50,940
My mother cursed the king

960
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,240
so she could destroy
the Moor folk.

961
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,380
Your men are paying
heavily for it.

962
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,720
We have to do something!

963
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,620
Goodbye, girls.

964
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,930
No, come back!

965
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,730
Flittle! No!

966
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:27,780
No!

967
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,650
Hey, you,
stay with your own!

968
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:31,910
Run, Aurora, run!

969
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,720
Let him go!

970
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,420
No! No!

971
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,420
Godmother.

972
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:09,440
For Flittle!

973
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,360
We've got her!

974
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:35,940
Huh?

975
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,900
Go! Go!

976
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,640
This way! This way!

977
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,640
Go!

978
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:57,150
Stand down!

979
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:01,160
This is not my fight.

980
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,790
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

981
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,530
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

982
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,690
There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.

983
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,670
This way!
This way!

984
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:56,650
Maleficent's back!

985
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,750
She's going for the queen.

986
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,560
Yield! Yield!

987
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,690
Stand down!

988
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,960
Lower your weapons!

989
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:29,050
There's the evil
that I promised them.

990
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,220
Your kind is more predictable
than humans.

991
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,860
Stop!

992
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,830
Stop!

993
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:46,930
Well, almost.

994
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,560
Stop.

995
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,830
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

996
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,800
There's another way.

997
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,970
I know who you are.

998
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:59,880
I know you.

999
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,980
You do not.

1000
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,620
Yes, I do.

1001
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,950
You're my mother.

1002
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,290
No!

1003
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,710
Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?

1004
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:08,140
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

1005
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:09,410
and then use that fear...

1006
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,610
Your Majesty.

1007
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,320
...against your enemies.

1008
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,090
So...

1009
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,690
I spread the story
of the evil witch...

1010
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:24,190
and the princess she cursed.

1011
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:28,000
It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.

1012
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,000
They were all terrified.

1013
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,100
And the story became legend.

1014
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:39,070
I know you think
I'm a monster.

1015
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,050
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

1016
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,980
I did for Ulstead.

1017
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:50,750
You are a traitor
to your kind,

1018
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,360
and you will pay for it.

1019
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:55,690
Maleficent is dead!

1020
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,860
We will never again
live in fear!

1021
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,270
Get back here!

1022
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:09,440
Ulstead is free at last!

1023
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,280
Let me go!

1024
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:22,050
What's happening?

1025
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,490
Well, well.

1026
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,600
Hello, Beasty.

1027
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:12,350
I missed you.

1028
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:15,550
Did you bump
your head, then?

1029
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,350
I did.

1030
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:21,530
Philip.

1031
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,430
Yes?

1032
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:27,160
Do you love my daughter?

1033
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,400
With everything I have.

1034
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,940
Good.

1035
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,660
I believe this belongs to you.

1036
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,600
Curses don't end.

1037
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,370
They're broken.

1038
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,500
It ends.

1039
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:40,170
There will be
no more fighting.

1040
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,740
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

1041
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,170
And from this day on...

1042
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:47,510
we move forward...

1043
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,980
and find our way...

1044
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,380
in peace.

1045
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,350
Together.

1046
01:41:57,620 --> 01:42:00,420
Today,
there will be a wedding.

1047
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:03,830
Not just a union
of two people...

1048
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:07,160
but a union of two kingdoms.

1049
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,570
And all are invited...

1050
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,730
all are safe...

1051
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,170
and all are welcome.

1052
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,040
Hello, there.

1053
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:33,920
We cannot live
amongst monsters...

1054
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,560
Someone should
really cover those horns.

1055
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:01,410
If only Conall could see you.

1056
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:04,550
Borra...

1057
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,350
it's time to come home.

1058
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,760
Hello.

1059
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:20,400
Can you come here?

1060
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:31,880
Yes?

1061
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,650
Will you give me away?

1062
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:37,510
Never.

1063
01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:40,620
No.

1064
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,180
Will you walk me
down the aisle?

1065
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,350
Ah.

1066
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:47,690
Yes.

1067
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:13,320
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

1068
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:26,630
Is that...?

1069
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,330
She can change her back.

1070
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,430
I suppose.

1071
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,600
Only if we wanted to.

1072
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,270
Father.

1073
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,050
I'm so glad to see you.

1074
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:46,410
I've dreamed
of this moment.

1075
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:49,320
Two kingdoms
united at last.

1076
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,050
And it's because of you.

1077
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,990
I'm so proud of you.
So proud.

1078
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,520
She looks better
in green.

1079
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,620
Pink, you mean.

1080
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:30,990
No, in green.

1081
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:32,790
Pink.

1082
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,030
- Green.
- Pink.

1083
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,800
Flittle!

1084
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,040
It's perfect.

1085
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,380
Let her go.

1086
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,700
Pull yourself together.

1087
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,900
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1088
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,610
divided by fear.

1089
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:51,540
Today, you teach us

1090
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:54,680
we are not defined
by where we are from...

1091
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,850
but by whom we love.

1092
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,550
The bands, please.

1093
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:17,970
Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...

1094
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:18,770
I do.

1095
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:21,900
And do you,
Aurora, take...

1096
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,610
I do.

1097
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:27,480
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1098
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,510
You may kiss the bride.

1099
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,240
You're smiling.

1100
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:25,870
It's a new day.

1101
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,040
It is.

1102
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,750
Morning.

1103
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:45,850
Will you stay awhile?

1104
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,590
A little while.

1105
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:49,620
But don't worry...

1106
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:52,030
I'll see you
at the christening.

1107
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:10,110
