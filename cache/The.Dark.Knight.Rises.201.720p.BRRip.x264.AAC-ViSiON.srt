1
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,562
I knew Harvey Dent.

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,898
I was his friend.

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:14,239
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,577
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,432
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,642
He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,854
- You don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

8
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,023
Don't worry, no charge for them.

9
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,985
- And why would I want them?
- They were trying to grab your prize.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,821
They work for the mercenary.

11
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,864
The masked man.

12
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,909
- Bane?
- Aye.

13
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,662
Get them onboard. I'll call it in.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,589
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

15
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,969
lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,346
but only one of you!

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,645
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,239
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

19
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,371
He didn't fly so good!

20
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,540
Who wants to try next?

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,126
Tell me about Bane!

22
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,794
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,966
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,803
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,098
before throwing him out of a plane.

26
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,770
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,063
Who are you?

28
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,691
It doesn't matter who we are.

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,319
What matters is our plan.

30
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,078
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

31
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,665
If I pull that off, will you die?

32
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,001
It would be extremely painful.

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,336
You're a big guy.

34
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,712
For you.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,885
Was getting caught part of your plan?

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,553
Of course.

37
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,020
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

38
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,690
- We had to find out what he told you...
- Nothing. I said nothing.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,624
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,211
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

41
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,797
Crashing this plane...

42
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,637
with no survivors.

43
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,036
Mayday, Mayday!

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,461
What you doing to me? Let me out!

45
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,798
No!

46
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,092
No, no, no! No!

47
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,565
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

48
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,194
Have we started the fire?

49
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,947
Yes, the fire rises.

50
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,460
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

51
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,837
That comes later.

52
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,243
Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday...

53
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,454
but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.

54
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,750
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...

55
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,046
had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

56
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,383
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

57
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:11,888
No city is without crime, but this city is
without organized crime because the Dent Act...

58
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,267
gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

59
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,104
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

60
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,274
and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

61
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,528
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

62
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,824
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

63
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,743
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

64
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,371
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

65
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,248
No one has. Not in years.

66
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,294
People put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

67
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,006
A thug who showed his true nature...

68
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,633
when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

69
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,303
and murdered him in cold blood.

70
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,389
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

71
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,558
- Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

72
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,187
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

73
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,813
Commissioner Gordon.

74
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,616
The truth?

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,830
I have...

76
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,750
written a speech...

77
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,754
telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

78
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,886
Maybe the time isn't right.

79
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,267
Maybe right now...

80
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,062
all you need to know
is that there are...

81
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,025
1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

82
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,113
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

83
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,202
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

84
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,707
It has not been for nothing.

85
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,712
- You see the guy who owns the house?
- No. I heard...

86
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,840
- He never leaves the east wing.
- I heard he had an accident.

87
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,761
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a...
- Mr. Till?

88
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,640
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

89
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,142
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

90
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,020
She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

91
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,397
The east drawing room.

92
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,569
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

93
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,992
I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.

94
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,160
And you mustn't take it personally.

95
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,331
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...

96
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,166
peeing into Mason jars.

97
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,711
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

98
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,393
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

99
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,273
who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

100
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,692
He can't get your money back. I can.

101
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,864
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...

102
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

103
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,786
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...

104
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,914
so why waste my time indeed?

105
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,958
Second shift reports in?

106
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,210
You should spend more time
with the mayor.

107
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,254
Well, that's your department.

108
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,049
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

109
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,510
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

110
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,556
- Must be popular with his wife.
- Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

111
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,935
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

112
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,646
Really?

113
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,691
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

114
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,225
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

115
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,354
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

116
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,195
Although you don't have the long nails
or, the facial scars, sir.

117
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,198
Is that what they say about me?

118
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,451
It's just that no one ever sees you.

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,831
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

120
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,084
It can't be the same one...

121
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,754
because her pearls are in this safe...

122
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,092
the manufacturer clearly explained...

123
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,596
is uncrackable.

124
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,603
Oops.

125
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,981
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,152
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

127
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,281
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

128
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,161
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

129
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,501
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

130
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,059
Can I have a ride?

131
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,728
You read my mind.

132
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,063
Let's go.

133
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,858
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

134
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,651
She's very persistent.

135
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,154
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

136
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,490
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

137
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,951
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

138
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,079
And this is your idea
of sounding the alarm, is it?

139
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,415
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

140
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,875
- She?
- One of the maids.

141
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,669
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.

142
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,297
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

143
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,384
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

144
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,720
She was.

145
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,060
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

146
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,105
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

147
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,441
That's a job for the police?

148
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,444
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

149
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,406
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down
overdue library books.

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,329
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

151
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,542
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

152
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,502
You have something you want to ask me?

153
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,091
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

154
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,218
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

155
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,471
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

156
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,392
breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

157
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,186
I'm not hearing a question, son.

158
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,313
Don't you want to know who he was?

159
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,608
I know exactly who he was.

160
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,571
He was the Batman.

161
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,534
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

162
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,836
Master Wayne?

163
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,590
Master Wayne?

164
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,831
You haven't been down here in a long time.

165
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,543
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

166
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,503
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

167
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,132
she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

168
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,425
She's good.

169
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,137
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

170
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,932
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

171
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,685
with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and...

172
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,938
Selina Kyle.

173
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,943
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

174
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,113
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

175
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,033
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

176
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,410
She won't. She likes them too much.

177
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,371
And they weren't what she was after.

178
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,623
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

179
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,793
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

180
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,545
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

181
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,548
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

182
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,009
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

183
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,639
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

184
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,058
There's nothing out there for me.

185
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,810
And that's the problem.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,521
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

187
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,982
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

188
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,525
Alfred...

189
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,319
I did find someone.

190
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,904
I know, and you lost them.

191
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,031
But that's all part of living, sir.

192
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,327
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

193
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,996
Remember when you left Gotham?

194
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,165
Before all this, before Batman?

195
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,959
You were gone seven years.

196
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,714
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

197
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,509
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

198
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,928
There's this café
on the banks of the Arno.

199
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,348
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

200
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,393
I had this fantasy...

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,188
that I would look across the tables...

202
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,317
and I'd see you there, with a wife.

203
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,319
Maybe a couple of kids.

204
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,284
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

205
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,289
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

206
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,791
That you were happy.

207
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,381
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

208
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,054
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

209
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,098
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

210
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,438
I still do.

211
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,528
They wash up here
a couple of times a month.

212
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,155
More when it gets colder.

213
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,282
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

214
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,080
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

215
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,084
- What?
- Name's Jimmy.

216
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,668
He's from St. Swithin's.

217
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,215
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

218
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,719
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

219
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,388
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

220
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,392
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

221
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,645
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

222
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,897
Not for the past couple of years.

223
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,901
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

224
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,071
I'd like to, if that's all right.

225
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,282
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?

226
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,286
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.

227
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,666
Say you can live down there.

228
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,876
Say there's work down there.

229
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,545
Work?

230
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,506
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

231
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,300
More than you can find up here, I guess.

232
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,427
So you know about him?

233
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,846
Of course.

234
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,349
Do you think he's coming back?

235
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,853
I don't know.

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,243
You brought a date?

237
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,621
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

238
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,750
Right hand. No partials.

239
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,132
Very nice.

240
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,010
Not so fast, handsome.

241
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,553
You got something for me?

242
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,639
Yes.

243
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,319
I don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...

244
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,280
but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

245
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,158
You don't count so good?

246
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,576
I count fine.

247
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,163
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

248
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,666
Okay.

249
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,465
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."

250
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,561
This place is a little dead.

251
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,981
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

252
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,692
Is everything okay?

253
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,861
Great. Catch you later.

254
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,870
It would have been a lot easier...

255
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,248
to just give me what we agreed.

256
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,833
We can't have loose ends.

257
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,837
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

258
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,506
No.

259
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,549
But my friend over there?

260
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,886
Every cop in the city's missing him.

261
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,388
That's cute.

262
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,266
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.

263
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,352
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

264
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,947
- Go!
- Go!

265
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,923
Police! Get down now!

266
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,344
Help me! Help me!

267
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,555
Help me, please! Please help me!

268
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,359
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

269
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,071
Call me?

270
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,327
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

271
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,708
I got the congressman.

272
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,946
Clear!

273
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,038
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

274
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,540
You three, down with me.

275
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,127
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

276
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,145
What, they went down there?

277
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,763
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

278
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,183
- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in till we know what's there.

279
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,185
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

280
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,187
Someone get this hothead out of here?

281
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,857
And where's that DWP guy?

282
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,443
Why are you here?

283
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,779
Answer him.

284
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,366
I was asking you.

285
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,285
It's the police commissioner.

286
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,541
And you brought him down here?

287
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,794
- We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

288
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,298
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

289
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,591
No, he's alone.

290
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,013
Search him.

291
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,723
Then I will kill you.

292
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,172
- He's dead.
- So show me his body.

293
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,759
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

294
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,976
- Follow him!
- Follow him?

295
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,535
You okay? You okay?

296
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,620
Hey, hey, you awake?

297
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,878
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

298
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,506
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

299
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,466
Even from a police officer.

300
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:38,304
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

301
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,681
That still count as unscheduled?

302
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,895
What can I do for you, officer?

303
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,315
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

304
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,694
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

305
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,197
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

306
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,199
A masked man called Bane.

307
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,369
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

308
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,623
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

309
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,791
He needs you.

310
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,669
He needs the Batman.

311
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,216
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

312
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,969
But we've met before.

313
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:24,224
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
St. Swithin's.

314
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,604
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

315
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,692
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

316
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,490
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

317
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,993
and I remember that one just fine.

318
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,247
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

319
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,375
To be angry...

320
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,960
in your bones.

321
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,674
I mean, they understand.

322
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,676
Foster parents.

323
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,844
Everybody understands...

324
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,638
for a while.

325
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,101
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

326
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,769
Move on.

327
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,313
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

328
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,357
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

329
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,528
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

330
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,572
Practice smiling in a mirror.

331
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,909
It's like putting on a mask.

332
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,706
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

333
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,708
Pretty girl on your arm.

334
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,585
We were so excited.

335
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,463
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

336
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,676
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

337
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,638
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

338
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,517
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

339
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,771
I'd seen that look on your face before.

340
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,941
It's the same one I taught myself.

341
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,779
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

342
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,699
but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

343
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,201
even if you're not.

344
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,834
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

345
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,753
Because the money stopped.

346
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,132
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

347
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,385
Some of those details
might need your help.

348
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,513
You check that name? Bane?

349
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,349
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

350
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,977
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

351
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,648
that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

352
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,152
- Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

353
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,364
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

354
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,789
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

355
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:57,044
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

356
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,921
There have to be some.

357
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,424
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

358
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,595
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

359
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,639
Yes. One or two.

360
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,808
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

361
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,727
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

362
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,901
- I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

363
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,570
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

364
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,074
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

365
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,618
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

366
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,454
the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

367
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,290
and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

368
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,377
- I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

369
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,353
We were in this together...

370
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,023
then you were gone.

371
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,317
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

372
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,612
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

373
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:13,120
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

374
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,791
The Batman has to come back.

375
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,419
What if he doesn't exist anymore?

376
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,047
He must.

377
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,605
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

378
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,649
- You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I...

379
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,569
- Get out.
- She took my...

380
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,322
- Now.
- Creep!

381
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,408
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

382
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,327
Probably the watch.

383
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,635
Who's that?

384
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,929
A stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car.

385
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,222
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

386
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,647
- I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here.

387
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,315
Thank you so much.

388
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,366
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

389
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,285
Miss Tate, isn't it?

390
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,331
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

391
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,168
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

392
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,673
It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

393
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,592
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,933
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

395
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,726
That's very generous of you.

396
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,814
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.

397
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,732
Take our clean-energy project.

398
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,902
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

399
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,365
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

400
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,662
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

401
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,666
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

402
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,710
that he goes into hiding.

403
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,255
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

404
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,969
Mind if I cut in?

405
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,888
Thank you.

406
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,936
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

407
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,980
I felt like some fresh air.

408
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,899
Why didn't you call the police?

409
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,902
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

410
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,365
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

411
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,493
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

412
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,371
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

413
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,458
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

414
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,420
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

415
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,630
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

416
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,885
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

417
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,180
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

418
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,184
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

419
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,063
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

420
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,901
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

421
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,903
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

422
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,364
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...

423
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,076
or you're in deep with the wrong people.

424
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,372
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

425
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,877
- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

426
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,423
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

427
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,841
Start fresh.

428
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,220
There's no fresh start in today's world.

429
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,431
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

430
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,393
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

431
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,979
Is that how you justify stealing?

432
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,732
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

433
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,193
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

434
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,402
Robin Hood?

435
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,698
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

436
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,743
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

437
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,956
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.

438
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,165
Ouch.

439
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,754
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

440
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,592
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

441
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,638
you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

442
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,891
and leave so little for the rest of us.

443
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,689
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

444
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,692
I'm adaptable.

445
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,112
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

446
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,073
But I still can't let you keep them.

447
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,916
You... You scared her off!

448
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,379
Not likely.

449
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,883
Must have lost my ticket.

450
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,802
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

451
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,270
Just you, sir?

452
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,358
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

453
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,154
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

454
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,576
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

455
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,747
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

456
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,665
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

457
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,335
Even if you have lost most of my money.

458
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,003
Actually, you did that.

459
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,881
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

460
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,967
into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

461
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,470
your company is unlikely to thrive.

462
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,679
What are my options?

463
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,224
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

464
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,935
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

465
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,062
Well, then sit tight.

466
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,939
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

467
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:18,109
while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

468
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,904
She has supported the project
all the way.

469
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,491
She's smart. And quite lovely.

470
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,536
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

471
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,039
Show her the machine.

472
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,250
I'll think it over.

473
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,751
Anything else?

474
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,170
Nope. Why?

475
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,383
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

476
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,551
I retired.

477
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,931
Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

478
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,561
Just for old times' sake.

479
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,068
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

480
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,904
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

481
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,155
All this new stuff.

482
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,952
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

483
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,788
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating...

484
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,332
all the different prototypes
under one roof.

485
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,209
- My roof.
- Why?

486
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,170
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

487
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,426
Oh, now you're just showing off.

488
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:30,223
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

489
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,312
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

490
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,272
What's it called?

491
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,110
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

492
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,655
I just took to calling it the Bat.

493
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,200
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

494
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,955
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

495
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,333
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

496
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,876
Better mind?

497
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,421
Well, I was trying to be modest.

498
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,715
A less busy mind.

499
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,425
Yours.

500
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:16,436
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

501
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,313
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

502
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,859
Not bad.

503
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,324
Not bad at all.

504
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,914
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

505
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,208
you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

506
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,417
I'm all ears.

507
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,422
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

508
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,803
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

509
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,723
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

510
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:58,103
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

511
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,397
- Bane.
- Bane.

512
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,733
Born and raised in hell on earth.

513
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,821
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

514
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,573
But they do know that once he did...

515
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,911
he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

516
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,080
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

517
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,416
And then he was excommunicated.

518
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:25,588
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

519
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,008
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

520
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,927
That was then.

521
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,180
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

522
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,933
but that doesn't make you
what you were.

523
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,729
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

524
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,858
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

525
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,152
Your resources. Your knowledge.

526
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,405
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

527
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,365
That time's past.

528
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,910
You're afraid that if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

529
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,328
No.

530
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,791
I'm afraid that you want to.

531
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,476
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

532
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,480
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

533
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,939
On what basis?

534
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,649
I flipped a coin.

535
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,699
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

536
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,079
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

537
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,046
Come on. Let's go scalping.

538
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,521
Come on.

539
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,464
Everybody down, now!

540
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,485
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

541
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,030
Really? Then why are you people here?

542
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,258
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

543
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,385
We have an emergency situation!

544
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,265
You gotta get in there!

545
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,017
This is a hostage situation.

546
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,604
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

547
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,564
I'm not risking my men for your money.

548
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,154
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

549
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,364
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

550
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,617
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

551
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,288
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in
your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.

552
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,707
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

553
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,376
- Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

554
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,086
Move back!

555
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,922
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

556
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,009
They cut the fiber.

557
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,261
Cell's working.

558
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,763
For now.

559
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,105
Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No
one gets in or out of any of these streets.

560
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,899
Where am I supposed to move it?

561
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,359
Back it up.

562
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,157
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

563
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,124
How much longer
does the program need?

564
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,877
Eight minutes.

565
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,713
Time to go mobile.

566
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,215
Everybody, up!

567
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,845
You two, move!

568
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,974
Thank you.

569
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,394
Steady.

570
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,487
Steady.

571
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,454
I've got something.

572
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,083
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

573
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,501
Hold your fire!

574
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,971
Go, go!

575
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,357
Please! Just let me go!

576
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,318
Hey, please! Hey!

577
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,740
Shoot the tires.

578
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,366
There's no shot.

579
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,912
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

580
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,832
P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...

581
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,042
in response to a hostage situation.

582
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,217
What's going on with the lights?

583
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,601
It can't be.

584
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,144
What the hell was that?

585
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,147
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

586
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,654
Please! Help, help, help!

587
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,548
Sorry.

588
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,469
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

589
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,764
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

590
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,195
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

591
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,073
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

592
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,451
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

593
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,663
Are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...

594
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,873
kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.

595
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,335
- Reports from the eyewitnesses...
- Scott, dead center of your screen.

596
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,921
- What do you see?
- I see Batman.

597
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,757
Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...

598
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,884
by what appears to be the Batman.

599
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,135
Well, what do you know?

600
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,268
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

601
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,648
Please! Just let me go! Please!

602
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,786
One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?

603
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,876
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

604
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,589
- He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

605
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,300
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

606
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,015
The entire upper west hill...

607
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,225
Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.

608
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,312
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

609
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,731
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

610
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,533
Please! Just let me go!

611
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,076
Please!

612
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,739
We lost him.

613
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,658
How could you lose him?

614
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,410
He's got a lot of firepower.

615
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,661
What, and you don't?

616
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,209
He's heading back downtown.

617
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,420
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

618
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,630
Close it off, gentlemen.

619
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,457
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

620
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,757
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.

621
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,311
You sure it was him?

622
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,571
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

623
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,364
What about the men they arrested?

624
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,619
He said, and I quote,
"They would die before talking."

625
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,122
Where does he find these guys?

626
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,459
Open the champagne.

627
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,005
And can we get some girls in here?

628
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,590
Careful what you wish for.

629
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,936
Cat got your tongue?

630
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,312
You dumb bitch.

631
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,564
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.

632
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,651
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

633
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,737
I want what you owe me.

634
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,491
Want doesn't get.

635
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:05,037
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

636
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,413
I don't know.

637
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,415
Do they?

638
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,335
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

639
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,879
The program. The "clean slate."

640
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,341
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

641
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,635
Hold it right there!

642
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,191
Where is it?

643
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,318
The clean slate?

644
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,113
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

645
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,450
in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

646
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,787
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

647
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,540
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

648
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,667
That's why I bought them.

649
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,461
But they had nothing.

650
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,589
It was a gangland myth.

651
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,101
Stay back!

652
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,106
I'm not bluffing!

653
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,400
They know.

654
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,235
They just don't care.

655
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,879
You've gotta be kidding me.

656
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,590
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

657
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,528
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.

658
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,738
This isn't a car.

659
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,456
See you around.

660
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,583
You're welcome.

661
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,335
I had it under control.

662
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,837
Those weren't street thugs.

663
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,089
They were trained killers.

664
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,924
I saved your life.

665
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,887
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

666
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,598
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

667
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,643
I sold his prints to Daggett...

668
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,064
for something that doesn't even exist.

669
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:23,068
- I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate...

670
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,571
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know...

671
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,116
but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

672
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,831
Miss Kyle?

673
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,961
So that's what that feels like.

674
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:04,818
I see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.

675
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,945
I retrieved this.

676
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,573
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

677
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,160
- They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

678
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,829
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

679
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,333
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

680
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,627
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.

681
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,172
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

682
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,134
- You thought I didn't have it in me.
- You led a bloated police force on a chase...

683
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,887
with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

684
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,890
What about when you come up
against him? What then?

685
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,853
- I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

686
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,689
I see the power of belief.

687
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,776
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

688
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,403
You said he was excommunicated.

689
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,446
By Ra's Al Ghul.

690
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,573
Who leads them now?

691
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,326
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and I beat him.

692
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,246
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

693
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,999
Trades of some kind. Coded.

694
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,628
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

695
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,879
Get this to Fox.

696
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,384
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

697
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,724
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

698
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,938
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

699
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,483
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

700
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,614
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

701
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:37,661
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

702
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,457
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

703
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:45,586
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

704
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:49,465
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

705
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:53,510
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

706
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,805
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

707
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,016
What if she had?

708
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,642
She... I can't change that.

709
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,812
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

710
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,441
saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

711
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,155
And what if...

712
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,074
to spare you pain...

713
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,786
I burnt that letter?

714
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,833
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

715
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,462
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

716
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:34,009
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

717
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,763
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

718
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,641
You expect to destroy my world...

719
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,395
and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

720
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,231
No, no, no.

721
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,567
I know what this means.

722
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:51,818
What does it mean?

723
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,404
It means your hatred.

724
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,325
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

725
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,913
since I first heard his cries echo...

726
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,666
through this house.

727
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,254
But it might also mean saving your life.

728
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,966
And that is more important.

729
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,222
Goodbye, Alfred.

730
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,201
Alfred?

731
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,001
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

732
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,712
Page three.

733
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,258
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...

734
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,718
verified by thumbprint.

735
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,554
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

736
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,767
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

737
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,354
and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

738
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,358
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

739
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,486
Applied Sciences is all locked up
and off the books.

740
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,865
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

741
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,533
Miranda Tate.

742
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,829
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

743
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,499
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

744
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,378
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

745
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,547
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

746
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,721
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

747
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,103
This is it, isn't it?

748
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,273
The reactor is beneath the river...

749
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,569
so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

750
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,198
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

751
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,659
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

752
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,460
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

753
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,295
No fossil fuels.

754
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,048
Free clean energy for an entire city.

755
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,760
Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper...

756
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,221
on weaponized fusion reactions.

757
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,309
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

758
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,187
I think this machine works.

759
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,985
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

760
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:42,239
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

761
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,200
died in a plane crash six months ago?

762
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,870
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

763
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:55,210
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

764
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,924
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

765
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,634
and this reactor.

766
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,177
To do what with it?

767
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,846
Nothing.

768
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,557
Until we can guarantee its safety.

769
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,933
And if we can't?

770
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,768
Decommission it. Flood it.

771
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,731
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

772
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,524
If the world's not ready, yes.

773
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,987
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

774
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,739
I'm trusting you.

775
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,866
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

776
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,952
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time.

777
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,163
I'm choosing to trust you.

778
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,248
Please.

779
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:44,593
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

780
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,929
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...

781
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,433
which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

782
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,852
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

783
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,771
And he himself has run it.

784
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:00,692
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.

785
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,113
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

786
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,574
it's cost us all a lot of money.

787
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,576
And he has to go.

788
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,454
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

789
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,547
Now, back to business.

790
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:26,468
- Mr. Wayne, over here!
- How's it feel to be one of the people?

791
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,680
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

792
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,142
Looks like you need a ride?

793
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,520
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

794
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:40,982
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

795
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,318
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

796
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,446
- Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

797
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,532
- Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

798
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,326
- Where is that masked...?
- Speak of the devil...

799
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,745
and he shall appear.

800
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,373
What the hell is going on?

801
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,377
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

802
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,338
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

803
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,176
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

804
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:13,473
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

805
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,562
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

806
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,525
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

807
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,277
I'm in charge.

808
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,446
Do you feel in charge?

809
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,245
I've paid you a small fortune.

810
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,373
And this gives you power over me?

811
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,375
What is this?

812
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,505
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

813
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,007
till now.

814
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,633
What are you?

815
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,635
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

816
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,680
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

817
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,852
You're pure evil.

818
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,313
I'm necessary evil.

819
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,398
No. No, no, no!

820
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,447
When you started, why the mask?

821
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,283
- To protect the people closest to me.
- But you were a loner, right?

822
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,578
- You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

823
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,665
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.

824
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,960
The idea was to be a symbol.

825
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,255
Batman could be anybody.

826
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,341
That was the point.

827
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,928
- Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

828
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:37,349
- They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

829
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,102
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

830
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,355
I could use some help, actually.

831
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,232
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

832
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,446
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

833
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,782
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

834
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,201
- That is the way...
- He's not a mark.

835
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,037
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

836
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:03,833
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.

837
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,419
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

838
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,172
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us?

839
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,301
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

840
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,096
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

841
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,932
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

842
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,351
He wants to meet tonight.

843
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,560
Why?

844
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,647
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

845
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,194
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

846
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,238
I like your place.

847
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,824
Mr. Wayne?

848
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,704
I'm sorry they took all your money.

849
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,081
No, you're not.

850
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,002
- Can we help you, officer?
- Yeah.

851
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,714
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

852
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,841
- Thought you might want to know.
- Why?

853
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:57,137
His name's all over these permits I just
pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham.

854
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:01,182
That's MTA maintenance
sewer construction, couple of other things.

855
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,352
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

856
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,397
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

857
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,733
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

858
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,236
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want him found.

859
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,739
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

860
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,658
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.

861
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,244
We could use some hotter heads
around here.

862
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,540
- Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

863
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,835
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

864
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,556
Nobody's answering.

865
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,099
No.

866
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,934
I'm on my own now.

867
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,187
Do you have keys?

868
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,564
Never needed them.

869
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,989
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

870
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,326
Suffering builds character.

871
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,918
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

872
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,421
Who's this?

873
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,597
Where's Alfred?

874
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,767
He left...

875
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,395
taking everything.

876
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,754
What's that?

877
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,841
My power's been shut off.

878
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:04,806
You're good at that.

879
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,852
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

880
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,815
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

881
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,611
I assumed your family was wealthy.

882
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,905
Not always.

883
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,449
Not when I was young.

884
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,952
An old mistake.

885
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,955
I've made a few myself.

886
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,833
More than a few.

887
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,587
We could leave.

888
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,130
Tonight.

889
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,051
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

890
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,638
Someday, perhaps.

891
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,057
Not tonight.

892
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,087
Don't be shy.

893
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,675
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

894
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,762
- That depends.
- On what?

895
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,555
On what you want it for.

896
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,642
I acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.

897
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,186
Still don't trust me?

898
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,356
How can we change that?

899
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,316
Start by taking me to Bane.

900
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,946
You asked.

901
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,283
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

902
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,078
And they're not your average brawlers.

903
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,080
Neither am I.

904
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,964
- He's behind you.
- Who?

905
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,173
Me.

906
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,305
What do you think you're...?

907
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,653
Just a little further.

908
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,413
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

909
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,999
You made a serious mistake.

910
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:41,504
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

911
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,217
Bane.

912
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,470
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

913
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,057
Mr. Wayne.

914
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,446
Peace has cost you your strength.

915
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,448
Victory has defeated you.

916
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:15,848
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

917
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,810
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

918
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,563
Members of the League of Shadows.

919
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,943
And you betrayed us.

920
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,696
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

921
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,408
by a gang of psychopaths.

922
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,790
I am the League of Shadows.

923
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,085
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

924
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,725
You fight like a younger man.

925
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:02,186
Nothing held back.

926
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:05,565
Admirable, but mistaken.

927
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,573
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

928
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,451
But you merely adopted the dark.

929
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,162
I was born in it.

930
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,873
Molded by it.

931
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:26,127
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

932
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,547
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

933
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,512
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

934
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,104
I will show you where
I have made my home...

935
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,608
whilst preparing to bring justice.

936
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,029
Then I will break you.

937
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,664
Your precious armory.

938
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,668
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

939
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:20,181
Yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

940
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,729
Your spirit...

941
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,860
or your body.

942
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:19,991
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line
on the congressman's kidnapping.

943
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,255
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

944
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,592
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

945
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,802
Do you mind?

946
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,735
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

947
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,571
Don't tell me. Still in love?

948
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,282
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

949
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,202
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

950
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,332
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

951
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,917
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.

952
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:14,128
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

953
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,172
Who then? Bane?

954
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,798
What do you know about him?

955
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:22,303
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.

956
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,347
We can offer you protection.

957
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,684
Okay.

958
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,859
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

959
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,238
Did they kill him?

960
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,617
I'm not sure.

961
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,055
Why didn't you just...

962
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,225
kill me?

963
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,853
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

964
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,148
Your punishment must be more severe.

965
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,484
Torture?

966
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,902
Yes.

967
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,738
But not of your body.

968
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,868
Of your soul.

969
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:30,454
Where am I?

970
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:32,039
Home.

971
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,918
Where I learned the truth about despair.

972
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,254
As will you.

973
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,466
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

974
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,635
Hope.

975
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,930
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...

976
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,517
has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

977
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:53,936
So easy.

978
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,105
So simple.

979
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:02,653
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

980
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,699
many have died trying.

981
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,287
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

982
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,833
So as I terrorize Gotham...

983
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,962
I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

984
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,923
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

985
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:29,054
so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

986
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,019
You can watch me torture an entire city.

987
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,315
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

988
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,568
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

989
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,157
We will destroy Gotham.

990
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,911
And then, when it is done...

991
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,996
and Gotham is...

992
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,208
ashes...

993
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,633
then you have my permission to die.

994
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,440
You're locking her up in here?

995
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:25,444
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

996
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,697
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

997
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,032
Little closer, baby.

998
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,284
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

999
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,371
She's gonna be fine.

1000
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,416
I still don't see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project.

1001
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,168
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1002
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,838
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

1003
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,883
How good of you to join us.

1004
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,220
Chair. President.

1005
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,057
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1006
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,644
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1007
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,062
No.

1008
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,730
I will volunteer.

1009
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:03,816
Where are you taking us?

1010
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:17,288
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1011
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:18,664
What happened?

1012
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,958
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1013
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,044
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1014
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,547
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1015
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,425
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!

1016
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,135
The mayor won't want panic.

1017
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,470
So it's a training exercise.

1018
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,309
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1019
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:40,144
Not you.

1020
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,688
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1021
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,568
so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.

1022
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,944
Yes, sir.

1023
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:04,835
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.

1024
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,004
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1025
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,006
Do it for the pleasure.

1026
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:12,468
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

1027
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,102
He will try the climb.

1028
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,036
Has anyone ever made it?

1029
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,413
Of course not.

1030
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,301
He says there is one who did.

1031
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,804
A child.

1032
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,099
A child born in this hell.

1033
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,601
Bane.

1034
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,896
An old legend. Nothing more.

1035
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,859
Don't.

1036
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:15,406
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

1037
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,808
Fire in the hole!

1038
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,047
Turn it on.

1039
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,597
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1040
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,223
I won't do it.

1041
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,767
All right, stop.

1042
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,229
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1043
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,190
and you'll barely slow them down.

1044
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,010
Go on, then. Do your work.

1045
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:05,140
Take them up to the surface.

1046
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,184
People of their status...

1047
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:12,606
deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1048
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:20,739
I've been to half of Daggett's cement plants
and locations they poured underground.

1049
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,283
Anything strange about the pourings?

1050
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:27,246
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1051
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:30,332
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.

1052
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:36,880
It's done.

1053
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:41,385
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1054
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,389
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1055
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,809
No, you cannot.

1056
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,813
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1057
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,067
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1058
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,403
Five, by my calculations.

1059
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,238
And then it will go off!

1060
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:06,994
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1061
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,413
indeed I hope it does.

1062
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:12,749
Hey. Hey!

1063
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,838
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1064
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:20,132
- When?
- When?

1065
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,595
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1066
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:28,307
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1067
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:32,477
And as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1068
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,240
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1069
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,291
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1070
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:59,004
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1071
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:02,758
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1072
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:06,803
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1073
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:10,182
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1074
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,651
- Patch me in to Foley.
- Foley's overseeing the operation.

1075
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,152
They're heading into a trap!

1076
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:26,031
We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.

1077
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,660
- Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1078
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:33,872
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1079
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,793
- Foley.
- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1080
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,503
Bane has been pouring concrete...

1081
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,630
- Laced with explosives!
- Where?

1082
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:51,390
Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light

1083
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,938
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...

1084
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,025
There's a ring around the tunnels! They'll
blow it and trap the cops underground!

1085
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,946
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1086
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,200
Through the perilous fight

1087
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,496
O'the ramparts we watched

1088
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:19,084
Were so gallantly streaming

1089
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,297
And the rockets' red glare

1090
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,718
The bombs bursting in air

1091
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,970
Gave proof through...

1092
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,347
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1093
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:36,643
That our flag was still there

1094
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:45,437
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave

1095
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:52,701
O'the land of the free

1096
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:59,708
And the home of the brave

1097
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,931
Let the games begin.

1098
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,301
Everybody okay?

1099
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,971
- Let's move! Move, move!
- Go, go!

1100
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,486
Gotham...

1101
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,449
take control.

1102
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,619
Take control of your city.

1103
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,710
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1104
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,795
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.

1105
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,256
Not every cop.

1106
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,398
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1107
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,535
Clear the corners, rookie.

1108
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,912
Get my coat, son.

1109
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,830
This...

1110
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,793
This is the instrument of your liberation.

1111
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,298
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1112
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,426
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1113
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,142
Identify yourself to the world.

1114
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:51,898
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1115
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,609
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1116
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:58,321
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but...

1117
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:00,448
It looks like it's him.

1118
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,994
And what...? What is this?

1119
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:08,039
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1120
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:10,584
with a blast radius of six miles.

1121
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,796
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1122
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:18,174
Only me.

1123
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,552
Only you.

1124
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,847
Thank you, good doctor!

1125
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,728
Now, this bomb is armed!

1126
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:32,480
And this bomb is mobile!

1127
01:33:32,648 --> 01:33:37,193
And the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery.

1128
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,574
For one of you holds the detonator!

1129
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:46,119
Now, we come here
not as conquerors...

1130
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:51,875
but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.

1131
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:57,797
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1132
01:33:58,507 --> 01:34:02,302
or from those people
attempting to flee...

1133
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:06,848
this anonymous Gothamite...

1134
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:11,895
this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1135
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,691
For now, martial law is in effect.

1136
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:22,197
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...

1137
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,908
and wait.

1138
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:29,079
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1139
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,003
Pull back the fighters.

1140
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:40,423
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1141
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,176
Get the president on the line.

1142
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:08,326
Tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1143
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:14,082
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.

1144
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:21,047
How many of you are there, son?

1145
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,469
You don't have enough men to stop 12
million people from leaving this island.

1146
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,681
No. No, we don't.

1147
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:30,890
But you do.

1148
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,895
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1149
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:39,065
If one person crosses this bridge...

1150
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,025
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1151
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:49,743
The people of our greatest
city are resilient.

1152
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:54,372
They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.

1153
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:59,335
We do not negotiate with terrorists...

1154
01:36:00,212 --> 01:36:02,046
but we do recognize realities.

1155
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:05,258
As this situation develops...

1156
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,928
one thing must be understood
above all others.

1157
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:14,017
People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.

1158
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,518
What does that mean?

1159
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,438
It means we're on our own.

1160
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,648
I have to get in front of a camera.

1161
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:23,359
They will kill you the second
you show your face.

1162
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,989
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people.
They need to know I could lead.

1163
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,741
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1164
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,451
Then he'll show his true colors.

1165
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,244
And you'll be dead.

1166
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:56,976
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1167
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:59,062
Blackgate Prison...

1168
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,816
where a thousand men have languished...

1169
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:06,486
under the name of this man:

1170
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,738
Harvey Dent.

1171
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,075
Who has been held up to you...

1172
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:16,746
as the shining example of justice!

1173
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,916
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera.

1174
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,045
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you...

1175
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,631
tearing down this corrupt city!

1176
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,424
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1177
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:32,220
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent.

1178
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:37,225
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1179
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,769
James Gordon:

1180
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:43,690
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent."

1181
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,775
He saved my boy...

1182
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:50,405
then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...

1183
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:53,199
so that I could, to my shame...

1184
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:56,995
build a lie around this...

1185
01:37:57,162 --> 01:37:59,873
fallen idol.

1186
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:07,088
I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.

1187
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,050
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1188
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,971
It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...

1189
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:19,225
"...and it is time for me to resign."

1190
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:23,521
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1191
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:29,527
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

1192
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,362
Of all the corrupt?

1193
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,410
Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate...

1194
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:41,831
and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1195
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,500
Gotham needed a hero.

1196
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:48,880
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1197
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:56,471
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

1198
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,515
when the rules aren't weapons anymore...

1199
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:03,686
they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1200
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,775
One day, you may face...

1201
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,610
such a moment of crisis.

1202
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,072
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did...

1203
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,911
to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

1204
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,123
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.

1205
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:29,253
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1206
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,632
The rich!

1207
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:35,510
The oppressors of generations...

1208
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:39,847
who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1209
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:43,059
And we give it back to you...

1210
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,895
the people.

1211
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,898
Gotham is yours!

1212
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:52,694
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1213
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:58,449
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1214
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:00,326
Open it!

1215
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,295
Step forward, those who would serve...

1216
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:14,632
for an army will be raised.

1217
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:23,474
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1218
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:33,693
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure!

1219
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,366
Courts will be convened.

1220
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,334
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1221
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,758
Blood will be shed!

1222
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:02,764
The police will survive...

1223
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:07,351
as they learn to serve true justice.

1224
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,980
This great city...

1225
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,650
it will endure.

1226
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:21,115
Gotham will survive!

1227
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,348
He says you must first fix your back.

1228
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:46,724
How does he know?

1229
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,309
He was the prison doctor.

1230
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:52,355
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...

1231
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,442
of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

1232
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,861
How?

1233
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:04,408
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1234
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:09,080
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1235
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,794
The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...

1236
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:17,213
left him in perpetual agony.

1237
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:20,550
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1238
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:24,053
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1239
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,513
He was born here?

1240
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:30,935
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1241
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:34,021
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.

1242
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,107
They were married in secret.

1243
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,276
When the warlord found out...

1244
01:42:38,777 --> 01:42:42,613
the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1245
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:45,449
But then he exiled him instead.

1246
01:42:45,617 --> 01:42:49,662
The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.

1247
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:54,709
But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.

1248
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:57,545
She took his place in the pit.

1249
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,216
And she was with child...

1250
01:43:02,384 --> 01:43:04,302
the mercenary's child.

1251
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:10,099
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1252
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:18,691
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1253
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:27,783
But the child had a friend...

1254
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:33,706
a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.

1255
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,583
It was to be prized.

1256
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,501
The mother was not so lucky.

1257
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:44,342
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1258
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:59,440
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.

1259
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:01,901
It has to be put back.

1260
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:09,700
Stay like this until you stand.

1261
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,630
Did you not think I would return, Bruce?

1262
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:29,929
I told you I was immortal.

1263
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,600
I watched... I watched you die.

1264
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:37,728
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1265
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,107
Once, I had a wife...

1266
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,360
my great love.

1267
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:49,115
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1268
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,121
Bane is your child.

1269
01:44:56,748 --> 01:44:57,790
Your heir.

1270
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,710
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...

1271
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:03,504
to restore balance to civilization.

1272
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:04,714
No.

1273
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:08,301
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1274
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:10,386
with all your strength...

1275
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:14,974
all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1276
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:18,728
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.

1277
01:45:19,354 --> 01:45:22,231
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1278
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:23,524
No.

1279
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,818
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1280
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,744
Yeah, just lift your head.

1281
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,579
Oh, that's good.

1282
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,461
No, no!

1283
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,165
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1284
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,250
And now it's everyone's home.

1285
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:28,089
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1286
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,995
It's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1287
01:47:00,163 --> 01:47:01,705
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1288
01:47:01,873 --> 01:47:05,209
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1289
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,170
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1290
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:09,672
It's good to see you.

1291
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:14,427
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1292
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,434
Why build yourself?

1293
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:28,732
- I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

1294
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,797
I told you it could not be done.

1295
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:35,591
You told me a child did it.

1296
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:39,261
But no ordinary child.

1297
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:42,223
A child born in hell.

1298
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:48,020
Forged from suffering.

1299
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:52,441
Hardened by pain.

1300
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:56,612
Not a man from privilege.

1301
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:17,633
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1302
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:19,510
Just waiting on intel.

1303
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:26,267
You have ID?

1304
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,018
Of course not.

1305
01:49:28,186 --> 01:49:30,729
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1306
01:49:31,606 --> 01:49:33,941
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1307
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:35,651
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1308
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:38,487
It's our job, sir.
Now, how many of you are there?

1309
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:41,574
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1310
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:44,994
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1311
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:47,079
- Condition?
- Getting food and water.

1312
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,540
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1313
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:52,042
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1314
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,920
Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.

1315
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:58,299
I'm in contact with my partner
who's down there. They're just waiting.

1316
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:02,720
- Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
- Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

1317
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:05,556
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1318
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,476
They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.

1319
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:12,313
- They move it constantly.
- Good. So you know the truck?

1320
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,816
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.

1321
01:50:16,192 --> 01:50:17,234
Decoy.

1322
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:22,197
- You don't really think he's coming back?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

1323
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:26,243
Actually, it does. You should put your
faith in something a little more real.

1324
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:29,622
- The routes don't vary much.
- Okay. What about the triggerman?

1325
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:33,834
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.

1326
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:38,213
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

1327
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:42,301
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?

1328
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:45,346
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1329
01:50:45,513 --> 01:50:50,768
- We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
- You gonna tell him what's really going on?

1330
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:54,021
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1331
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:56,398
There's someone you need to meet.

1332
01:50:56,733 --> 01:51:00,611
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

1333
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:01,945
What corporation?

1334
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:04,490
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1335
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,709
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1336
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,504
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1337
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:23,133
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1338
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:25,302
- Why?
- We built it.

1339
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,970
You built the bomb?

1340
01:51:27,138 --> 01:51:31,308
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1341
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:34,853
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1342
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:38,399
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1343
01:51:38,566 --> 01:51:40,484
it becomes increasingly unstable...

1344
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:42,194
to the point of detonation.

1345
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,113
This bomb is a time bomb.

1346
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:48,283
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1347
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:51,161
or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1348
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:53,914
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1349
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:58,919
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1350
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:02,214
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1351
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:05,592
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1352
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:14,184
Someone sold us out.

1353
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,271
Go, go, go!

1354
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,669
I'll die before I talk.

1355
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:43,630
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1356
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:52,431
There were people living upstairs.

1357
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:55,058
Round them up for judgment...

1358
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:03,776
and hang them where the world can see.

1359
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:10,616
Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...

1360
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,870
as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt...

1361
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,544
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1362
01:53:23,004 --> 01:53:24,963
My body makes the jump.

1363
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:29,343
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1364
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:35,224
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1365
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:38,393
Fear is why you fail.

1366
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:40,229
No, I'm not afraid.

1367
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,398
I'm angry.

1368
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:14,096
Bruce.

1369
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:16,390
Why do we fall?

1370
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:24,314
You do not fear death.

1371
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:29,903
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1372
01:54:30,446 --> 01:54:31,488
Why?

1373
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:33,907
How can you move faster than possible...

1374
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,660
fight longer than possible...

1375
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:40,539
without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1376
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:43,417
The fear of death.

1377
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,003
I do fear death.

1378
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:49,756
I fear dying in here...

1379
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,467
while my city burns.

1380
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:55,429
There's no one there to save it.

1381
01:54:56,806 --> 01:54:58,307
Then make the climb.

1382
01:55:03,354 --> 01:55:04,688
How?

1383
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,983
As the child did...

1384
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,364
without the rope.

1385
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:19,328
Then fear will find you again.

1386
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:28,587
Supplies for your journey?

1387
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,839
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

1388
01:55:35,386 --> 01:55:37,012
What does that mean?

1389
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:38,805
Rise.

1390
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:41,183
No.

1391
01:57:11,149 --> 01:57:13,066
No, there's been a mistake!

1392
01:57:13,234 --> 01:57:15,235
Take me to Bane!

1393
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:19,489
I want to see Bane!

1394
01:57:22,744 --> 01:57:23,827
Order!

1395
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:26,747
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1396
01:57:26,914 --> 01:57:29,041
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1397
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:31,835
You are Philip Stryver...

1398
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:35,505
executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

1399
01:57:35,673 --> 01:57:39,301
who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...

1400
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:41,678
of people less powerful than him.

1401
01:57:41,846 --> 01:57:44,931
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1402
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:48,727
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1403
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,021
Now, the choice is yours.

1404
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:53,607
Exile or death!

1405
01:57:58,237 --> 01:57:59,654
Order!

1406
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,531
Exi... Exile.

1407
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:03,700
Sold.

1408
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,619
To the man in the cold sweat.

1409
01:58:13,002 --> 01:58:14,419
You follow the thick ice.

1410
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:16,713
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1411
01:58:16,881 --> 01:58:18,465
Has anyone made it?

1412
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:34,314
Where are they?
It's not like we have a lot of time.

1413
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:35,899
How long?

1414
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:37,901
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1415
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:41,321
- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1416
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:45,492
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can
start to figure out how to bring it down.

1417
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:53,458
That's it?

1418
01:58:55,962 --> 01:58:57,045
Foley.

1419
01:58:58,589 --> 01:59:02,509
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1420
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:10,142
- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

1421
01:59:10,309 --> 01:59:13,353
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1422
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:16,148
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1423
01:59:16,315 --> 01:59:18,441
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1424
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:20,944
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1425
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,239
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1426
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:28,535
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

1427
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:31,246
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1428
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:34,708
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1429
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:38,837
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1430
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,006
You think this is part of some revolution?

1431
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:44,009
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1432
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:47,262
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

1433
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:51,057
- If you still had a family here...
- This only gets fixed from inside...

1434
01:59:51,225 --> 01:59:52,809
the city!

1435
01:59:53,144 --> 01:59:54,811
Look, Peter.

1436
01:59:55,771 --> 02:00:00,358
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.

1437
02:00:00,526 --> 02:00:02,569
- Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

1438
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:04,905
What good's that gonna do
when that thing blows?

1439
02:00:05,072 --> 02:00:07,532
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1440
02:00:11,704 --> 02:00:13,997
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1441
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:15,415
How about me instead?

1442
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:18,168
Miss Tate, I can't ask you to do that.

1443
02:00:19,128 --> 02:00:20,170
Please.

1444
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:23,924
You little punk! What'd you take?

1445
02:00:24,091 --> 02:00:26,384
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1446
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:29,846
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1447
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:34,434
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

1448
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:43,610
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1449
02:00:50,284 --> 02:00:52,327
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1450
02:01:01,003 --> 02:01:03,755
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1451
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:07,259
- If you're expecting an apology, I...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1452
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:09,719
I need your help.

1453
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,721
And why would I help you?

1454
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:13,890
For this. Clean slate.

1455
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:16,059
You'd trust me with that?

1456
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:18,270
After what I did to you?

1457
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:21,356
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1458
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:26,111
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1459
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:27,862
this isn't just a tool.

1460
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:31,241
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1461
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:35,120
- I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

1462
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,830
once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1463
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:39,791
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.

1464
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:44,629
Why do you need Fox?

1465
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:47,299
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1466
02:01:47,466 --> 02:01:49,050
Maybe I like it this way.

1467
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,844
Maybe you do...

1468
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,556
but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1469
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:58,852
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1470
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,353
I'm trying...

1471
02:02:01,188 --> 02:02:02,814
but I need Fox.

1472
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:04,733
As it approaches...

1473
02:02:05,526 --> 02:02:06,693
flip the switch.

1474
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:10,405
The needle hits 200, you give me the
signal, I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1475
02:02:11,782 --> 02:02:13,408
Heads up, heads up.

1476
02:02:29,508 --> 02:02:31,801
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1477
02:02:31,969 --> 02:02:35,096
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1478
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:39,351
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1479
02:02:39,518 --> 02:02:41,227
On whose authority?

1480
02:02:41,395 --> 02:02:42,604
The people of Gotham.

1481
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:48,526
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?

1482
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,905
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1483
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:53,907
Now, what will it be?

1484
02:02:55,117 --> 02:02:57,827
Death or exile?

1485
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:02,749
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1486
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:04,501
you have another thing coming.

1487
02:03:07,004 --> 02:03:08,338
Death, then.

1488
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:10,715
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

1489
02:03:10,883 --> 02:03:12,384
Death...

1490
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:15,428
by exile.

1491
02:03:18,015 --> 02:03:19,474
Bring her to me.

1492
02:03:25,981 --> 02:03:30,193
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1493
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:33,405
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.

1494
02:03:37,535 --> 02:03:39,786
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1495
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:43,123
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1496
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:46,751
- Bruce.
- You okay?

1497
02:03:46,919 --> 02:03:49,295
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.

1498
02:03:49,463 --> 02:03:51,131
How long until that core ignites?

1499
02:03:51,298 --> 02:03:55,135
- That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1500
02:03:55,886 --> 02:03:59,013
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1501
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,058
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1502
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:04,644
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1503
02:04:04,812 --> 02:04:08,982
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1504
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:14,404
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1505
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,498
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1506
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:27,500
He should be so lucky.

1507
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:36,009
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1508
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:38,052
the triggerman sets it off.

1509
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:41,014
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1510
02:04:41,182 --> 02:04:42,849
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1511
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:45,768
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1512
02:04:45,936 --> 02:04:47,729
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1513
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:51,524
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1514
02:04:52,693 --> 02:04:54,319
Remember where you parked?

1515
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:10,168
She fly okay?

1516
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:13,922
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1517
02:05:14,089 --> 02:05:17,050
- Thanks.
- Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1518
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:59,592
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1519
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,847
Wait, wait!

1520
02:06:06,183 --> 02:06:07,642
Ross!

1521
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,185
Ross?

1522
02:06:09,812 --> 02:06:11,896
- Lock it up.
- No, keep down.

1523
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:14,148
Get down!

1524
02:06:15,776 --> 02:06:17,026
Who are you?

1525
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:47,724
Light it up.

1526
02:07:05,701 --> 02:07:08,870
- Dad, check it out.
- Honey, come take a look.

1527
02:07:19,256 --> 02:07:20,965
Impossible.

1528
02:07:21,759 --> 02:07:23,509
Keep her close.

1529
02:07:24,178 --> 02:07:25,845
He'll come for her.

1530
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,930
Where's Miranda Tate?

1531
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:30,058
Bane took her.

1532
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:33,561
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1533
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:36,356
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1534
02:07:36,523 --> 02:07:40,193
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1535
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:42,278
When what starts?

1536
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:43,988
War.

1537
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:20,983
You missed a spot.

1538
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:29,450
- If you're working alone, wear a mask.
- I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

1539
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:32,829
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1540
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,499
Count to five, then throw.

1541
02:08:46,885 --> 02:08:49,554
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1542
02:08:59,982 --> 02:09:03,109
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

1543
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:05,528
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1544
02:09:05,696 --> 02:09:07,947
- Why?
- In case we fail.

1545
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:10,825
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1546
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:12,285
You don't need me here?

1547
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:13,995
You've given me an army.

1548
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:15,329
Now go.

1549
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:17,165
Hey, thanks.

1550
02:09:17,332 --> 02:09:18,666
Don't thank me yet.

1551
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:20,877
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1552
02:09:34,725 --> 02:09:36,434
You shouldn't have.

1553
02:09:37,394 --> 02:09:39,562
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1554
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:43,107
but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1555
02:09:43,275 --> 02:09:45,109
Wait until the fighting begins.

1556
02:09:45,277 --> 02:09:47,987
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1557
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:49,197
To start it, throttle...

1558
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:54,160
- I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1559
02:09:54,328 --> 02:09:57,079
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.

1560
02:09:57,247 --> 02:10:00,541
- You don't stand a chance against these guys.
- With your help, I might.

1561
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:03,085
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1562
02:10:04,171 --> 02:10:05,755
There's more to you than that.

1563
02:10:09,426 --> 02:10:11,511
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1564
02:10:15,182 --> 02:10:16,724
Come with me.

1565
02:10:18,018 --> 02:10:19,602
Save yourself.

1566
02:10:21,855 --> 02:10:24,565
You don't owe these people any more.

1567
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:26,859
You've given them everything.

1568
02:10:27,027 --> 02:10:28,486
Not everything.

1569
02:10:28,904 --> 02:10:30,154
Not yet.

1570
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:11,863
Disperse!

1571
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:14,240
Disperse or be fired upon!

1572
02:11:15,659 --> 02:11:18,035
There's only one police in this town.

1573
02:11:57,034 --> 02:11:58,701
Open fire.

1574
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,629
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

1575
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:25,579
So you came back to die with your city.

1576
02:13:25,914 --> 02:13:29,709
No. I came back to stop you.

1577
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:41,804
Now!

1578
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:56,360
That's impossible.

1579
02:13:58,238 --> 02:13:59,864
Cut over to Fifth!

1580
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,921
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1581
02:14:16,089 --> 02:14:18,674
You, come with me. You too.

1582
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:21,927
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1583
02:14:22,095 --> 02:14:23,929
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1584
02:14:24,097 --> 02:14:26,766
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1585
02:14:26,933 --> 02:14:30,811
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1586
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:33,689
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?

1587
02:14:33,857 --> 02:14:35,733
Go, go, go!

1588
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:37,276
Is he back?

1589
02:14:38,653 --> 02:14:39,987
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1590
02:16:02,612 --> 02:16:04,155
Cover the doors!

1591
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:08,868
Where's your trigger?!

1592
02:16:09,202 --> 02:16:10,828
Where is it?!

1593
02:16:11,746 --> 02:16:14,582
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1594
02:16:14,749 --> 02:16:17,376
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1595
02:16:18,753 --> 02:16:21,463
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1596
02:16:29,264 --> 02:16:31,390
Tell me where the trigger is.

1597
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:35,477
Then you have my permission to die.

1598
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,325
I broke you.

1599
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:52,494
How have you come back?

1600
02:16:52,662 --> 02:16:57,166
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?

1601
02:16:57,334 --> 02:16:58,626
Where's the trigger?

1602
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:01,629
But I never escaped.

1603
02:17:02,505 --> 02:17:04,048
But the child.

1604
02:17:05,842 --> 02:17:07,885
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1605
02:17:08,053 --> 02:17:10,429
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1606
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:15,684
I am.

1607
02:17:16,144 --> 02:17:18,562
And though I'm not ordinary...

1608
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:21,607
I am a citizen.

1609
02:17:41,211 --> 02:17:42,378
Miranda?

1610
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:46,298
Why?

1611
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,384
Talia.

1612
02:17:49,219 --> 02:17:52,263
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1613
02:17:53,098 --> 02:17:56,517
the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1614
02:17:56,977 --> 02:17:58,018
Bane.

1615
02:18:05,986 --> 02:18:07,152
Goodbye.

1616
02:18:09,406 --> 02:18:11,532
I climbed out of the pit.

1617
02:18:17,497 --> 02:18:19,290
I found my father...

1618
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:25,379
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1619
02:18:26,256 --> 02:18:28,007
But by that time...

1620
02:18:29,134 --> 02:18:32,886
the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1621
02:18:33,054 --> 02:18:34,263
My protector.

1622
02:18:38,268 --> 02:18:39,768
The League took us in.

1623
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:41,687
Trained us.

1624
02:18:42,063 --> 02:18:44,857
But my father could not accept Bane.

1625
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:47,151
He saw only a monster.

1626
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:53,198
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1627
02:18:53,616 --> 02:18:56,744
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1628
02:18:56,911 --> 02:19:01,457
His only crime was that he loved me.

1629
02:19:03,251 --> 02:19:06,170
I could not forgive my father.

1630
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,468
Until you murdered him.

1631
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:35,783
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1632
02:19:36,076 --> 02:19:39,703
Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1633
02:19:42,332 --> 02:19:45,376
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1634
02:19:57,555 --> 02:20:02,434
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1635
02:20:03,937 --> 02:20:05,020
You see...

1636
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:07,898
it's the slow knife...

1637
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:10,692
the knife that takes its time.

1638
02:20:14,489 --> 02:20:15,697
The knife...

1639
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:20,119
that waits years without forgetting...

1640
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:23,705
then slips quietly between the bones.

1641
02:20:24,749 --> 02:20:26,041
That's the knife...

1642
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:28,710
that cuts deepest.

1643
02:20:28,878 --> 02:20:30,003
Please.

1644
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:39,721
Maybe your knife...

1645
02:20:40,723 --> 02:20:42,141
was too slow.

1646
02:20:42,308 --> 02:20:43,725
The truck is under attack.

1647
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:47,646
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.

1648
02:20:47,814 --> 02:20:48,856
No matter.

1649
02:20:51,401 --> 02:20:53,485
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1650
02:20:57,866 --> 02:20:59,366
Come on!

1651
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:01,410
This way!

1652
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,418
Stay there! What are you doing?

1653
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:13,213
Blake, MCU!
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1654
02:21:13,381 --> 02:21:14,715
You'll get us all killed!

1655
02:21:14,883 --> 02:21:17,885
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

1656
02:21:18,052 --> 02:21:21,430
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1657
02:21:21,598 --> 02:21:24,766
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!

1658
02:21:24,934 --> 02:21:28,520
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1659
02:21:30,607 --> 02:21:33,901
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

1660
02:21:37,155 --> 02:21:41,116
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1661
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:46,163
Don't kill him,
I want him to feel the heat.

1662
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:51,793
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

1663
02:21:57,717 --> 02:21:59,259
Goodbye, my friend.

1664
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:08,727
Goodbye.

1665
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:12,773
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1666
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:22,741
Shoot them.

1667
02:22:23,409 --> 02:22:24,868
Shoot them all.

1668
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:37,714
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1669
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:42,844
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1670
02:22:50,687 --> 02:22:52,729
About the whole no-guns thing...

1671
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:56,733
I'm not sure I feel as strongly
about it as you do.

1672
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:11,748
Pull up.

1673
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,877
Stay level.

1674
02:23:28,266 --> 02:23:31,560
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1675
02:23:33,396 --> 02:23:36,398
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1676
02:23:36,649 --> 02:23:39,901
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1677
02:23:40,612 --> 02:23:44,072
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

1678
02:23:44,907 --> 02:23:46,992
Please do not shoot me!

1679
02:23:48,953 --> 02:23:50,078
Shoot at his feet.

1680
02:24:00,089 --> 02:24:02,424
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1681
02:24:02,592 --> 02:24:04,676
Detective! Please stop!

1682
02:24:05,261 --> 02:24:08,347
Please, detective! Stop!

1683
02:24:08,514 --> 02:24:10,349
Stop walking!

1684
02:24:11,225 --> 02:24:13,935
Blow it! Do it!

1685
02:24:25,239 --> 02:24:27,616
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

1686
02:24:38,586 --> 02:24:40,879
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1687
02:24:41,047 --> 02:24:43,507
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1688
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:46,343
You idiots!

1689
02:24:46,636 --> 02:24:48,428
You sons of bitches!

1690
02:24:48,596 --> 02:24:50,347
You're killing us!

1691
02:24:50,515 --> 02:24:52,140
Yeah, follow your orders!

1692
02:24:52,517 --> 02:24:54,810
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

1693
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:59,523
It's on my side.

1694
02:25:47,488 --> 02:25:50,615
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back
on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

1695
02:25:50,783 --> 02:25:53,952
- Back on the bus!
- There's nowhere to go.

1696
02:25:54,495 --> 02:25:55,537
On the bus!

1697
02:26:52,428 --> 02:26:54,554
You've got to turn the truck east!

1698
02:26:59,477 --> 02:27:01,228
Stay straight!

1699
02:27:32,969 --> 02:27:36,346
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1700
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:45,939
Fox showed me how to override
the reactor.

1701
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:50,944
Oh, dear.

1702
02:27:54,657 --> 02:27:57,993
Including the emergency flood.

1703
02:28:14,385 --> 02:28:16,303
There's no way...

1704
02:28:17,221 --> 02:28:18,471
this bomb...

1705
02:28:19,348 --> 02:28:20,891
will be stopped.

1706
02:28:22,101 --> 02:28:23,226
What are you doing?

1707
02:28:23,394 --> 02:28:25,770
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

1708
02:28:25,938 --> 02:28:27,230
It's an atom bomb!

1709
02:28:27,398 --> 02:28:30,066
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!

1710
02:28:30,985 --> 02:28:32,652
Prepare yourselves.

1711
02:28:34,363 --> 02:28:36,406
My father's work...

1712
02:28:37,658 --> 02:28:39,326
is done.

1713
02:28:45,124 --> 02:28:48,043
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

1714
02:28:48,502 --> 02:28:50,712
Set it to fly out over
the water, then eject?

1715
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:52,505
No autopilot.

1716
02:28:54,133 --> 02:28:57,510
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.

1717
02:28:57,678 --> 02:28:58,803
So did you.

1718
02:28:59,263 --> 02:29:01,306
I guess we're both suckers.

1719
02:29:08,981 --> 02:29:11,816
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1720
02:29:11,984 --> 02:29:14,569
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1721
02:29:14,737 --> 02:29:15,904
A hero can be anyone.

1722
02:29:16,072 --> 02:29:18,990
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...

1723
02:29:19,158 --> 02:29:23,036
as putting a coat around a young boy's
shoulders to let him know...

1724
02:29:23,204 --> 02:29:24,996
the world hadn't ended.

1725
02:29:42,723 --> 02:29:44,182
Bruce Wayne?

1726
02:29:57,279 --> 02:30:00,407
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1727
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:21,553
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1728
02:30:21,887 --> 02:30:24,806
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

1729
02:31:13,022 --> 02:31:14,314
That's detonation!

1730
02:31:21,781 --> 02:31:23,698
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1731
02:31:43,552 --> 02:31:46,387
I see a beautiful city...

1732
02:31:46,555 --> 02:31:48,681
and a brilliant people...

1733
02:31:48,933 --> 02:31:50,934
rising from this abyss.

1734
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:56,147
I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...

1735
02:31:56,565 --> 02:31:57,774
peaceful...

1736
02:31:58,526 --> 02:32:01,778
useful, prosperous and happy.

1737
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,867
I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...

1738
02:32:09,703 --> 02:32:12,872
and in the hearts
of their descendants...

1739
02:32:13,707 --> 02:32:15,416
generations hence.

1740
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:22,340
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1741
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:25,176
than I have ever done.

1742
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,723
It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

1743
02:32:33,644 --> 02:32:35,353
"...than I have ever known."

1744
02:32:53,706 --> 02:32:55,123
I'm so sorry.

1745
02:32:55,499 --> 02:32:57,208
I failed you.

1746
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:00,879
You trusted me...

1747
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,590
and I failed you.

1748
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,512
Can I change your mind...

1749
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:13,766
about quitting the force?

1750
02:33:14,685 --> 02:33:18,521
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1751
02:33:18,898 --> 02:33:22,442
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1752
02:33:22,651 --> 02:33:26,946
I mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1753
02:33:27,156 --> 02:33:28,239
They know.

1754
02:33:30,159 --> 02:33:31,868
It was the Batman.

1755
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:53,514
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.

1756
02:33:53,682 --> 02:33:57,518
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1757
02:33:57,686 --> 02:34:01,147
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1758
02:34:01,315 --> 02:34:05,652
and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1759
02:34:07,112 --> 02:34:11,991
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1760
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,870
they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1761
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:19,832
and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1762
02:34:21,502 --> 02:34:25,755
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1763
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:30,802
My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.

1764
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,387
Blake, John.

1765
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:35,932
- Nothing here.
- Try my legal name.

1766
02:34:39,353 --> 02:34:42,146
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

1767
02:34:42,314 --> 02:34:44,190
- Robin.
- Thanks.

1768
02:34:44,358 --> 02:34:46,526
Why worry about
the stabilization software?

1769
02:34:46,694 --> 02:34:48,695
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1770
02:34:48,862 --> 02:34:52,657
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1771
02:34:52,825 --> 02:34:56,953
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1772
02:34:57,121 --> 02:34:58,705
Check the ID on the patch.

1773
02:35:01,792 --> 02:35:03,376
Bruce Wayne.

1774
02:35:04,253 --> 02:35:06,546
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1775
02:35:06,714 --> 02:35:08,131
They better leave no stone unturned.

1776
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:11,718
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.
