I want my lawyer.

cooperate.

Aren't you
a working man now?

Shouldn't you be at
the SCPD?

Uh, they need a little
help from Team Arrow...

Specifically you.

- Cool.
- You need to analyze this DNA.

Hey, you OK?

You know, this has
to be a shock,

244
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,399
not as big as
a shock as maybe

245

becoming the flash and then
fighting alongside batwoman,

246

but still a shock.

247
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,997
I have come to terms
with the fact that

248
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,274
my father kept things
from us.

249
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Yeah.

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,920
Hey, maybe you should
reach out to her.

251
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,600
I feel like if she
wanted to talk to me,

252
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,096
she would've come
and talked to me.

she's running around town dressed like you.

I mean, I'm no therapist,
but I'm pretty sure

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,656
the technical term for
that is cry for help.

256
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,114
She has to have a reason.

257
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Yeah.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,072
I don't feel comfortable
just barging into her life,

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,434
not without knowing more.

260
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,831
I need answers.

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
Well, luckily for you,
your wife is

invisible people.

Some even call her
a genius.

264
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,991
So one thing we know about
your father is that he loved

265
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,440
a good old-fashioned
paper trail.

266
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,073
He used an offshore
account to handle

267
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,551
some of his more sensitive
financial transactions.

268
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,719
Yup, recurring payments
to m & h storage

in orchid bay,
and the good news is

270
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,560
the account is still
active.

271
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,976
We need whatever's in
that storage unit.

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,753
We need it here immediately.

273
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,357
OK. Copy that.
And...

[Beeps]

275
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
One more thing.

276
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Just one more?

277
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,400
The account is not
registered to your father.

278
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,753
It's registered
to your mom.

279
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,034
There he is...

280
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,480
The man himself.

281
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
You think you're
gonna be the one

282
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,990
to get me to talk?

283
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,879
Let me make one thing
clear, Ricardo.

284
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,830
You will tell us exactly
what we need to know.

285
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,279

before.

I'm not here to play
any games with you.

I'm here to offer
you a deal.

290
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,280
John, what are you doing?

291
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
Deputy Director Bell.

292
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
What are you doing here?

293
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,336
The Pentagon sent
me to help deal

with the situation
brewing in kahndaq.

295
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Imagine my surprise
when I heard

296
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,877
a rumor that you had
taken Ricardo Diaz

297
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,076
into A.R.G.U.S. custody.

298
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,833
Clearly not just a rumor.

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,320
What kind of deal?

300
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,480
[Sighs]

301
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,755
It's simple, really.

302
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,197
You give us Dante,
you go free.

303
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,709
Are you serious?

304
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,189
Those are the terms.

305
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,071
Bell: Mr. Diggle,
a word.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,036
You think about it.

307
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Ricardo Diaz
was just arrested.

308
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
Now you two want
to set him free?

309
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,075
What the hell
is going on here?

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,152
My apologies for not
looping you in sooner, sir.

311
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,073
Director Michaels and I
were in the process

312
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,994
of reinstating
the ghost initiative.

313
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,155
And Mr. Diaz here was
our first potential recruit.

314
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Bell: <i>What's that?</i>

315
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,238
A defunct A.R.G.U.S.
program that employed

316
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,995
expendable criminals
for covert operations.

317
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,236
It was scrubbed

318
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,073
shortly after
my predecessor died.

319
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,200
And you think it's a good
idea to bring it back?

320
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,312
Are you questioning
my decision,

321
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,713
deputy director?

322
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,073
Of course not,
madam director.

323
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,515
That kind of radical,
out-of-the-box approach is

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm sure the Pentagon

326
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,196
to hear about this.

327
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,832
Nice work, agent.

OK.

It was, but I'm better now.

Good. Because
the education initiative

something else

Mm-hmm.

Someone's planning
an attack on Star City.

Zoe, please tell me you
haven't been talking to Dinah.

They're planning
to set off multiple bombs.

And we need
to find out where.

352
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,910
I want you to give
the SCPD access

to the Archer Program.

354

You want me to use
our security system,

355
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,199
the very thing that
keeps us safe,

don't you dare talk to me
about my responsibility!

360

When The Glades
needed help,

361
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
no one came to
our rescue.

362
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,511
Dad, if this bomb
goes off,

363
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,000
thousands of people
could die.

364
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,958
How could you turn
your back on that?

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,798
The Archer Program wiped
out crime in The Glades

366
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,599
and helped it
thrive.

367

You do remember
what happened

368

when it fell in the
wrong hands once.

369
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,074
And we barely
recovered.

Oh. So I'm the wrong hands?

371
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
You know that's not
what I meant.

372

You know what I know is,

373
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,840
is that you used to stand up
for anyone in need.

374
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,416
It didn't matter which part
of town they were from.

375
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,079
You were a hero.

376
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,034
What happened to you?

377
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
I want to know why.

378
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

379
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,310
Why do you want
to help me?

380
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,750
'Cause we're the same.

You said your mission
is personal.

So is mine.

384
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,472
I watched as my wife
got shot to death

385

by a drug dealer
from these streets.

386
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,114
And for a long time,
all I saw was red.

387
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
Then I met Oliver Queen
and the team,

388
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
and they helped me
channel my anger

for a better life.

to pay that forward.

My friends, my team...

397
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,274
they... they moved on, found
another way to be heroes.

398

And I've been running around
the city helping you.

this many boxes,

delivered to our living room.

a waste of time.

we used this quilt

We'd play so long that

we'd just fall asleep there.

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,554
because who gives a damn

485
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,359
about some tenement
in The Glades?

486
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,176
By the time
they finally arrived,

487
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
there were no survivors.

488
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,436
Your mom was in there.

489
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,992
It wasn't the fire
that killed her.

490
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
He did.

491
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,070
She was dead before
the fire even started.

492
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,560
He put a bullet in her head,

493
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,320
a very specific
kind of bullet.

494
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,796
You tracked a bullet?

495
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
Why would he kill your mom?

496
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
That's what I've been
trying to figure out.

497
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I know these guys.

498
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,200
The arms dealer who
provided the rifle

499
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,400
and the arsonist who tried
to destroy all the evidence.

500
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,750
Your mission
is about revenge.

501
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,999
It's about justice,

502
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,310
which has always been in
short supply in The Glades.

503
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,152
William Glenmorgan is
my last stop.

504
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,993
And you need help
taking him down.

505
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,397
I need to finish this.

506
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,873
Let's go get that
son of a bitch.

507
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,717
[Rain, thunder]

508
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,269
You lost your edge.

509
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,996
What the hell do you want?

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,038
I want your access codes
to Archer.

511
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,993
So you have been talking
to Zoe.

512
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,520
If you've gotten her mixed
up in your canary business...

513
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,319
she's not a kid
anymore,

514
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,195
and that's not
why I'm here.

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,357
We found this in Felicity's
base of operations.

516
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,675
She's a criminal.

517
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,354
Criminals like
to blow stuff up.

518
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
Felicity's dead, Rene.

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,036
<i>She was murdered.</i>

520
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,840
And we think the person
who killed her was

521
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,234
behind this plan.

522
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,716
Like I told Zoe,

523
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,475
whatever happens in
Star City isn't my problem.

524
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,876
Well, the old Rene would've
made it his problem.

525
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,434
Jeez.
Do you have any idea

526
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,432
how much you've hurt
your daughter?

527
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,514
She used to idolize you.

528
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,273
At least as mayor,

529
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,234
I'm actually getting
things done,

530
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,755
not wasting my time
running around the city

531
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,191
with a hockey mask,
pretending that it mattered.

532
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,840
It did matter!

533
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,233
<i>And it still matters.</i>

534
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,113
We made a promise
to always keep fighting,

535
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,274
to be there for each
other no matter what...

536
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,355
all of us...

537
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,960
you, me, Roy, Diggle,
Oliver, and Felicity.

538
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,440
We owe her this.

539
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,757
The next time
you come back here,

540
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,320
I will have you arrested.

541
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,756
And you stay the hell away
from my daughter.

542
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
[Thud]

543
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,992
For Zoe's sake, I do not
want to hurt you,

544
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,277
but I'm not leaving here
without those codes.

545
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,616
The last time we fought
each other,

546
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,597
it didn't end so well
for you.

547
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,275
Hey. You are
still upset.

548
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Damn right.

549
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,576
You had no right
to make that call.

550
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,136
You're right. It is way
above my pay grade,

551
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,674
but it worked out
for us.

552
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,479
Is that your version
of an apology?

553
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,030
Hey, Lyla,
you have to admit,

554
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,560
I actually did help.

555
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,917
I'm the one who shut down
the ghost initiative.

556
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,834
And I swore never
to reinstate it.

557
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,195
You knew that.

558
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,839
I know that,
but you would have

559
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,116
absolute oversight
and zero accountability.

560
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,476
This is the perfect cover
for our operation.

561
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,360
Lyla, we had to do something
to get Diaz to play ball.

562
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,393
Which you did by

563
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,756
undermining my authority
and forcing my hand.

564
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,160
And here I thought I was
the one in danger

565
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,879
of becoming
Amanda Waller.

566
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,896
Glenmorgan is holed up
in his compound

567
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,990
outside Star City.

568
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,514
I spotted at least
10 bodyguards.

569
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,956
So the killer's surrounded
by even more killers. Great.

570
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,280
And he's got a bleeding edge
security system.

571
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Bypassing security system's
is gonna be a piece of cake.

572
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,336
You guys have cake?
I mean, I don't want cake,

573
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,816
but if you got a cake,
I would have a piece.

574
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,896
But if you don't have it,
don't worry about it.

575
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,016
You don't have it, right?
OK. Anyway, it's... yeah, hi.

to letting people help you,

to get to Glenmorgan,
