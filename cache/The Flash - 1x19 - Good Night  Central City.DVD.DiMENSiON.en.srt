1
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,420
Don't move a muscle,
or I'll come back in there.

2
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,485
Freeze!

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,088
Drop your weapon.

4
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,896
Harry, you again? Come on.
How many times we gotta do this, huh?

5
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,868
You're a bad boy, Harry.
Use a gun, go to prison.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,032
- You guys need any help?
- Hey, it's all right. We got him.

7
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,337
We're old buddies. Come on,
you know the routine. Hands behind you.

8
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,003
Come on.

9
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,818
- Another rough night, Murph?
- Oh, boy.

10
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,921
Three days without sleep.
I even tried what you suggested.

11
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,556
You know, counting sheep.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,954
Last night at dawn, I had 2300.

13
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,219
You counted 2300 sheep?

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,922
Well, actually, I counted
their legs and divided by four.

15
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,833
Boy, maybe I should ask him
what his secret is.

16
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,037
He's not asleep, Murph.

17
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,642
- Well, you can do the honors.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,985
So, what's he so happy about, huh?

19
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,420
No rigor.

20
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,025
Poor Harry.

21
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,093
- You know this guy?
- Only by reputation.

22
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,632
As a not particularly gifted
B-and-E and stickup man.

23
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,202
Did go to school with his cousin.
What did he die of?

24
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,169
Beats me. They just brought him in.

25
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,099
I'm taking him off to the pathologist
for slice and dice.

26
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,980
Hold it.

27
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,385
It looks like the kind of thing
some doctors prescribe...

28
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,821
...for their patients to induce endorphins.
Helps people quit smoking.

29
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,085
Think it worked on Harry?

30
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,090
Oh, gotta go upstairs.

31
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,231
Do me a favor and close him up
when you're through, huh?

32
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,959
You got it.

33
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,902
Well...

34
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,398
...rest in peace, Harry.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,899
Come on. Oh, come on. Come on.

36
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,238
Harry, wake up.

37
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,943
- Roger, I was just dreaming about you.
- Listen, we gotta be really quiet.

38
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,171
I was dreaming...

39
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,839
I was dreaming that I was trying
to pick the lock at the Taj Mahal.

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,213
And then... And then...

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,413
- Man, I've been shrink-wrapped.
- We gotta get out of here...

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,787
...before someone comes in. Here.
Put this on.

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,053
Come on. Put this on.

44
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,958
Come on.

45
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,892
It worked. Roger, it worked.

46
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,497
- You're a genius!
- Yeah, well, maybe.

47
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,336
This thing that put me to sleep,
that's the key.

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,569
All you gotta do is make it bigger.

49
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,511
We could sing our own lullaby
to this whole city. Come on.

50
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,712
Look, this has been going
on for three weeks, all right?

51
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,878
My credit rating is ruined. I'm being
hounded by collection agencies.

52
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,047
No, you listen to me.

53
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,557
This is Barry Patrick Allen
from Central City, not to be confused...

54
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,095
...with that deadbeat Barry Peter Allen
from Centerville.

55
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,166
You'll get back to me? But...

56
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,859
Hello?

57
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,233
Damn! I don't believe these people.

58
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,570
- Financial hell week, eh?
- May they strangle in their own red tape.

59
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,769
Well, Garfield's on his way up
with a guy from Internal Affairs...

60
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,313
...who wants a look at our recent files.
- Our recent files aren't filed.

61
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,544
Yeah, and we're also behind on that
stack of evidence-analysis requests.

62
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,484
- I thought you were...
- I would have...

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,352
...but I had this emergency DNA profile
for Homicide.

64
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,429
Which I have to hand-carry
downtown right now. Good luck.

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
You'll pay for this.

66
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,767
Okay.

67
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,858
Lieutenant. Just catching up
on some work.

68
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,326
Good.

69
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,398
This is Jack Farrow
from Internal Affairs.

70
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,364
How do you do?

71
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,660
We got a problem
with the Harry Milgrim case.

72
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,432
Harry Milgrim.
Got the file right over here.

73
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,973
- Milgrim's gone.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

74
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,580
It's too bad, isn't it? In spite
of the fact that he really was a...

75
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,182
No, I mean, he's gone.

76
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,784
- Gone?
- His body disappeared last night.

77
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,817
- Well, what happened to it?
- Oh, that's a good question.

78
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,650
A man dies in custody,
the department is responsible.

79
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,390
But we don't even know
what killed this guy.

80
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,499
Well, he's bound to turn up.

81
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,532
- Isn't he?
- You were the last person...

82
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,935
...signed in to see him.
- It's not like he was going anywhere.

83
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,868
Well, something happened, didn't it?

84
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,705
I'll expect to hear from you
on this soon.

85
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,579
What did the morgue say?

86
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,085
The attendant on duty is like a monkey
with its paws over its face.

87
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,818
Didn't hear anything, see anything.
Just says you were the last to see Milgrim.

88
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,554
There's something else
I need to talk to you about.

89
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,528
Personnel got a letter from
a credit company about your debt.

90
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,998
- They want to attach your wages.
- Well, it's a mistake, lieutenant.

91
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,638
- It's some kind of computer error.
- Well, that's good.

92
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
Try to clear it up. It looks bad.

93
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,741
And I need you to look into
this Milgrim business...

94
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,677
...and notify the next of kin
that the remains were misplaced.

95
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,009
- But, sir...
- Today.

96
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,244
Farrow wants to climb the career ladder
by stepping on my back.

97
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,445
Help me get him off.

98
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,072
Did I look that dead?

99
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,974
Yes, absolutely. Vital signs so slow
they mimic death.

100
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,843
Do you know how much money
we're going to make off of this?

101
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,450
Sure. Just think of what you can do
with it.

102
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,782
Long space voyages, life extension.

103
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,619
Right, right. But first things first.
Research requires funds, am I right?

104
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,023
- You're right, Harry, but this...
- But nothing.

105
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,323
Did you ever have any luck with
any of those grants you applied for?

106
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,333
Anybody ever listen to you
at a university or a corporation?

107
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,368
- No, Harry.
- Who cares about you?

108
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,869
- You do, Harry.
- Right.

109
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,167
But we can make a legitimate business
out of the sleep inducer.

110
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,140
Don't even think about that now, coz.

111
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,712
You never had any problem accepting
money from those other jobs we did.

112
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,283
And just remember one thing.
You are in as deep as I am.

113
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,888
If I go down, you go down.

114
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,545
I know.

115
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,982
Yeah, so stop griping.

116
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,127
This thing, it's gonna make us big.

117
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,890
All you gotta do is lay back
and enjoy the ride.

118
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,229
- Yes?
- <i>Roger. It's Barry Allen.</i>

119
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,704
<i>Can I talk to you for a minute?</i>

120
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,440
Sure. Up the stairs,
first door on your right.

121
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,416
Just get in here.

122
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

123
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,567
- I don't think you remember me.
- Barry Allen from Central High?

124
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,567
Yeah, yeah. We spoke for a couple
minutes at the 10th reunion.

125
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,507
I remember you.
We were in Science Club together.

126
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,041
Well...

127
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,149
...still at it, I see.

128
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,343
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,979
Hey, what's this?

130
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:55,856
Oh, it's, you know, nothing important
really. You know, just some stuff.

131
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,989
Rog, I think your mice have had it.

132
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,499
Yeah. Well, nobody lives forever, right?

133
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,740
That's... That's a combination
wiper-defroster unit.

134
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,244
You see, the wipers
are internally heated.

135
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,776
Yeah, but they overheat.
There's some microchips that don't...

136
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,855
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,490
I'll have this under control
in just a minute.

138
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,459
Don't worry. Don't panic.

139
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,494
I never got the bugs out of it.

140
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,199
Well...

141
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,864
...what's that?

142
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,340
It's a washing machine for human beings.
It really conserves a lot of water.

143
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,573
- I could use one for my dog.
- Sure.

144
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,516
Listen, Roger, I hope it's not
too painful for you...

145
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,817
...but the reason I'm here is to talk to you
about your cousin Harry.

146
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,821
- You heard what happened?
- Yeah, I'm with the police department.

147
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,892
Crime Lab.

148
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,589
And...

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,494
I don't know how to say this,
but the morgue lost Harry's remains.

150
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,428
Lost them?

151
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,475
Yeah. I was wondering if there was
anything unusual in Harry's medical history.

152
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,942
Like narcolepsy or catalepsy.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,408
You mean, where someone appears
to be dead and then wakes up.

154
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,050
Right.

155
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:31,383
No. Harry never had anything like that.
Why? You think Harry's still alive?

156
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,527
I don't know. It's weird, though.

157
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,423
Well, if you find out anything,
call me at the station, all right?

158
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,365
Yeah, sure, I will. And please
let me know anything that you find out.

159
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,528
Yeah, I will.

160
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,106
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

161
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,234
Goodbye.

162
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,811
Harry.

163
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,929
- I almost died in that thing for real.
- He's with the police.

164
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,828
- Now the cops are on to us.
- Oh, bull.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,165
Sure, they had to investigate,
but they got nothing. You worry too much.

166
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,609
Puffer-fish toxin can
used to create so-called zombies...

167
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,273
...a form of suspended animation.

168
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,749
I don't think there any drugs
involved here, Tina.

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,718
He had this clipped behind his ear.

170
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,822
- It's warm.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,694
There's a very subtle vibration.

172
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,831
Not much to see, though.

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,594
A sealed transistorized piece.

174
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,337
It's humming.

175
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,499
It's quite nice.

176
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,916
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

177
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,608
What was that?

178
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,812
- This did it.
- It's not the object, it's the rhythm.

179
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,152
Well, I guess your inventor friend
is really on to something.

180
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,334
Hey, what's that?

181
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,634
Don't be nervous.
It'll work like a dream.

182
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,176
Wait a minute
We have an agreement. No violence.

183
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,406
Then I won't have to use the gun, will I?

184
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,416
- So let's go, before we get made.
- All right.

185
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,551
Here. These earplugs
will filter out the signal.

186
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,196
<i>Attention, all units in vicinity:</i>

187
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,703
<i>Central City Savings,</i>
<i>400 block North Chandler.</i>

188
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,072
<i>Silent alarm activated.</i>
<i>Possible robbery in progress.</i>

189
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,597
Gentlemen.

190
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,906
You see, even he's not immune.

191
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,376
No!

192
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,484
- Are you crazy?!
- No violence! Now, that's the deal.

193
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,080
That's for us.
We gotta get out of here.

194
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,281
If you think I'm leaving empty-handed,
you're out of your skull.

195
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,016
What are you doing?

196
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:32,152
Harry, come on.
Come on, please, Harry!

197
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,423
Harry, please. Let's go.

198
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,125
We gotta get out of here now!

199
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,328
- Harry, please!
- All right, get the machine.

200
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,979
- Barry, what happened?
- Why, everybody passed out.

201
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,020
- Well, what was it, knockout gas?
- I don't know.

202
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,147
You were out too, Allen?

203
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,757
- Of course.
- It's funny finding you here, isn't it?

204
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,830
What were you doing in the bank?

205
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:52,137
I heard the call, I was in the vicinity,
so I responded to see if I could help out.

206
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,644
- You got a problem with that?
- Just tell us again what happened.

207
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,943
- Here's the files.
- I looked in the window...

208
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,551
...and I saw the two suspects.

209
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,519
I entered the bank
to try to make an arrest...

210
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,385
...and passed out cold.

211
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,860
These the guys you saw,
was one of them Harry Milgrim?

212
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,057
- The last time I saw Harry, he was dead.
- Oh, yeah, but you knew he was still alive.

213
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,226
- What are you talking about?
- Isn't that Harry Milgrim?

214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,864
- Yeah, that's Harry.
- And this is you, right?

215
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,939
These pictures were taken
within a moment of each other.

216
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,969
What?

217
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,182
Harry must have been hiding.

218
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,409
Why would he hide?
You're plotting with him.

219
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,317
- You wanna make a formal accusation...
- Allen is in debt up to his ear.

220
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,821
That's a computer error!

221
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,756
Allen knows these guys.
He went to school with the cousin.

222
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,295
- He was in the loft with Milgrim.
- I didn't know Harry was in there.

223
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,626
Which leads me to believe
Allen freed Milgrim...

224
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,897
...and did the bank job with him,
both times using the sleep gimmick.

225
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,304
But somehow Allen got left behind
when the alarm suddenly went off.

226
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,371
Why don't you get
some coffee, Farrow.

227
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,513
Now.

228
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,682
- He's out of his mind.
- Look, you take it easy, Allen.

229
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,254
Farrow finds a bad apple in our barrel
and that makes his career.

230
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,058
Now, I want to believe you.

231
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,895
But is there anything at all
you want to tell me?

232
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,527
I think it's fairly clear where I stand
on this, lieutenant. I am innocent!

233
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,173
All right.

234
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,107
- I want you to take couple days off.
- Lieutenant!

235
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,472
I want you out of harm's way.

236
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,119
We should've cleaned that bank out.
All we got was a taste.

237
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,520
It was just a random event.

238
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,162
The Flash can't be at every bank
during every robbery.

239
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,730
I had my way, that's the last time
he'd be anywhere.

240
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,867
I don't wanna talk about that.

241
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,698
Now, if we wanna expand,
we gotta find some help.

242
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,841
Let's see if we can get a pro
for our team.

243
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,603
Hey, Harry. I heard you were dead.

244
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,803
Then you just saw a ghost.

245
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,507
- You understand me, Fosnight?
- Sure, Harry.

246
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,983
I'll send you a wreath.

247
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,895
Stan Morse.

248
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,623
- This is my cousin Roger.
- I got your message. I ain't interested.

249
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,825
- Why not?
- Am I ever interested in your schemes?

250
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,830
Do yourself a favor, pal,
stay away from the Loksh.

251
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,140
Well, it's your loss, Stan,
you don't want in on it.

252
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,340
Plenty of other guys would be interested
in working the sleep angle with us.

253
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,506
Smarter guys.

254
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,749
Come on, Roger.

255
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,047
Hey, wait a minute. You did this?

256
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,081
- Guilty.
- You better be.

257
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,758
I swear, Harry. None of your antics.

258
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,362
So you want in or not?

259
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,431
Step into my office.

260
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,404
There you are, miss.

261
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,919
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
What is that...?

262
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,890
Oh, this is great. Look at this!

263
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,631
Roger, Roger. Look. Look!

264
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,697
We better get out.

265
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,135
- We gotta go now.
- Come on, Roger, live a little. Look.

266
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,366
Harry, we got enough.

267
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,134
Come on.

268
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,206
- Harry!
- You know, he's right.

269
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,940
Your problem is, you never know
when to get out. Let's move it.

270
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,961
I might have to go through
a departmental hearing.

271
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,363
I can't believe they're
raking me over the coals.

272
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,164
- Barry, if you've done nothing wrong...
- Tina, technical innocence isn't enough.

273
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,569
When you're a cop,
a shadow of doubt is too much.

274
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,835
The only way I'm gonna clear
my name is by solving this case.

275
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,811
And it all hangs on this damn thing.
Anything new on it?

276
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,213
Yes. I don't think the mechanism
itself is very important.

277
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,513
But the sound has to correspond
with a combination of brain waves...

278
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,986
...that brings on a coma.

279
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,625
What I have to do is isolate
that combination.

280
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,320
Well, it's just a sound. You should be able
to block it with earplugs, yes?

281
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,626
Not ordinary earplugs. You could
still feel it through bone conduction.

282
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,530
But there is a more
dangerous problem.

283
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:22,470
If the brain function drops to this level
for too long, then you'll die.

284
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,077
Well, those people in the bank
were all right after they woke up.

285
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,905
They weren't unconscious
long enough.

286
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,982
But if these thieves keep using this device,
sooner or later, somebody is going to die.

287
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,618
McGee.

288
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,618
Yes. Thank you.

289
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,556
I've asked to be kept informed
if there's any more news. There is.

290
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,428
<i>Another slumber robbery</i>
<i>shocked the city.</i>

291
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,895
<i>This time, thieves made up with loot</i>
<i>to the tune of $ 20 million...</i>

292
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>... according to authorities.</i>

293
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,469
<i>In related news, we've received</i>
<i>a report that Police Officer Barry Allen...</i>

294
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,665
<i>... a forensic specialist,</i>
<i>who was present during the robbery...</i>

295
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,902
<i>... is being questioned</i>
<i>in connection with it.</i>

296
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,410
<i>Authorities are calling this</i>
<i>a bizarre incident...</i>

297
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,947
Now Farrow is using the press
to plead his case.

298
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,017
I've gotta put a stop to this.

299
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,884
- Where are you going?
- Visit an old classmate.

300
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,749
Now, that's my version
of a sleeping machine.

301
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,484
Swede, round up the boys.

302
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,131
Hurry up. Those won't be
the only cops nosing around.

303
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,997
So, Stan, take a look.
This is where it all started.

304
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,763
Yeah.

305
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,041
With a big signal,
we could take down a lot of things.

306
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,509
With a booster attachment, we could have
as big a signal as we want. Right, Roger?

307
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,808
Right. It's in here. Somewhere.

308
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,645
We can get into places
we couldn't get into before.

309
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,152
- I mean, we could sack...
- The whole town.

310
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,849
You like it? Good night, Central City.

311
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,494
- What an idea.
- We're only as big as we want to be in life.

312
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,656
So are we ready, Rog?

313
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,702
No. No. I'm sorry,
but the game is over.

314
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,205
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- The mice. The mice are dead.

315
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,474
So? Now you can afford
to buy new ones.

316
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,609
You don't understand. I was testing
the sleep amplifier on the mice...

317
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,274
...and it killed them.
- So what?

318
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,046
So if it's left on long enough,
it'll kill people.

319
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,482
Oh, yeah. So, well, we'll just turn it off
before anybody gets hurt.

320
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,356
No, no. It's way too risky.
I won't be responsible for murder.

321
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,960
Look, don't we have enough?
All those diamonds.

322
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,328
- I knew it.
- Look, look.

323
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,199
Just give me one second.

324
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,310
- Give me that damn booster.
- No.

325
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,469
Harry, put that away. I'm your family.

326
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,808
- Give me it!
- No.

327
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,188
You shot me.

328
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,224
I told you, Roger.

329
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,606
- Stay away!
- You're hurt.

330
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,214
Roger, what happened?
Are you all right?

331
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:59,653
- We've gotta get you some help.
- Barry, I thought I saw something else.

332
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,423
I must have been hallucinating.

333
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,023
They wanna do big things.

334
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,063
They wanna use my machine
on the whole city.

335
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,366
Just hold on, Roger.

336
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,799
Roger.

337
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,404
He must have been waiting for us.

338
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,842
It's the only way he could've
jumped us like that.

339
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,141
He's fast, all right.
Never even saw him.

340
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,944
Let's see.

341
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,312
"Barry Allen, 270 Edgemore Avenue."

342
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,549
Hey, wait a minute. This is the cop
they talked about on the news.

343
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,819
They think he's involved.

344
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,986
This is perfect.

345
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,874
Barry. Barry.

346
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,305
- Barry!
- Lieutenant.

347
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,236
- Roger's been hurt.
- He's dead, Barry.

348
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,152
He was killed with this.
It was in your hand.

349
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,685
- What?
- What happened here?

350
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:08,018
It's obvious. Allen knocked off
Braintree to silence him.

351
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,419
You wanna read him his rights,
or do I have to do it?

352
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,771
Barry, I just want you to know that
all the guys are with you on this, okay?

353
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,078
A hundred percent. There's no way
we believe these bogus charges.

354
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,744
If you say you're innocent,
that's good enough for us.

355
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,389
Thanks, Murph.

356
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,420
- You are innocent, right?
- Yes.

357
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,528
Okay, okay. You have a visitor.

358
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:50,066
You can talk, but don't talk too long.
Otherwise I'm in big trouble. Okay?

359
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,896
Ms. McGee.

360
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,467
- Barry, what are they doing to you?
- It's a frame, Tina.

361
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,907
The guys with the machine
murdered the inventor...

362
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,378
...and made it look like I did it.
- But how could anyone believe that?

363
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,881
I found a good lawyer,
and he'll able to help you.

364
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,883
I can't worry with that right now.

365
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,750
First I have to find Harry Milgrim
and his pals.

366
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,151
I've been working
on the computer simulation.

367
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,850
No human could survive
exposure to the sleep signal...

368
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,620
...for more than two hours.

369
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:23,029
I've isolated the sound pattern and I'm
working on the earplug filter, but l...

370
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,194
Lieutenant, listen to her. Harry's machine
is going to kill people all over town.

371
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,199
Are you sure you don't want
to tell me something?

372
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,843
Yes. I've told you everything.

373
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,079
- It's your share of the diamond-center job.
- What?

374
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,810
Found it in your bedroom closet.

375
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,417
- The blue one goes where?
- No, no. The red one, the red one.

376
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,114
Yeah, I know it's the red one,
but where does it go?

377
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,293
Oh, yeah, that's it.

378
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,925
- Is this thing gonna work?
- I'll stake my life on it.

379
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,792
You are. We all are.

380
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,630
Hey, lighten up, Stan. I wired it
just like Roger's note said.

381
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,865
This will patch the sleep unit into all
the old air-raid sirens throughout the city.

382
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,908
And we can control it by this
from wherever we are.

383
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,875
I bet they haven't tested these sirens
in over 20 years.

384
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,038
I checked the panel.
Those circuits are hot.

385
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,413
And those horns were built to last.
They'll be heard all over town.

386
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:53,148
When I hit this button,
it's lights out.

387
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,017
Go ahead, lock her up, Swede.

388
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,857
- What's that?
- I had the Swede here set up a lock.

389
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,398
If a security patrol comes by,
they won't have time to break in.

390
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,866
Good thinking, Stan.

391
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,565
Yeah, I thought so.

392
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,707
How many ways do
you want me to say this?

393
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,865
They stole my keys
when I was unconscious.

394
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,444
You'd do yourself good if you'd tell us
where the next score is gonna be.

395
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,410
If I knew, I would tell you.

396
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,874
Roger said something about
knocking out the whole city.

397
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,610
Oh, the whole city.

398
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,347
Putting a room full of people
to sleep is one thing.

399
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,515
- But if you expect me to believe...
- Damn it. Why take the risk?

400
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,719
Just let me out, and I'll help you
find out what's going down.

401
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,059
It's a stupid bluff, Allen.
I'm not buying it.

402
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,700
Unbelievable!

403
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,372
- Is that the guy, the witch-finder general?
- Yeah, that's him.

404
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,136
Nobody I can talk to believes this jerk.

405
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,281
Look, we're all rooting for you,
all right? This is a nightmare.

406
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,544
I think I'm awake. But a lot of people won't
be shortly, and they could sleep forever.

407
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,313
You're not the only one worried.
They beefed up patrols.

408
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,013
Everybody's looking out for Harry
and that other guy.

409
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,887
- Is there anything I can get you?
- How about a cake?

410
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,086
Put a file in it.

411
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,693
- Yeah. Well, you hang in there, man.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,392
Where else?

413
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,840
Hey, Mingo. Any chance
at calling out for a pizza?

414
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,134
Oh, bless you, sir. Thank you.

415
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,580
When did you discover
you had a vocation, Fosnight?

416
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,584
- Stop persecuting me.
- I will as soon as you give me answers.

417
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,497
So, what's the problem, Allen?

418
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,829
You're afraid of the cops? I don't get it.
Has the world gone crazy?

419
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,062
How about Harry Milgrim coming back
from the dead? That's crazy.

420
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:25,266
He's crazy. He's doing a job
with a real hard case, Stan Morse...

421
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,038
...who used to not even talk to Harry.
- I want to find them both.

422
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,614
You want me to rat out
Stan Morse, huh?

423
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,481
Who's gonna pay for my funeral,
the police benevolent fund?

424
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:40,112
If you don't help me, there's gonna be
a lot of funerals. Heavy death toll.

425
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,385
This is weird. I feel like
I'm in <i>Dr. Strangelove.</i>

426
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,053
First they talk about civil defense,
and now you talk about death tolls.

427
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,392
Civil defense?

428
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,057
That might just make sense.

429
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:56,400
Thanks. Oh, and drop the habit, all right?
You're not the religious type.

430
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,647
Oh, Barry, I finished the earplug that should
filter the signal. Where are you?

431
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,080
The corner of Waterman and Fourth.

432
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,743
I think the sleep signal is gonna
come over the civil-defense sirens...

433
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,585
...but I don't know where the control
station is. Can you punch the map up?

434
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,655
I could try.

435
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,272
Allen.

436
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,307
Hey, Allen, wake up.
I wanna talk to you.

437
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,176
I'll take a plain one.

438
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,913
Yeah, give me a couple too.
Maybe the nitrates will knock me out.

439
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,681
So I've been going to this doctor.

440
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,259
He specializes in insomnia
and winter depression.

441
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:54,454
Says I gotta just change the hour I go
to bed. Move it up an hour every night.

442
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,929
That might work.

443
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,625
- Yeah, but it takes a month, you know?
- Thanks.

444
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,328
By that time, I'll be having dinner
at breakfast...

445
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,168
...and the late show
will be the kids' cartoons.

446
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,407
Thanks, Murph.

447
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,206
I paid last time, you know that?

448
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,919
What's this? Little late for a delivery,
isn't it?

449
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,722
I don't like the looks of this truck.
How about you?

450
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:29,823
This is Officer Bellows. We got a strange
one on Fifth and Western. Checking it out.

451
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,662
Is this beautiful, or what?

452
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,666
Hey, we better get ready. We want
to get in before the stores close.

453
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,332
- Yeah, we got a couple cops coming.
- Well, let's go say hello.

454
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,875
Hey, guys.

455
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,845
- What's going on, huh?
- Good evening, officers.

456
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,848
Good evening.

457
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,455
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Oh, I can't imagine where.

458
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:05,033
Well, how about a mug shot?
Come on, you got any ID?

459
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,237
Harry?

460
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,068
You must be dreaming.

461
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,955
I don't believe it.

462
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,200
I want the report on my desk
by tomorrow morning at 9:00.

463
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,927
Hey, Allen got out of the lockup!

464
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:44,234
- <i>please report to the corner</i>
<i>of Fifth and Main. Robbery in progress.</i>

465
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,174
<i>The suspect is requesting to see you...</i>

466
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,125
Tina.

467
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,697
Tina.

468
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,493
No!

469
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,981
Barry, I've got it.

470
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,213
Barry, are you there?

471
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,263
My regards to the sandman!

472
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,633
All right, boys, let's fill our pockets!

473
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,215
Barry?

474
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,662
Hey, hey. We'll do that later. Just roll
this thing out of the truck. Let's go.

475
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,400
Why wait? We got all the time in the world.
Blow the damn thing open now.

476
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,544
There's somebody walking around
out there.

477
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,577
That's impossible.

478
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,983
One for each time zone.

479
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,814
"Looters on Western Avenue. Only 10
minutes before sleepers start dying.

480
00:39:54,992 --> 00:40:00,897
See map. Sirens controlled
from location circled. Good luck."

481
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,419
Come on. Come on.
We don't got all night.

482
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,858
There's no more room in the truck?

483
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,898
- Help me get some of that crap out.
- Hey.

484
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,036
- Or maybe we should steal...
- Harry, Harry.

485
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,901
We're coming to the end of the festivities.
I want to be gone when they wake up.

486
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:21,010
The night is young.
These people aren't going anyplace.

487
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,009
Hey, Harry!

488
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,039
Did you hear what your cousin said
about his mice?

489
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,981
Who cares about his mice?
Mice don't live long anyway.

490
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,213
- What, you gonna kill all these people?
- You're breaking my heart.

491
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,324
Listen to me, Central City has a mint.

492
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,087
Harry, we'll take our act on the road.
We'll do them all.

493
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:43,825
It has a gold reserve. It has a financial
district stuffed with negotiable securities.

494
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,331
This is why I never wanted do jobs
with you.

495
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,272
Because you're a wacko!
You know what I mean? You're a flake.

496
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,969
Oh, you think so, huh?

497
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,485
All right. Anybody else
wanna give me an argument?

498
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,067
Hey.

499
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,097
Wait a minute. It's not working.

500
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,534
Go to sleep!

501
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,589
Wait!

502
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,019
No! Not my face!

503
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,397
What the hell is going on?!

504
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,606
I'm running late, Harry.
Why don't you ride with me.

505
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,615
Murphy!

506
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,352
Come on, Mom, five more minutes.

507
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,723
What the hell?

508
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,094
What happened?

509
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,499
That sleep machine came on...

510
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,570
...and knocked us out
with all these other people.

511
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,102
Why...? I haven't slept for three days.
Why didn't you let me sleep?

512
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,394
What the hell was that?

513
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,624
What...?

514
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,598
Look, I'm telling you,
Allen is not in the cell.

515
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,637
All right. All right. Let's have a look.

516
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,865
Mingo, Schultz, come on.

517
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:42,939
What?

518
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,478
Harry Milgrim.

519
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:48,675
I did it. Me. Harry Milgrim.

520
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,286
TKO of an entire city.

521
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,979
Who can say they did that?

522
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:57,787
Nobody can take that away from me.
They'll be telling my story for years.

523
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,293
Barry Allen has taken a powder.

524
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,266
All right, come on, let's go.

525
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,772
You see, it's open.

526
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,239
Lieutenant, what's all the noise about?

527
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,713
Mingo, get this thing open.

528
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,711
Milgrim.

529
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,978
Milgrim, you tell them how Allen
was in this from the beginning...

530
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,884
...and how he killed your cousin.
- What, this bozo?

531
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:31,323
He didn't do a damn thing.
It was me. I did it all.

532
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:35,124
A cop on my trail.
So, what do I do? I frame him.

533
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,733
A criminal mastermind.
That's what I am.

534
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,201
Allen, what are you doing
in Harry's cell?

535
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,306
- Get out of there!
- Yes, sir.

536
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,103
Harry, we reserved your room
for you, pal.

537
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,302
Oh, thank you.

538
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,243
You're welcome.

539
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:54,675
All right, Allen, get back to work.

540
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:04,355
Say, Farrow, do I still get my last meal?

541
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,661
