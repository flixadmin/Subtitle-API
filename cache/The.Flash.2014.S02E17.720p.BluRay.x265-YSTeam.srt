and I am the fastest man alive.

00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,095
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,143
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,274
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,727
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,318
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,362
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,786
I am the Flash.

CAITLIN: Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:31,823
Let me get this straight.

11
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,118
You're the doppelganger
of our Dr. Wells.

12
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:37,128
CAITLIN: Yeah, but that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over by the Reverse-Flash

13

- who was really Eobard Thawne.

Eddie! Stay with me, okay? Stay.

15
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,459
CISCO: Eddie's his ancestor.

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,298
If Eddie dies,
then Thawne will never be born.

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,838
He'll be erased from existence.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,139
Hartley Rathaway. I couldn't have built
the particle accelerator without him.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,557
CAITLIN: Cisco? What did you see?

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,311
CISCO: I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,569
I trusted someone I shouldn't have.

24
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,325
Jay Garrick.

Zoom.

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,405
Just like I trusted Harrison Wells.

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,950
Or Eobard Thawne.

28
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,914
You see what I mean?

29
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,329
I made the same mistake twice.

30
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,998
I thought they wanted to teach me
how to use my powers,

31
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,381
train me to get faster,

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,010
but they didn't come here to help me.

33
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,298
They came to use me,
and take everything I love away from me.

34
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:30,716
But no more.

35
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,349
I'm gonna crack the code.

36
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,885
Figure out how to improve my speed.

37
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,429
I'm going to train harder,

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,099
get stronger, and run faster
than anyone's ever run before.

39
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,894
And then I'm gonna stop Zoom.

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,486
Come on.

BARRY: Oh.

43
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,209
Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet?

44
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,585
No. Sorry, it keeps me motivated.

45
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,837
Well, it's giving me day-mares.

46
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:05,959
This is everything I could find
even remotely related to increasing speed.

47
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,217
How are these supposed to help
apply the speed equation to you?

48
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,973
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,429
I think I found something interesting.

50
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,219
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that word could go either way.

51
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:19,855
After running some comparative data,
it appears that you, Reverse-Flash,

52
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:24,064
and Zoom are moving your legs at,
essentially, the same speed.

53
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,194
Then why are they so much faster than him?

54
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,780
Best I can tell, with each stride,
their feet spend less time on the ground,

55
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,364
thus propelling them forward much faster.

56
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,028
By almost 30%.

57
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:38,246
Great. All right, well,
I gotta make up that difference somehow.

58
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,415
Barry?

59
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,459
Look, after what that monster did,

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,798
I want to stop Jay
just as badly as you do.

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
Right.

62
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:54,759
But what if the reason you haven't been
able to run as fast as him yet

63
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,222
is because you just can't?

64
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,105
Barry, you know what happened to Jay
is not your fault, right?

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,812
Well, I should've known better.

66
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,026
You?

67
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,941
With Wells last year,
I should've learned my lesson

68
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,450
and dug deeper into Jay.

So, their engine designs,
how they increased horsepower,

how many things you could screw up?

00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,214
If Thawne figures out that it's you,

161
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,512
the timeline will be altered,

162
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,017
people can die.

163
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,771
Others could live, and no one will know
who or what will be affected,

164
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,651
but I promise you, when you come back
things will be different.

165
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,855
And only you will know
what those differences are.

166
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,939
Well, if that's what I have to do
to stop Zoom, then so be it.

167
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,701
Because if I don't, and Zoom gets my speed
before I learn how to stop him,

168
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,701
everybody I care about,
everybody in this whole city,

169
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,286
their world will never
be the same, anyway.

170
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,872
I...

171
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,584
Do you really think you can do this?

172
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,377
Yeah, I do.

173
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:44,012
When I went back last year,

174
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,300
and I saw my mom die,

175
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,058
it didn't affect the timeline.

176
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,223
Yeah, but you haven't really
time-traveled on purpose like this before.

177
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,935
I have to do this, you guys.

178
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,768
Okay. Let's go for it.

179
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,228
CISCO: Okay,
you're gonna go back to the time

180
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,196
when Wells was distracted by the return
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

181
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,112
This is the first time we found out
Wells knew the accelerator might explode,

182
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,870
And we were all angry with him.

183
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,579
So, anything that might seem odd
about your behavior,

184
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,367
Wells should attribute to that.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,288
Also, remember,
do not underestimate Hartley.

186
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:18,581
He almost killed you.

187
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,922
This is a tranq dart that should knock
old-you out for about six hours.

188
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,836
Which lines up perfectly
for when you're going back,

189
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,346
because not much was happening,

190
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,053
until Hartley attacks
the Cleveland Dam that night.

191
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,345
So, that should give you time
to learn what you need and return.

192
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,606
CISCO: One more thing, you cannot tell us
the truth about Wells. No matter what.

193
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,272
You must keep the timeline intact.

194
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,903
It's gonna be hard to course-correct
if anything gets altered.

195
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,111
So, get what you need, and come back,
preferably to this moment,

196
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,322
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off

197
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,904
some kind of Twelve Monkeys time loop
you'll never get out of.

198
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,499
- No pressure.
- Yeah, cool.

200
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,957
So, we'll see you in, like, two seconds.

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,543
Time travel's so weird. (LAUGHING)

202
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,802
- Godspeed, Barry.
- I'll be fine.

203
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,220

- What's happening?
- I don't know.

216
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,033
Whatever Hartley's using
must be shorting out his comms.

217
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,943
HARTLEY: I can hear the radio waves...

218

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this.

This could still work.

HARTLEY: About 1900 megahertz.

222

Are they on the other end? Listening?

223
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,125
Will they hear you die?

224
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,124
No. They're gonna hear you

BARRY: Dr. Wells.

263
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:06,293
So, that was quite an observation you had
about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

264
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:10,548
Yeah, just seemed too easy,
taking him down, you know?

00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,707
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,052
Well, likely reason for that
is you're getting faster.

267
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,719
Actually, lwanted to
talk to you about that.

268
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,224
It occurred to me that

269
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,638
Maybe we've been going about
improving my speed the wrong way.

270

How so?

271
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,402
Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved in running,

272
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,815
and I was thinking that there's
just as much science involved in speed

273
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,232
as anything physical or technical.

274
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,245
I just can't figure out
how to apply it to me when I run.

00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,907
Thought if anyone could help me,
it'd be you.

isn't it, Mr. Allen?

Yeah. I've been doing
a lot of reading in my down time.

00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,796
Hey, Barr.

318
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,131
Hey, Eddie.

319
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,509
Any idea what that thing could be?

320
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,842
What the...

321
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,508
No, I don't... No, not yet.

322
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,301
Um, if I figure it out, I'll let you know.

323
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,138
Things just keep getting
more and more strange in this city.

324
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,640
Yeah, they do.

325
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,230
I'm gonna check in with Iris,
let her know I'm okay.

326
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,270
- Great.
- All right, see you, Barr.

327
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
What the hell's going on with you?

328
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,236
What are you talking about?

329
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,989
Look, I know you told Iris
that you love her,

330
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:58,001
but you said you'd moved past
this whole Eddie and Iris thing.

331
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,413
I have, Joe. I have.

332
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,007
Then why were you being so weird to Eddie?

333
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,842
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,130
Let me, uh,
just take care of all this, okay?

335
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,131
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

336
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
Fine.

337
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,351
But soon.

338
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,730
Soon, yeah.

339
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,859
What's going on?

340
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,741
CISCO: Oh, you know, just trying to
figure out how to find this Dementor

341
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,028
that's apparently roaming
through Central City, right now.

342
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,822
I assume that was the cause
of the C.C.P.D. alarm?

343
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,329
Yeah. Actually, it attacked my lab.

344
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,617
CAITLIN: You saw it?

345
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,502
No, I didn't see it. No, I did...

346
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:46,041
Um, well, I didn't get there in time,
but I have seen it before.

347
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,048
Where?

348
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,134
It was earlier today, actually,
when I was running to take Hartley down.

349
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,433
Uh-huh. You'rejust mentioning this now?

350
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,890
I didn't...
I mean, I didn't know what it was.

351
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,977
I thought it was some sort of illusion?
I don't know.

352
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,936
Okay, well we need to find it
before it hurts somebody.

353
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,188
Yeah, can you track it?

354
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,397
What is it with you guys?

355
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,856
It's like you think
I have ESP or something.

356
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,317
I can'tjust magically sense
where things are.

357
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,653
What can you do, Cisco?

358
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,818
I'm thinking I can reconfigure the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to look for it.

359
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,612
It might take some time, though.

360
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,779
Do it.

361
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:18,994
In the meantime, Mr. Allen,
come with me.

362
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,375
Have a seat.

363
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,044
Is this about the speed equation?

364
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,579
Matter of fact, it is.

365
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,423
Great, okay, good.

366
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,925
- So, you've figured it out?
- Mmm-hmm.

367
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,502
(GRUNTS)

368
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,095
Yes.

369
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,055
I figured it out.

370
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,320
Now, who are you?

371
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,286
I mean, who are you, really?

372
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,209
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

373
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,751
None of it adds up.

374
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,541
The interference with the comms.

375
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,461
The speed equation. The Time Wraith.

376
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,765
That's what we call them.

377
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,970
Time Wraiths.

378
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,807
Scary, aren't they?

379
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,471
I thought,
"Oh, no, a Time Wraith has found me."

380
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,810
But then I thought, "No, no, no."

381
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,771
"You know what you're doing."

382
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,188
"No, the Time Wraith is after someone
who's traveled through time,"

383
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,615
"and doesn't know what they're doing."

384
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,653
(LAUGHING)

385
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:43,159
Dr. Wells, come on, it's me, it's Barry.
I don't...

386
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,326
DR. WELLS: Really?

387
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,545
You are good.

388
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,796
You are good,
and I would believe you, except that...

389
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,671
Nothing?

390
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,011
I move like this, you barely flinch.

391
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,305
You know who I am.

392
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,849
Don't you?

393
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,820
On... (LAUGHING)

394
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,778
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

395
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,570
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen
how to phase through objects. Yet.

396
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,739
(LAUGHING)

397
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,204
Let me out of here, Thawne.

398
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,877
I know.

399
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,423
You're upset.

400
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,554
But it does me good
to hear that name again.

401
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,890
Now, onto the bigger question.

402
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,679
Why are you here?

403
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,387
Because I want to go faster,
and you're the only one who can teach me.

404
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,724
You're the only one
who's figured out the equation.

405
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,064
The Speed Force.

406
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,895
You've manipulated it.

407
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,897
How did you do that?

408
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:05,577
No.

409
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,327
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

410
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,621
No.

411
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,550
You'd only come here
if something went wrong.

412
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,595
If you're still alive,

413
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,594
then that means...

414
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:29,935
I haven't beaten you.

415
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,773
If you're still alive,

416
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,115
that means my plan fails.

417
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,036
And if my plan fails,

418
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,824
I don't get to go home,
and if that's the case, well then...

419
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,288
No, no, no! Hey, hey!

420
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,201
It's the opposite, it's the opposite!

421
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,291
You trick me, you harness my speed.

422
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:55,673
We turn on the accelerator
to create a path for you to go home.

423
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,961
I go back in time.

424
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,128
You go back to yours.

425
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,134
You won.

426
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,806
Yeah.

427
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,230
Then why are you here?

428
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,809
Why are you here, now?

429
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,101
Because when I got back,
a Singularity had formed.

430
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,986
And now, the only way for me to learn
how to get faster

431
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:20,275
and stop the Singularity from happening
was to come here, now.

432
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,155
Well, that's good to know.

433

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,796
Just one thing that occurs to me.

437
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:43,429
I don't need you.

438
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,675
Do I?

439
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,182
Not this you, certainly.

440
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:52,513
Oops.

441
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,564
You probably should have thought of that,

442
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,479
before you came back here.

443
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,192
Shame.

444
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,152
You ran all the way back here

445
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,866
just to die.

446
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,035
You kill me?

He learns it all.

450
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,376

Everything.

453
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,388
Anything happens to me,

454
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,345
you never make it back home.

455
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,763
Go on.

456
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,356
Kill me, Thawne.

457
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,939
See how this all ends.

458
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,326

you're gonna help me get faster.

Barry! Doctor Wells!

480
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:39,434
BARRY: Uh, we have to help them.

481
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,598
You let it track you here!

482
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,309
Get me out of here, come on!

483
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,362
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

484
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,567
you're all dead!

485
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,357
Where are they?

486
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,867
Okay. Step back.

487
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:52,693
You'll shatter the glass!

488
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,952
You got a better plan?

489
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,204
As a matter of fact. Give me those.

490
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,615
- (THUDDING)
- No!

491
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,250
Now, Cisco!

492
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,123
What're you gonna do?

493
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:02,546
These cells have speakers
linked throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

494
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:03,704
Yes, and?

495
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,215
I rigged these gauntlets
to emit a destructive signal

496
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,500
if they were ever disarmed.

497
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,219
(SHRIEKING)

498
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,135
lf I can just find the right frequency
of whatever the hell that thing is,

499
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,550
well, let's just say you'll be glad
you're in here with me.

500
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,063
- (LOUD BUZZING)
- (SHRIEKING)

501
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,030
(BOTH PANTING)

502
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,198
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

503
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,579
It's alright, lnky's gone.
I don't see anything.

504
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,171
You know, we'd be toast if it wasn't
for Hartley and those gauntlets.

505
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,797
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

506
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,003
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

507
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,544
Okay, I'm just saying-

508
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,634
So, the two places the thing
has attacked are here and C.C.P.D.

509
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,423
- The common denominator being...
- Me.

510
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,512
Yeah, I know. I Just... I don't know why.

511
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,221
Well, you must've done something
to piss him off.

512
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,228
Satellite hasn't found anything.

513
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,355
We need to find a more permanent solution
to this problem.

514
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,561
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

515
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,689
That's as good a first step as any.

516
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,775
- I got some parts for it.
- Let's go for it.

517
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:12,273
- You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?
- None of us do,

518
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,284
that's why we always
try and avoid them in our travels.

519
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,490
- We?
- Speedsters.

520
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,743
We're not the only two
out there, you know.

521
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,029
This isn't the first time
I've time-traveled.

522
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,869
How come I've never seen
one of these until now?

523
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,704
Because you ran out of luck.

524
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,628
And Time Wraiths hate it
when speedsters manipulate the timeline,

525
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,961
and now that thing's gonna do
everything it can to end you.

526
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,334
(SCOFFS)

527
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,085
Here's what we're gonna do.

528
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,304
You're gonna go to C.C.P.D.,
you're gonna see what you can find

529
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,298
to help us stop this thing,
I'll do the same here.

530
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,011
What am I supposed to be looking for?

531
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,426
You're in forensics, figure something out.

532
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,971
Hey, but what about the equation?
Me getting faster.

533
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,183
If we don't stop this thing,

534
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,816
there's gonna be no point
in me teaching you anything.

535
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,736
No trace elements, no prints,

536
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,528
no sign that it was ever here,
except the whole mess.

537
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,240
Any idea what it was looking for?

538
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,323
- Me.
- What? Why?

539
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,458
It doesn't like something that I did.

540
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,493
And what exactly would that be?

541
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,500
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

542
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,920
Hey, Eddie. Do you have a second?

543
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,679
I kinda gotta go,
check out a lead for Joe.

544
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,713
Okay, actually,
this is for Iris' birthday.

545
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,887
That's two months from now.

546
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,018
Yeah, no, I know, you're right. I just...

547
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,270
Um, I wanna make a video montage for her.

548
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,855
Just everybody in her life, and how her
being in your life has made it better.

549
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,065
That sounds great, yeah.
I'll think of something to say.

550
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,980
Can we do it now?

551
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,739
Barry, I really gotta go do this thing.

552
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:38,823
- I know, I kind of have to get it today.
- Sure.

553
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,080
All right, great.
Just, um, speak from the heart.

554
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,710
Talk as if it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

555
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,872
Okay.

556
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,462
Go ahead.

557
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,845
What does Iris mean to me? Wow.

558
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,681
So, can these gauntlets be salvaged?

559
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,512
Their electron guns are fried.

560
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,223
So, it shorted the wave tubes,
destroyed the amplifiers.

561
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,887
Yeah, but, to be honest with you,

562
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,432
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

563
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:11,271
Hartley would know.
He's the one who did it.

564
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,773
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

565
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,487
But then what?
That thing's gonna come back.

566
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,027
I don't know.

567
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,532
Where is he?

568
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,163
Where's the other Flash?

569
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:28,913
I'm right here.

570
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:42,557
Okay, not how I expected
today to turn out.

571
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,884
Yeah.

572
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,054
- Who are you?
- Who is he? Who are you?

573
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,768
- I'm Barry. I'm Barry. Your Barry. He's...
- Your doppelganger.

574
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,230
No, not yet.

575
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,316
I am you, Barry. Just different.

576
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,859
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

577
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,200
Dude, okay, I've watched Wrath of Khan
with you, like, five times.

578
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,454
Imposter.

579
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,615
Yeah, and every time at the end,
you turn to me and you say,

580
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,955
"I have been, and always shall be,
your friend."

581
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,211
Ah-ha! You imposter.

582
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,461
What is going on here?

583
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,298
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

584
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,837
The tranq dart that Caitlin made
was supposed to last a lot longer.

585
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,132
I did not give him a tranq dart.

586
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,222
Okay, no, yes. Not you.
The you from the time that I'm from.

587
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,471
The time that you're from?

588
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,017
I think what he's trying to say is,
he's from the future.

589
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,230
- The future?
- Yeah.

590
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,487
- The future? With the...
- Yes. Yes.

591
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,947
Are we saying I can time travel?

592
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:43,322
(SCOFFING) One day.

593
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,701
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

594
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,205
But wait a second,
suppose we now change your emblem?

595
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:52,119
Will it be because we got the idea from
this, or, I mean, that would mean that...

596
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,708
Stop talking. You stop talking, too.
All right?

597
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,873
The more you say,
the more the timeline is disrupted.

598
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,666
Now, I'm going to assume
that your presence here

599
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,461
- is the reason that thing is attacking us?
- What? What thing?

600
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,174
Have you ever seen The Frighteners?

601
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:06,807
It's sort of like that, but scarier,
and faster, and it's after you. After him.

602
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,685
Yeah, it's been chasing rne
ever since I got here.

603
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,893
- Okay, so how do we stop it?
- We don't know.

604
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,308
- Then what are we gonna do?
- The one thing we can.

605
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,147
What? What are we doing here?

606
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,115
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation.

607
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,748
The reason that you
traveled back to this time.

608
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,910
And the key to running faster.

609
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,631
Tachyon enhancement.

610
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,540
This was not the deal.

611
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,886
If you think that I'm gonna
hold your hand this entire way,

612
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,092
you're sadly mistaken.

613
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,427
Everything you need is on this drive.

614
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,887
If you follow its instructions,

615
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,349
you will enhance the Speed Force
in your system and run faster

616
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,310
than you ever thought possible.

617
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,482
BARRY: lf this doesn't work,

618
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,442
I'm coming back.

619
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,740
CISCO: Doctor Wells, we need you.

620
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,405
Time to go home, Flash.

621
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:17,712
Okay, our satellite has finally found
our floating friend, and it's coming back.

622
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,838
- You need to go.
- I need to know how to stop it.

623
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,750
- Barry.
- Not now.

624
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,919
When I get back,
you guys have a year to figure it out.

625
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,925
Okay, we'll figure something out.

626
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,424
Cisco, come here.

627
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,394
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

628
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:34,599
Okay. What?

629
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,558
- It's coming.
- You need to leave, now.

630
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,619
Thank you.

631
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,803
CISCO: Barry, here it comes.

632
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,523
(SHRIEKING)

633
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,576
It's not working, it's slowing him down.

634
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,487
Not for long.

635
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,159
No. Barry!

636
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,369
(GROWLING)

637
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,059
(PANTING) Cool.

638
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,572
- It's coming.
- Did you even go?

639
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,581
- The Time Wraith.
- That's a good name.

640
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,958
- Looks like that's a "Yes."
- Did you figure out how to stop it?

641
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,494
(SHRIEKING)

642
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,378
Damn. We thought so.

643
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,724
Barry.

644
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,275
(SHRIEKING)

645
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,076
I suddenly realized.

646
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,532
Low frequency, high intensity.

647
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,240
- I knew that.
- Oh, hey, Barry. How was yourtrip?

648
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:10,009
So, aside from the fact that a Time Wraith

649
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,920
came over here and nearly killed us,
how did it go?

650
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,422
It was interesting.

651
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,887
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that could go either way.

652
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,019
So far, so good.

653
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,556
(SPEAKING LATIN)

654
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,018
How many times
do we have to tell you, Hartley,

655
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,059
ever since evil Wells
got erased from existence,

656
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,445
no one speaks Latin around here, anymore.

657
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,949
Well, as always, been a pleasure working
with you all on this little project.

658
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,155
If you need anything in the future,
call me.

659
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,329
- I'm off to a late dinner.
- Dinner? Anyone special?

660
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,411
Very.

661
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:41,789
My parents.

662
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,420
So? You got me on
pins and needles over here.

663
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,001
What about the speed equation?
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

664
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,505
Well, let's see.

665
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,061
Mmm. Maybe it's password protected?

666
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,606
Are you kidding me?

667
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:10,778
After everything I Just went through,
this doesn't even work.

668
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,791
We got it.

669
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,253
Hey.

670
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,505
- Hey.
- You okay?

671
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,664
Yeah, I'm okay.

672
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,340
Although, it turns out it's easier to find
a two-ton gorilla on this Earth

673
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,003
than a teenage daughter.

674
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,012
I don't know what I've done.

675
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,391
You did what you thought you had to do.

676
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:45,019
You risked your life to save her.

677
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,228
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

678
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,353
You acted like a father.

679
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,983
Like a father.

680
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,692
You know, my wife had to...

681
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,985
She had to talk me into having kids.

682
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,911
Kids, you know, they're small,
they're loud, run around.

683
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:08,585
All I needed was my science,
myjob, for myjoy and happiness.

684
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,039
And then,

685
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:12,873
(SCOFFS)

686
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,128
the moment we had her,

687
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,842
all that I wanted was her love.

688
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,217
Now,

689
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:29,103
I don't know if I'll ever see that again.
It seems every decision I've made lately

690
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:30,733
has backfired on me.

691
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,610
You just have to trust that
in the long run,

692
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,112
you've made the right ones.

693
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,119
- Hey.
- IRIS: Hey.

694
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,626
I put your plate from dinner
in the fridge.

695
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,123
Thanks.

696
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,391
It's been almost a year already.
Can you believe that?

697
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,110
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

698
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,739
The question is, when will you?

699
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,199
I don't know, Barry.

700
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:34,623
Well, um, lfound something
that I think might help.

701
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:41,630
I was putting together this little video
montage for your birthday last year

702
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,422
with everybody and...

703
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,184
Everything happened. Um...

704
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,474
But, uh, take a look.
I think it might help.

705
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,108
Okay.

706
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,362
What does Iris mean to me? Wow.

707
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,820
You know, a lot of times

708
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,206
I have a hard time
figuring out what to say to people.

709
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,286
But, when it comes to you, Iris, Idon't.

710
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,668
Because with you,
everything that used to feel tough

711
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,666
just doesn't anymore.

712
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,510
It's one of the things I love about you.

713
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,713
You don't need me.

714
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,472
You can handle anything on your own,
because you're fearless.

715
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,724
And independent.

716
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,559
Loving.

717
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,432
Kind.

718
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:41,858
You are, without question,
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.

719
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:46,114
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me,

720
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,623
because each day with you is a gift.

721
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,909
So, thank you.

722
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,577
You deserve the world, Iris.

723
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,791
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life.

724
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,208
And no one wants that more for you
than me.

725
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,791
(SNIFFLING)

726
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,552
Happy birthday, baby.

727
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,922
I love you.

728
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,184
I love you, too.

729
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,398
BARRY: Sometimes,
the only way to move forward

730
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,652
is to revisit the things in your past
that were holding you back.

731
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:26,114
You have to deal with them, head on,
no matter how scary they may be.

732
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:31,246
Because once you do, you'll see that
you can go further than you ever imagined.

733
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,420
I'm coming for you.
