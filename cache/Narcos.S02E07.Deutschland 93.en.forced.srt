1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,980
Good morning.

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,860
Good morning, Mom.

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,150
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,780
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,340
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,160
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,040
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,710
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,130
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,090
I still have to buy the books, everything.

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,510
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,350
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,850
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,270
And it goes in the hole.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,480
That was a loud one.

16
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
LLUIS LODOÑO WHITE, SERVILE FRONT MAN AND
INITIATOR OF KIDNAPPINGS FOR PABLO ESCOBAR

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Sit him there.

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,130
Over here.

19
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,430
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

20
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,860
One... two... and three.

21
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,750
This family is the only thing
I care about.

22
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,210
- You're the one that--
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

23
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,510
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

24
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,840
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

25
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,720
Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

26
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,770
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

27
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,370
I would never put this family in danger.

28
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,040
Tell her, Pablo.

29
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,250
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

30
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,840
- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

31
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,470
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

32
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,430
Everything's all right, Mom.

33
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,350
It wasn't your fault.

34
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,670
Look at these smiling faces.

35
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,010
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

36
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,090
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

37
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,890
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.

38
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,730
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

39
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,940
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

40
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,860
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

41
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,110
That is my cocaine.

42
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,700
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

43
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,580
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

44
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,040
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

45
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,000
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

46
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,630
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

47
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,470
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

48
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,350
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

49
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,730
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

50
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,150
We all need friends.

51
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,870
Sir, would you like some?

52
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,480
Go!

53
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,940
Sir?

54
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,740
Are you all right?

55
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,850
Are you all right?

56
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,300
- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

57
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,220
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

58
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,350
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

59
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,190
That's what priests are for, no?

60
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,160
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

61
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,240
But it's working.

62
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,620
Not if I stop providing you intel.

63
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,380
For what it's worth, I am on your side.

64
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,340
I don't like what's happening.

65
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,880
Medellín is my home
and I love it very much.

66
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,090
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go...

67
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,770
well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

68
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,560
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

69
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,190
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

70
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,490
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

71
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,120
I need you to help me find him.

72
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,660
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

73
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,670
What we want is to exterminate this rat.

74
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,510
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

75
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,400
I've told you! You have to--

76
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,820
What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

77
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,990
Juliana... they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

78
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,030
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

79
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,870
Can I see Simon, at least?

80
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,710
- Where-- Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

81
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,710
Simon is at school.

82
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,220
Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

83
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,840
- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

84
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,380
- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

85
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,340
Where's Mom? Why do you have her car?

86
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,300
Get in.

87
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,070
Come in.

88
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,750
Go on, son. Sit down.

89
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,290
So, you're being reassigned...

90
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,210
and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

91
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,840
You'll be all right there.

92
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,260
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

93
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,600
Anything else?

94
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,070
Yes, sir, Colonel.

95
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,130
How are you, Papa?

96
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,310
And you?

97
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,440
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

98
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,690
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

99
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,530
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

100
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,910
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

101
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,620
Do they have Disney World there?

102
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,210
I don't think so.

103
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,190
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

104
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,780
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

105
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,620
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

106
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,660
You have every right to leave the country.

107
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,250
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

108
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,970
Confess. Do you regret it?

109
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,350
Marrying me, or what?

110
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
Not for a second.

111
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,950
They may separate us...

112
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,490
but they'll never be able to destroy us.

113
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,880
Go.

114
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,890
The little bunny.

115
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,140
I'll take care of him, all right?

116
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Give me a kiss.

117
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,180
Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.
at your service, sir.

118
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,810
The colonel's son.

119
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,940
He said you have some
technical background.

120
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,530
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

121
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,200
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

122
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,330
Great. What do you know about RDF?

123
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,300
The basic concept, sir.

124
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,130
The basic concept.

125
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,090
All right.

126
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,970
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

127
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,600
And don't worry.

128
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,730
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

129
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,870
What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

130
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,420
That's Bogotá.
What do you expect?

131
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,840
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

132
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,170
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

133
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,930
- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

134
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,640
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

135
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,600
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

136
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,600
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

137
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,070
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

138
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,950
Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.

139
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,620
Thank the Virgin Mary.

140
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,710
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

141
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,290
One more thing.

142
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,290
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

143
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,010
You tell us. Should we come home or--

144
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,970
No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

145
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,760
I may need you again.

146
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,220
Copy that, boss.

147
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,560
Thank you, Blackie.

148
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,200
Figure out... what time it is in Germany.

149
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,200
On it, boss.

150
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,220
Boss!

151
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,180
Boss!

152
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,670
Peña.

153
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,710
Any word on our friend?

154
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,380
Did you find him?

155
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,390
- Peña?
- Not yet.

156
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,990
What's up, Peña?

157
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,030
Are we getting a beer or what?

158
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,790
Another day, brother.

159
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,750
See you tomorrow.

160
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,560
No. What are you doing, Simon?

161
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,060
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

162
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,400
What are we doing here?

163
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,940
I told you. We're going on a trip.

164
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,490
And what's happening? Where's my mom?

165
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,990
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

166
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,410
You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?

167
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,000
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

168
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,120
That's why this is happening.

169
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,420
You're his lawyer.

170
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,140
What are we going to do now?

171
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,520
I have a plan. Calm down.

172
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,730
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

173
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,150
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

174
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

175
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,370
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

176
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,540
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

177
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,710
You want to call your mom?

178
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,210
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

179
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,050
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

180
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,630
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

181
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,430
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

182
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,640
You didn't complain during the Christmases
or the birthdays

183
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,980
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

184
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,650
But now you're complaining. Very well!
Very well. It's over.

185
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,490
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

186
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,250
I'm sorry... Simon.

187
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,250
I didn't mean to say that.

188
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,550
Forgive me.

189
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,800
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

190
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,240
Was it a heart attack or what?

191
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,700
You fainted, Pablo.

192
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,740
How many of those are you taking?

193
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,540
I've had a terrible headache.

194
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,290
Those aren't any good, Pablo.

195
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,050
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

196
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,600
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

197
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,970
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

198
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,690
Have you ever been to Disney World?

199
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,240
I haven't.

200
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,160
It's beautiful.

201
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,210
It's very organized. Very clean.

202
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,340
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

203
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,880
Stress.

204
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,510
Stress is dangerous.

205
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,100
How's the weed working out?

206
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,060
I haven't been smoking a lot.

207
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,650
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

208
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,860
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

209
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,530
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

210
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,410
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

211
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,080
And that's what he did.

212
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,540
All right.

213
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,840
With you until death, Don Pablo.

214
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,300
Thank you.

215
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,600
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

216
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,980
All right. Thank you.

217
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,870
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

218
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,880
There it is.

219
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,630
This is our stop.

220
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,460
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

221
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,210
- What's going on?
- Can you give me back my passport?

222
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,390
That money is ours.

223
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,520
- Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

224
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,770
That's what they're doing.

225
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,270
They can't--

226
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,530
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

227
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,860
Don't worry, because--

228
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,950
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

229
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,910
Don't touch me!
I'm asking you not to touch me.

230
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,000
Let go!

231
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,300
No!

232
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,850
Fernando Duque.

233
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,390
Javier Peña.

234
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,270
It took me one day to find you.

235
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,110
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

236
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,820
Please... get me out of here.

237
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,820
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

238
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,580
Well, our help isn't free.

239
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,330
We need full cooperation.

240
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,880
Dad!

241
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,250
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

242
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,180
It's all right. Go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

243
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,930
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

244
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,850
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe--

245
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,610
No! No, we're staying here.

246
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,860
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

247
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,450
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

248
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,330
I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you want.

249
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,040
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

250
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,420
Is that a deal?

251
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,680
Do as I say.

252
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,220
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

253
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,290
Hello, German embassy.

254
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,790
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

255
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,010
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

256
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,010
I'm going to shove bombs up your asses,
you bastard motherfuckers.

257
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,890
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

258
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,860
I'm going to kill all of you!

259
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:07,060
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

260
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,770
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

261
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,230
The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

262
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,990
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

263
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:26,280
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

264
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,870
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

265
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,500
and yet you do nothing about it.

266
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,960
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

267
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,760
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

268
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,400
There's a lot of interference.

269
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,360
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

270
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,450
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

271
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,870
To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

272
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,710
Not one?

273
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,790
Not one.

274
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,010
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

275
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:30,760
Let's both start here: L9.329.

276
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,520
There it is.

277
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,570
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

278
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,580
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

279
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,830
Who's your contact?

280
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,670
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

281
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,880
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

282
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,050
We can no longer trust Peña.

283
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,010
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

284
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,260
No.

285
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,020
We can't kill DEA agents.

286
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, no? Why not?

287
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,730
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

288
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,700
Berna, look...

289
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,540
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

290
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,380
We'll take care of the rest.

291
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,490
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

292
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,490
Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

293
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,160
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along.

294
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,380
Did you follow me to the hotel?
You told Berna?

295
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,880
Let go.

296
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,760
Tell me, asshole.

297
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,350
- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

298
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,140
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

299
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,230
What's going on, Peña?

300
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,320
Playing the fucking American?

301
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,990
Did you see what they did to his son?

302
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,910
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

303
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,080
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

304
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,290
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

305
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,120
I understand that you're trying to prevent
Escobar's family from entering Germany.

306
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,950
Let's make something clear:

307
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,630
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only--

308
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,460
No, Mr. President.

309
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,340
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

310
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,640
For me? How so?

311
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,890
I know that you want Escobar dead.

312
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,360
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

313
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,610
But this... this I can't understand.

314
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,700
This isn't just wrong.

315
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,580
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

316
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,210
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

317
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,530
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry to inform you that
your entry into Germany has been denied.

318
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,450
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

319
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,700
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

320
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:39,420
Tell him the children are under age.
We just want to live in peace...

321
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:46,300
No. Tell him that's all we want to do.

322
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,550
To live in peace.

323
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,970
Get the children and your belongs.

324
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,180
Please.

325
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,480
They kick us out of the country and on top
of everything, they keep the money.

326
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,490
I know. I'm going.

327
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,570
What's this?
Why are we being treated this way?

328
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,200
Let's go.

329
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,560
Pardon me.

330
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,810
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

331
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,370
- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

332
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,050
Thank you.

333
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,380
Ladies.

334
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,800
Stop! National police!

335
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,970
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

336
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,720
The attorney general asked us to put you
under protective custody.

337
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,650
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

338
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:29,230
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

339
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,260
How can I help you, boss?

340
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,430
I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

341
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,310
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

342
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,610
I want to see blood.

343
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,660
I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.

344
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,700
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

345
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,210
as close as you can to
the Presidential Palace. Are we clear?

346
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,710
As you wish, boss.

347
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,470
My love, let's go. Let's go.

348
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,230
Do you want one? Yes? How much?

349
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,520
One hundred pesos.

350
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,270
- Here.
- Thank you.

351
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,150
- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

352
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,030
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

353
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,620
Elena! Elena, let's go!

354
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,190
Lift him up carefully!
