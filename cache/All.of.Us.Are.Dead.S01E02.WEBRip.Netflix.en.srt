1
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,489
Hey. Start recording.

2
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,742
Red Cone Foot.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,785
I'll defeat you
and take over as the most powerful!

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,620
Not a chance.

5
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,790
Fuck! It hurts like hell!

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,917
Fuck!

7
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,545
-That's so funny.
-Stop it, dipshit! It fucking hurts!

8
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,175
-What the hell?
-What's wrong with them?

9
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,260
Hey, run!

10
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,720
What the fuck is that?

11
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,555
Fuck!

12
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,728
That's not possible.

13
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,897
Our students turn in their phones

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,774
so none of them could've called.

15
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,442
Yes.

16
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,278
Yes, of course. Everything is fine here.

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,821
Have a nice day.

18
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,036
I told you to make sure
to take their phones.

19
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
I even got you safes,
and they report a zombie outbreak?

20
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,750
-What's wrong with you?
-How can you say everything is fine?

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,085
It's mayhem out there.

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,253
We need emergency services
to get the kids out.

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
Are you the only teacher?
Are you that great?

24
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,591
I told you
to resolve these matters internally!

25
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,760
Get out. Tell the kids to go to class.

26
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,844
But, sir,

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,806
I don't think the kids will listen,
given the situation.

28
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,599
Are you deaf? Get out there.

29
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,769
If you'd go out and see for yourself--

30
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,020
Just do as you're told.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,897
I made you the dean for a reason.

32
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,110
Where are you going?
Stay here and don't do anything stupid.

33
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,654
We should at least make
an emergency announcement.

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,075
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

35
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,044
Hey, you. What's up with your leg?

36
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,797
Hey! What are you--

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,008
Hey! What are you doing?

38
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,677
Stop it!

39
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
Hey!

40
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,031
What's with you?

41
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,658
Help!

42
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,929
Are you okay?

43
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,063
On-jo. Are you okay?

44
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,191
Hey!

45
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,904
Get up.

46
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,950
Move! Out of the way!

47
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,663
Are you okay?

48
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,553
-Stop!
-Let's go!

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,567
Hurry and get up there!

50
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,652
Over there!

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,278
Let's go.

52
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,530
Fuck!

53
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,200
Fuck!

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,090
Get up there!

55
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,174
You go first.

56
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:12,895
Fuck!

57
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,924
Damn it.

58
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,563
Get lost. Fuck.

59
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,778
Cheong-san!

60
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,995
Why aren't you coming? Come out!

61
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,498
On-jo.

62
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,458
Hurry, Cheong-san.

63
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,396
Run!

64
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,157
HYOSAN BUILDING MATERIALS

65
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,422
This way.

66
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
Wait for me!

67
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:39,018
Stay away. Stay away, you bastard.

68
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,485
I told you to stay away, you asshole.

69
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,244
Damn it. What's going on?

70
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,790
Don't open the door. Don't!

71
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,708
-We're not sure if they're intact.
-Let go.

72
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,794
Hurry up! Lock the door!

73
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,003
We need to open it.

74
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,421
Hey, open the door!

75
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,548
Move!

76
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,719
Are you okay?

77
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,096
On-jo!

78
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,975
Are you okay?

79
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,186
How are things outside? Is it the same?

80
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,115
Hey.

81
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,576
-What the hell? Who are you?
-You motherfucker.

82
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
-Your brother-in-law.
-It's Dae-su.

83
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,039
Fuck!

84
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,833
They're fucking aggressive.

85
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,793
What happened to you?

86
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,713
Some crazy jerk
shot a fire extinguisher at me.

87
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,464
-A fire extinguisher?
-Yes, fuck.

88
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,551
What's going on?

89
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,969
Who knows?

90
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:55,970
Guys.

91
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,765
-It's Train to Busan.
-What are you talking about, moron?

92
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,684
Aren't they zombies? It's the same thing.

93
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,228
Why are they at school?
They should be in movies.

94
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,939
Come and look. I'm serious.

95
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,944
Do I have to?

96
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,030
Gyeong-su, the door!

97
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,781
Right.

98
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,743
Fuck.

99
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,870
What the hell?

100
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,246
-Hey, Bare-su!
-Push him off!

101
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,414
-Quick!
-It's Bare-su!

102
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,124
-Get in here.
-You okay?

103
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,667
Prez! Hurry!

104
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,170
-Come on!
-Behind you! Hurry!

105
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,296
Jump!

106
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,508
-Close it before anyone gets in.
-Are you okay?

107
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,475
It's that, isn't it?

108
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,186
Zombies.

109
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,910
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

110
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,286
AMBULANCE

111
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,582
One, two, three.

112
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
What happened to her?

113
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,840
She came from the school. When we arrived,
she was lethargic and was bleeding.

114
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,551
-When was she injured?
-We got the call half an hour ago.

115
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
Why is she unconscious?

116
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,598
She seemed to be having seizures at first,
but she's calm now.

117
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,616
You received your PhD
in cell biology in the US and returned.

118
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,786
You were a researcher
at a pharmaceutical company and quit,

119
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,037
then went into teaching.

120
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,456
With these qualifications,

121
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,876
shouldn't you be a college professor
rather than a high school teacher?

122
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,755
I told you to go to the hospital
and put Hyeon-ju in quarantine.

123
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,552
Why did a teacher abduct a student?
At the school, at that.

124
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,595
If I were a college professor,

125
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,182
a prosecutor, or a reporter,
would you have still disregarded me?

126
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,018
I see. So that's why you abducted her?

127
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,897
Because no one listened to you
or understood how you felt?

128
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,525
You were lonely and sad. Is that why?

129
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,152
Fine.

130
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,738
Let's stop it here.

131
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,782
Who cares if everyone dies?

132
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,660
This world and those bastards…

133
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,922
I can't stand bastards like you.
I hate your kind.

134
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,428
You commit the fucking crime,
but you blame others, society, the world.

135
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,473
Even when you reported your missing son.

136
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,975
"This world swallowed up my son."

137
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,561
Yeah, right. Is this world an anaconda?

138
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,229
Look.

139
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,106
It didn't swallow him up.

140
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,693
Give me a break.

141
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,737
You killed your son,

142
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,533
and you reported him as missing
to avoid being a suspect. Am I right?

143
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
Your son isn't missing, is he?

144
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,581
What happened to him?

145
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,421
My son died.

146
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,472
I put a cat and a mouse in the same box.

147
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,765
MINSONG GYMNASIUM

148
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,934
Most of the mice sat in a corner

149
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,478
and were frozen, trembling in fear.

150
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,524
But once in a while,

151
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,401
there would be a mouse
that would lose all reason

152
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,445
due to the overwhelming fear
and attack the cat.

153
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,366
When this happens,
its testosterone level shoots up.

154
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,786
I extracted that hormone and refined it.

155
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,580
For all the mice
in this world trembling in fear.

156
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,181
I thought that if fear turned into rage,
he'd become stronger than anyone.

157
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
He bit his mother.

158
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,235
Day 17 since infection.

159
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,655
I stopped the haloperidol
and gave him benzodiazepine again.

160
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,533
He'll be awake in less than ten minutes.

161
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,500
You killed your son, didn't you?

162
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
-What the…
-Hold her down.

163
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,648
Turn it off!

164
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,286
Hold her down!

165
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,474
What's that noise?

166
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,601
What's going on?

167
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,562
MRI ROOM

168
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
Has there been some sort of accident?

169
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,401
Please help me.

170
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,904
Call the police!

171
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,441
Damn, that scared me. What's her problem?

172
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,536
Okay. Want to hear what happens
if you keep shooting like that?

173
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,123
Jang Ha-ri, stand up.

174
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,291
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,587
Take a good look.

176
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,090
She's your future.

177
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,801
She's a senior,

178
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,304
but she hasn't won a single gold medal.

179
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,058
Forget making the national team.
She can't even make the reserve team.

180
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,352
She couldn't even pass
the regional qualifiers today.

181
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,938
What will you grow up to be?

182
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,943
You can't get into college.
You can't get onto a corporate team.

183
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,446
You didn't study, so no shot
at the civil service exam either.

184
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,159
Listen up.
Do you know how cruel this field is?

185
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,496
All kids who study that score
in the top 100 get into Seoul University.

186
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
But even if you guys get into the top 100,

187
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,377
you can't get anywhere near the Olympics.

188
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,087
You're just garbage.

189
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,214
Your life is screwed. Got it?

190
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,009
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

191
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,514
That crazy bastard.

192
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
What the hell are they doing?

193
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,487
-See if it's there.
-It's not here either.

194
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,529
Hey, Joon-yeong!

195
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,698
I'm telling you. They can't open doors.

196
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,909
Let's hold it shut for now.

197
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
-Did you find one?
-No, nothing here.

198
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,788
-Damn it.
-Any luck, Dae-su?

199
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,789
Are you okay?

200
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,499
Look over there.

201
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,212
-I don't see any here.
-Here!

202
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,297
I found one!

203
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,927
Whose is it?

204
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,512
This is Yeong-ju's desk.

205
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,971
Oh no. We need the passcode.

206
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,557
Do something.

207
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,392
I just said we need the passcode!

208
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,520
Maybe it's her birthday.

209
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,105
When's her birthday?

210
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't know.

211
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,237
She's there. Give it to me.

212
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,287
SWIPE UP FOR FACE ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

213
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,293
Hold it closer.

214
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,386
You don't need to unlock it
to make emergency calls.

215
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,516
AT THE SCENE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

216
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,522
-Police. What's your emergency?
-Hello?

217
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,149
I'm at Hyosan High School.

218
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,110
Zombies showed up.
Everyone turned into zombies.

219
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,611
You can't say "zombies."

220
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,155
Then what?

221
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,781
They won't believe you.

222
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,617
They're not exactly zombies,
but they're something like that.

223
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,452
Okay. Hyosan High, zombies.

224
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,247
Please state your name and number.

225
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,749
You know there's a fine
for making false reports, right?

226
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,501
This isn't a prank.

227
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,253
Everyone's…

228
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,881
Anyway, come quick.

229
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,090
Okay.

230
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,718
Lee Cheong-san.

231
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,430
Your number is 010-4362…

232
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,224
Stay somewhere safe so you don't get bit.

233
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,059
We'll head out right away.

234
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,730
These fucking brats.

235
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,774
He says zombies are attacking.

236
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,151
Hyosan High, right?

237
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,737
They must be having a festival.

238
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,947
I just got a call about zombies too.

239
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
-Students, right?
-Police. What's your emergency?

240
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,327
A patient is attacking people?

241
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,330
Does the person have a knife
or some other weapon?

242
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,540
She's biting them?

243
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,918
Zombie?

244
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,670
Hey. Call the school and check.

245
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,713
Okay.

246
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,299
Police. What's your emergency?

247
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,011
-What? A person is biting people?
-Police. What's your emergency?

248
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,933
SCHOOL MOTTO
HAPPY STUDENTS, SAFE SCHOOL

249
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,352
CLASS MOTTO
SUN-HWA IS WATCHING

250
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,729
Stay away!

251
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,233
What?

252
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,944
-Where are they going?
-Why are they leaving?

253
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,991
-What are you doing, moron? Close it.
-Okay.

254
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,952
You scared me.

255
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,911
Are they coming?

256
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,080
He said they'll come.

257
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,790
Did they believe you?

258
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,876
What if they think it's a prank call
and don't come?

259
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,087
Call again.

260
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,631
-Tell them to come quick!
-Stop yelling.

261
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,549
What if the zombies come back?

262
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,509
Give me that.

263
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,604
-You've reached the fire department.
-Hello.

264
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,107
Do you know Capt. Nam So-ju
from Rescue Team One?

265
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,609
No. We have many firefighters.

266
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,735
What is this about?

267
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
Oh. Capt. Nam So-ju is my dad.

268
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,491
Please tell him
to hurry over to my school.

269
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,243
-Who is it?
-This is the call center.

270
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,996
You should call his station
if you want to reach him.

271
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
There's a fire.

272
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
-Fire?
-Hyosan High School, classroom 2-5.

273
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,293
The fire is huge.

274
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,980
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL FIRE DEPARTMENT

275
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,986
HYOSAN FIRE STATION

276
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,580
RESCUE

277
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,922
No one's coming, right?

278
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,593
Something's going on at the gate.

279
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,055
Let's call the cops again.

280
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,639
They're not coming.

281
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,184
I'm trying but they won't pick up.

282
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,731
Hey.

283
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,983
Do something.

284
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,361
Tell Ms. Park to come or something.

285
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,947
Do something.

286
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,199
What can she do?

287
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,576
She should be doing something.

288
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,497
What have you done
as our classroom president?

289
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,414
Stop it.

290
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,638
Should I go out?
Go to the teachers' office? Will that do?

291
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,558
Why are you asking me?

292
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,811
You said to do something.

293
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,896
Isn't that what you meant?

294
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,731
Stop it, both of you.

295
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,151
She's saying that
because you're our classroom president.

296
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,822
-Right. You're the classroom president.
-So just be patient, okay?

297
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,702
You guys are… funny.

298
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,703
What do you mean?

299
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,337
Now that we're in this mess,
I'm your classroom president?

300
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,385
We called the police
so we just have to wait a little while.

301
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,762
But no one's coming!

302
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,222
Stop it. We're all scared too.

303
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,224
That's why I'm telling them to call!

304
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
You do it, then!

305
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,353
Hey, guys. Stop fighting.

306
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,689
Who are you to stop us, you fucker?

307
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,524
What? Fucker?

308
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,985
Did you just call me a fucker? Fuck!

309
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,070
-Hey. Stop it.
-Hey, Gyeong-su.

310
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,613
Gyeong-su, let it go.

311
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,739
Stop it.

312
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,033
Hold the door. I said, hold the door.

313
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,327
Who the hell does she think…

314
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,912
-Please stop.
-Forget the door.

315
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,874
-Did you hear what she said?
-Gyeong-su. Hold the door.

316
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,750
Let it go. It's nothing new.

317
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,085
Enough already. I'm going.

318
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,463
-Block it.
-Fine. Seriously--

319
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,552
Mr. Kang.

320
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,639
Are you guys okay?

321
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,606
What about you? You weren't bit?

322
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,775
No. Of course not. I'm fine.

323
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,279
Hey, guys. Let's barricade the door first.

324
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,407
Get moving. Hurry.

325
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,451
It's okay. We are safe. Let's move this.

326
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,494
Like this?

327
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,412
Yes. Stack them high.

328
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,914
High.

329
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,584
You called the cops, right?

330
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,211
We can leave soon, right?

331
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,128
Yes.

332
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,923
What are you doing?
Block the front door and stack it.

333
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,341
Stack it high. High.

334
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,343
Here.

335
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,803
-Stack it high.
-Higher?

336
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,264
Push it closer. Much closer.

337
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,518
On-jo, what do we do?

338
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,560
What?

339
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,437
Look.

340
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,980
His arm.

341
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,361
Mr. Kang.

342
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,071
Your arm.

343
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,572
What are you doing? Block the door.

344
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,910
-You were bitten on your arm!
-What?

345
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,790
What is it?

346
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,041
This isn't a bite.

347
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,752
-He said he wasn't bit.
-No.

348
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,504
I wasn't bit.

349
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,256
It's a bite mark.

350
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,966
I said it isn't. Don't talk back to me.

351
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,968
Were you really bit?

352
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,512
I wasn't!
How many times do I have to tell you?

353
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,306
Then why are you hiding it?
Just show it to us.

354
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,978
Can you please leave?

355
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,772
-What?
-Get out.

356
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,567
You want me to go out there?

357
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,195
After all I did to get here?
You want me to go back out?

358
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,738
You were bit.

359
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,532
Get out.

360
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,160
Get out!

361
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,412
You fucking bitch!

362
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,248
How dare you yell at a teacher?

363
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,333
You little…

364
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,876
Get over here.

365
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,712
Come here.

366
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,880
Come here!

367
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,551
You won't come? Hey.

368
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,011
Hey.

369
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,513
-Stop. Stop it.
-He was bit.

370
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,640
-Wait.
-Stay back.

371
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,767
-Hey, look.
-Let go.

372
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,698
-Are you out of your mind?
-Watch out!

373
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,409
Damn.

374
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,163
-Hey. I think he really was bit.
-Shouldn't we get out of here?

375
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,789
Hey. He's turning.

376
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,418
Get him out of here! Hurry!

377
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,629
Hurry. Throw him out.

378
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,386
-Min-ji!
-Dae-su, wait!

379
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,512
Do something!

380
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,349
No! Dae-su!

381
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,277
Min-ji…

382
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,822
Dae-su.

383
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,408
What do I do?

384
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,619
I don't want to die.

385
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,210
Hurry. Get him out of here!

386
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,935
Cheong-san!

387
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,482
I don't want to die.

388
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,858
Help me.

389
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,797
Stay away.

390
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,216
Get away from me. Get away!

391
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,197
Stop, Min-ji. Snap out of it. Please.

392
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,449
We have to get out.

393
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,494
Get out!

394
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,747
-Get out!
-Let's go!

395
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,165
Cheong-san! Dae-su!

396
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,461
Hurry!

397
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,547
Hurry!

398
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,507
Get out!

399
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,508
Gyeong-su!

400
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,111
Watch your hands!

401
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,660
Hey! Get out of the way!

402
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,068
Get over here!

403
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,700
-Push it!
-Push. More!

404
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,826
Let's go!

405
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,203
We need to turn!

406
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,747
Push!

407
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,920
Run upstairs!

408
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,672
Let's go!

409
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:28,970
Hurry up!

410
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,524
No! We have to go up!

411
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,028
Hurry up! Go up!

412
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
Su-hyeok!

413
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,378
Go to the science lab!

414
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,297
Hurry!

415
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,559
Dae-su! Behind you!

416
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,483
Help me. Help!

417
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,443
Push!

418
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,654
Push!

419
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,617
-Push!
-Harder!

420
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,913
-It's locked. Somewhere else!
-Where? We're surrounded!

421
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,457
-It's locked!
-Shit! What now?

422
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,877
Try to open it!

423
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,462
Can't you see it's locked?

424
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,588
Hey, block that gap!

425
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,090
Dae-su, push!

426
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,883
Push!

427
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,106
Watch your hands! Careful!

428
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,651
Why's it taking so long?

429
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,860
Hey!

430
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,074
-Above you!
-Hey, it's climbing over!

431
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,205
Fuck! I can't hold them off
much longer. Hurry!

432
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,415
Hurry!

433
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,624
It's open!

434
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,127
Push!

435
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,837
Push!

436
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,134
Hurry! Get inside!

437
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,806
Hurry!

438
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,412
Fuck.

439
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,622
Fuck!

440
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,148
Move the desks!

441
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,902
Block it!

442
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,573
Fuck! That scared the hell out of me.

443
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,783
Block it.

444
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,884
Where's the phone? I'll try calling again.

445
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,594
I dropped it.

446
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,721
How could you lose it?

447
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,724
Who cares about that right now?
This is more urgent.

448
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,852
Who are you to butt in?

449
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,649
-What?
-It's because you didn't hold the door.

450
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,610
If you had,
the gym teacher wouldn't have gotten in.

451
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,362
We almost died because of you.

452
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,572
Then maybe you should have held the door.

453
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,741
You're a fucking asshole.

454
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,034
Gyeong-su.

455
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,079
-You bitch.
-How dare you touch me?

456
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,415
Fight after you move these.
This isn't the time.

457
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,042
She's right. Stop it.

458
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,336
Fight after we finish this, Gyeong-su.

459
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,841
This is so annoying.

460
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,858
Where's Su-hyeok?

461
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,193
Has anyone seen him?

462
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,114
You were with him.

463
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,909
He was behind me, but…

464
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,327
Then where is he?

465
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,707
I don't know.

466
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,419
Oh no.

467
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,322
They've all turned.

468
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,701
I think everyone except us turned.

469
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,329
We're outcasts again.

470
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,296
And this is still hell.

471
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,800
I hope everyone dies.

472
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,303
Every single one of them.

473
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,686
You. Shut your mouth.

474
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,349
We should stay here a bit longer.

475
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,226
Right. Okay.

476
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,895
Do you think they're gone?

477
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,564
What do we do?
Shouldn't we go out and call the cops?

478
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,691
We can't go out now.

479
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,943
I'm sure they're still out there.

480
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,157
Who's smoking in this situation?

481
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,452
Who are you to hide in the girls' room?

482
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,289
Be a man. Wimp.

483
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,499
Why, you… Who are you?

484
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,836
Leave her alone. It's Mi-jin.

485
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,796
Mi-jin? Park Mi-jin?

486
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,755
Yes.

487
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,008
Joon-seong.

488
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm really dizzy.

489
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,470
Is it bad?

490
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,974
-What do we do?
-I don't know. It's weird.

491
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,312
Everything sounds muffled, and I'm dizzy.

492
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,648
Ha-lim, it's probably just from the shock.

493
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,651
Let's go to the hospital
once things calm down outside, okay?

494
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,694
Okay.

495
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,572
What is it? Who is it?

496
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,740
Hey, open up.

497
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,202
-Open up. Now!
-Why, you--

498
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,662
-Get out.
-What are you doing?

499
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,997
Don't move.

500
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,749
What's wrong?

501
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,007
-What are you doing?
-Fuck, let go of me.

502
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,383
Mi-jin.

503
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,594
Listen carefully.

504
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,889
You know how to play tag, right?

505
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,435
We're all hiding here
to get away from someone.

506
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,978
But now…

507
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,025
you're it.

508
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,559
What are you doing? Hold the door.

509
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,311
But Ha-lim…

510
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,356
I told you she was bit. Get over here.

511
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,901
Mi-jin, don't do this.

512
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm okay.

513
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,322
Let me out.

514
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,866
Be quiet, you zombie bitch.

515
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,243
Joon-seong, don't do this.

516
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,619
Let me out.

517
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,873
We came here together.
I saved you, remember?

518
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,128
If you let her out, we all die.

519
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,470
Shit.

520
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,474
Get it together. Look up.

521
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,393
What do you want from me?

522
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,146
-If she turns, we have to kill her.
-Kill Ha-lim?

523
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,357
She's not Ha-lim. She's a zombie.

524
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,693
But still,

525
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,028
do we have any other options?

526
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,282
I don't know.

527
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,995
Mi-jin. I can hear you.

528
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,288
I know.

529
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,458
Must you do that if you know?

530
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,876
You're going to turn eventually.

531
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,922
I know. But,

532
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,885
I'm going to kill you first.

533
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,221
I'll kill you before I kill anyone else.

534
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,432
Crazy bitch.

535
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,145
Mi-jin.

536
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,773
I'm so scared--

537
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,585
Get ready.

538
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
I said to get ready.

539
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,380
For what?

540
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,132
To kill her.

541
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,389
Are you going to hold it forever?

542
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,451
Damn it.

543
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,869
What are you doing?

544
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,543
Hey. Why won't she die?

545
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,461
I don't know. Maybe this isn't the spot.

546
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,886
What…

547
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,768
Don't. We're human.

548
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,105
We're not zombies, you bitch.

549
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,067
Hey, I think they're okay.

550
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,193
Zombies don't curse.

551
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,112
Shoot if they turn.

552
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,490
You crazy bitch. We're not zombies!

553
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,454
Students and teachers
of Hyosan High School.

554
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,540
I'm Park Sun-hwa, the English teacher.

555
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,128
Something strange is happening
throughout the school.

556
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,049
Some students are attacking people
indiscriminately,

557
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,011
so please find a safe place
and take shelter.

558
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,724
And if any student
or faculty hears this and is able,

559
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,518
please call the police
and the fire department.

560
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,649
Students, hide somewhere safe
until help arrives.

561
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,361
If you can get out of the school,

562
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,322
please get out.

563
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,657
I repeat.

564
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,452
Some students are…

565
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,964
Guys.

566
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,676
You're okay, right?

567
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,678
You're not hurt, right?

568
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,765
I don't know

569
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,894
what's going on or why this is happening.

570
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,396
Still,

571
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,523
find a safe place and hide.

572
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,241
I'm sorry

573
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,786
I can't be of any help.

574
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,791
Don't get hurt, okay?

575
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,504
Let's stay alive and meet again.

576
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,130
Okay?

577
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,477
Rescue Team Three,
head to Hyosan Hospital.

578
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,522
Rescue Team Four, head to
the accident at Hyosan Intersection.

579
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,440
Rescue Team Two, you have another call.

580
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,901
Fire at Hyosan High.
Please head there right away.

581
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,320
Rescue Team One, report location.

582
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,615
This is Rescue Team One.
We've arrived at the accident.

583
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,369
This is Rescue Team Two. We'll head
to the fire at Hyosan High School.

584
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,498
Accident reports keep coming in.
All units standby where you are.

585
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,941
Let's go.

586
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,831
You little shit!

587
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,208
-What was that for?
-A fly.

588
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,593
You heard from On-jo earlier, right?

589
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,887
She confessed to Su-hyeok.

590
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:06,972
So what?

591
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,892
Go and comfort her.

592
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,394
I keep trying, but it won't work.

593
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,855
Forget it. You do it.

594
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,232
Why are you snapping at me?

595
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,944
What's it to me whom she likes?

596
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,823
Forget it.

597
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,584
On-jo.

598
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,669
Don't worry too much.

599
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,298
I'm sure Su-hyeok will be fine.

600
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,134
He's athletic and super fast.

601
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,180
Right.

602
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,648
But

603
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,025
Cheong-san's acting weird.

604
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,736
He's super irritable.

605
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,908
I think he likes you.

606
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,660
I can totally tell.

607
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,747
No, he doesn't.
He doesn't feel things like that.

608
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,125
He's too busy teasing me.

609
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,973
I-sak.

610
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,642
Why are you so cold?

611
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,269
What?

612
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,190
Your hand is really…

613
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,362
What about my hand?

614
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,456
I-sak.

615
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,794
-What's wrong? Are you--
-No, I wasn't bit. Really.

616
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,424
I mean it. I really wasn't.

617
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,635
She was bit.

618
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,558
What's going on?

619
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,060
Were you bit?

620
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,312
No, I wasn't!

621
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,443
Hey. You're okay, right?

622
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,204
On-jo.

623
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,624
I-sak.

624
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,842
No, right?

625
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,219
I'm not like them, right?

626
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,519
I'm not.

627
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,647
I'm not one of them.

628
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,698
What are you guys doing?
Get her out of here!

629
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,283
Get her out now!

630
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,994
Shit. They're going to climb over.

631
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,871
No.

632
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,165
I'm fine!

633
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,177
On-jo.

634
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,680
Let go.

635
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,061
Hurry! Do something!

636
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,522
Throw her out the window.

637
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,358
No. Let go.

638
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,485
Hurry! She's turning into a zombie!

639
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,614
No, not I-sak.

640
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,339
I-sak.

641
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,718
I-sak, don't.

642
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:17,973
Stop it!

643
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,642
I said, stop it!

644
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,897
Cheong-san!

645
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,285
Have you lost your mind?

646
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,328
-Let go.
-I-sak.

647
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,496
You have to let go.

648
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,719
You want some glitter?

649
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,972
-It's okay. I can do it.
-Go on.

650
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,182
I'll do it for you.

651
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,435
It's nice. Look.

652
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,237
It looks great on you!

653
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,228
Hey!

654
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,875
On-jo.

655
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,355
Come hold this!

656
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,928
Let's go out.

657
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,430
We can't last here much longer.

658
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,598
Where would we go? And how?

659
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,892
The rope from earlier.

660
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,893
Gyeong-su.

661
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,979
Yes?

662
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,107
What?

663
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,610
What is it?

664
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,446
Open it just a little.
Enough for the hose to fit.

665
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,699
Isn't it better to wait
until the rescuers come?

666
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,284
We could all die if we wait.

667
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,411
This might kill us faster. If we--

668
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,705
Is waiting for someone
the best thing we can do?

669
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,207
Screw it.

670
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,835
I've never given my best
at anything other than playing.

671
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:47,844
Did you get it?

672
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,637
Where are you going?

673
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,809
Prez, hold the door.

674
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,734
Help me make knots.

675
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,444
How?

676
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,573
Wrap it and tie it.
So a hand or foot can fit.

677
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,033
Big enough for a foot?

678
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,370
Zigzag. Tie them in a zigzag.
In 50-centimeter increments.

679
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,580
-Zigzag.
-Is this right?

680
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,124
Move over.

681
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,211
Good enough, right?

682
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,174
Let's go.

683
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,019
Can we make it?

684
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,356
I'll go down and check the empty rooms.
Come when I tell you to.

685
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:25,984
Be careful.

686
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,403
Hold it.

687
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,489
What are you doing?

688
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,076
What are you doing?

689
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,745
Go down.

690
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,583
What?

691
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,585
Gyeong-su,

692
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,170
you go first.

693
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,921
Why? Did you see something?

694
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,756
No. You go.

695
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
What's down there?

696
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,427
Just go.

697
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,887
You go, then.

698
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,263
-Go already.
-Step up there.

699
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,306
You should go.

700
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,640
Then you go, asshole.

701
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,017
No. You can do it.

702
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,019
-You can do it.
-Damn it.

703
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,605
But why am I--

704
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,856
Grab it and go.

705
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,984
Rock, paper, scissors?

706
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,652
-Just go.
-I mean…

707
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,697
-Don't be a wimp.
-Hey. Hold on.

708
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,491
Where is it? Hold on.

709
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,201
-Can you reach it?
-Wait, I can't.

710
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,202
Put your foot in.

711
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,495
Oh, I got it.

712
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,121
Careful.

713
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,511
Damn it. Where is it?

714
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,650
Shit. You scared me.

715
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,944
Damn it.

716
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,198
I'll keep going.

717
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,507
I want to go down first.

718
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,511
One person at a time.
You might fall if it shakes too much.

719
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,179
I won't shake it.

720
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,808
-How long do I have to wait?
-Just a little while.

721
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,108
Shit. Why won't it come out?

722
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,696
Gyeong-su!

723
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
Ms. Park!

724
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,156
Gyeong-su!

725
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,075
-Are you okay?
-Hurry.

726
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,785
-Be careful.
-Oh, right.

727
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,620
Cheong-san!

728
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
Ms. Park is here!

729
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,374
Ms. Park is on the second floor.

730
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,543
Second floor? The broadcasting room?

731
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,587
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

732
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,213
Were you with the others?

733
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,882
They're in the science lab.
They'll come down now.

734
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,968
Come down! Okay?

735
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,970
Come down!

736
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,221
Seriously!

737
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,390
What?

738
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,102
Careful. I got you. Hold on.

739
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,647
-Dae-su.
-You're so heavy.

740
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,941
-Dae-su.
-Ms. Park.

741
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,694
Come down safely.

742
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,835
Grab the window frame.

743
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,837
-Grab her.
-Let go.

744
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,881
-I have a cramp!
-You okay?

745
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,174
What's wrong?

746
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,634
Straighten your knee.

747
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,510
-Not my legs!
-Watch out for your neck!

748
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,347
Good. You did great.

749
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,085
Go down.

750
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,006
I-sak…

751
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,549
Get it together.

752
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,928
Who here hasn't lost a friend?

753
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,180
Think of all the people who died.
Why are you…

754
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,599
There's no one left that I like.

755
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,606
There are people who like you though.

756
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,067
Like your dad and…

757
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,657
You have to live for them.

758
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,581
Let's go.

759
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,772
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
NAM-RA

760
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,223
Oh shit.

761
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,794
Hurry.

762
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:18,711
Hurry up.

763
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,213
Grab her. Okay.

764
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,549
Careful.

765
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,608
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

766
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,527
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
