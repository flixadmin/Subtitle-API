1
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tie it off, come on!</font>

2
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.</font>

3
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And lose good money?
Not a chance.</font>

4
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay close.</font>

5
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we are.</font>

6
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on his back.</font>

7
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:53,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up.</font>

8
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

9
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

10
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

11
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is.
Go get him.</font>

12
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'll pay
for that.</font>

13
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, please.</font>

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, no.</font>

15
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it there.</font>

16
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only got one...</font>

17
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he's a fine specimen.</font>

18
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's all?
- Yeah.</font>

19
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That shroom bit me twice.</font>

20
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

21
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomb Bloom.</font>

22
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Once upon a time...</i></font>

23
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>or perhaps twice upon a time,</i></font>

24
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>for you may
remember this story...</i></font>

25
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i></font>

26
00:04:57,706 --> 00:05:00,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil</i></font>

27
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and protector of the Moors...</i></font>

28
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>was still hated
after all this time.</i></font>

29
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...</i></font>

30
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but that was before
she found light</i></font>

31
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in the heart
of a human child...</i></font>

32
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and raised the girl
as her own.</i></font>

33
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love</i></font>

34
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>which broke
that very same curse.</i></font>

35
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i></font>

36
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>For as the tale was told</i></font>

37
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:30,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...</i></font>

38
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.</i></font>

39
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.</font>

40
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the big day!</font>

41
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- Let's go!</font>

42
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up. Wake up.</font>

43
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:55,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

44
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!</font>

45
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you both remember
the secret plan?</font>

46
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it
all right here.</font>

47
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When do I tell the queen
the secret?</font>

48
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be patient,
Thistlewit.</font>

49
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?</font>

50
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.</font>

51
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see what you did there.</font>

52
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:55,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next item of business,
the missing fairies.</font>

53
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've sent more sprites</font>

54
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to search
the Tomb Bloom field.</font>

55
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll report back to me
at nightfall.</font>

56
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will keep searching
until we find them.</font>

57
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.</font>

58
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.</font>

59
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.</font>

60
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.</font>

61
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:27,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must all learn
a little kindness.</font>

62
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through.</font>

63
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse us.</font>

64
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Official pixie business.</font>

65
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A word,
Your Majesty.</font>

66
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe two.
- Aunties...</font>

67
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.</font>

68
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.</font>

69
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not for a moment.</font>

70
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.</font>

71
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...?</font>

72
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinto!</font>

73
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's come
bearing gifts.</font>

74
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:53,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first sap
from the warming trees.</font>

75
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for the big day!</font>

76
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet, Thistlewit.</font>

77
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What big day?</font>

78
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! My crown!</font>

79
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not in the mood for this.</font>

80
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinto!</font>

81
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

82
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

83
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going,
aunties?</font>

84
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

85
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have time
for games, Pinto.</font>

86
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's gotten
into all of you?</font>

87
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Uh-oh!</font>

88
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she goes,
Your Majesty.</font>

89
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back here.</font>

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.</font>

91
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

92
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

93
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip.
What are you doing here?</font>

94
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking for you.</font>

95
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.</font>

96
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.</font>

97
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Moors have turned
to madness.</font>

98
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a castle
full of complaints.</font>

99
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!</font>

100
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to
ask you something.</font>

101
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:40,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

102
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think there
could be a union</font>

103
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between Ulstead
and the Moors?</font>

104
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A union?</font>

105
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To connect both lands.</font>

106
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:50,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To bring harmony
and peace.</font>

107
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been imagining a bridge.</font>

108
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:54,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, a bridge.</font>

109
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, a bridge.</font>

110
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A union's
a wonderful idea...</font>

111
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if both sides are willing.</font>

112
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:04,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm working
on that part.</font>

113
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going to blow it.</font>

114
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him time.
He's warming up.</font>

115
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

116
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your formal coat.</font>

117
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in on all of this,
aren't you?</font>

118
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're busy,
I could always come back.</font>

119
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no.</font>

120
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not busy at all.</font>

121
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, because I'd hate to...</font>

122
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really. All ears.</font>

123
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you
want to talk about?</font>

124
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.
He's blowing it.</font>

125
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.</font>

126
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.</font>

127
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've loved you
since the moment I met you</font>

128
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and every day since.</font>

129
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If love has a truth,
here is mine.</font>

130
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no magic
nor curse</font>

131
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.</font>

132
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure
this is a good time?</font>

133
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Philip.</font>

134
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he's on his knee.</font>

135
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:02,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took his sweet
time about it.</font>

136
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you marry me?</font>

137
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:08,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

138
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes?
- Yes.</font>

139
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.</font>

140
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're having a wedding!</font>

141
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A secret surprise wedding.</font>

142
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course,
we have to tell our parents.</font>

143
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we?</font>

144
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mistress.</font>

145
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

146
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have
a little bit of news.</font>

147
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:18,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, on with it.</font>

148
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nothing
of any real consequence...</font>

149
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:24,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.</font>

150
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just that...</font>

151
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prince Philip has, um...</font>

152
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disappeared?</font>

153
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:33,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
No. Philip has...</font>

154
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yellow fever?
No, wait!</font>

155
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:37,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leprosy!</font>

156
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Mistress.</font>

157
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:43,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...</font>

158
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't...</font>

159
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:48,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ruin my morning.</font>

160
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mistress, please.</font>

161
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay calm!</font>

162
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, tell me, sire...</i></font>

163
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">am I to be a best man,</font>

164
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?</font>

165
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General,
if that's your way</font>

166
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:13,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh...</font>

167
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
she said yes, sire.</font>

168
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?</font>

169
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?</font>

170
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?</font>

171
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Winged beasts,
murderous trees.</font>

172
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guard your tongue,
General.</font>

173
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:27,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know nothing about them.</font>

174
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:29,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...</font>

175
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:33,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.</font>

176
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not like that.</font>

177
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my job to protect
this kingdom.</font>

178
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will do so,
old friend...</font>

179
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without hesitation.</font>

180
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk on.</font>

181
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the gates!</font>

182
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation</font>

183
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the Midlands have arrived.</font>

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weapons.</font>

185
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We have no need of arms.</font>

186
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our days of war are over.</font>

187
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:18,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ingrith...</font>

188
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you see where
I've had you placed.</font>

189
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right behind me.</font>

190
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:26,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's
where I'll always be.</font>

191
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.</font>

192
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One can never be too careful.</font>

193
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty, it's cocked.</font>

194
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:42,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it, now?</font>

195
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Father, Mother.
- Well?</font>

196
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did she say?</font>

197
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said yes.</font>

198
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

199
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is wonderful news. Oh!</font>

200
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two kingdoms united
at last.</font>

201
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:00,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

202
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

203
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I've
been selfish...</font>

204
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">looking at this
the wrong way.</font>

205
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've made your choice.</font>

206
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now is a time to celebrate.</font>

207
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad
you finally approve.</font>

208
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:23,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much more than that.</font>

209
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:28,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms.</font>

210
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She shall come to dinner.</font>

211
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be incredible.</font>

212
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under one condition.</font>

213
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will bring her godmother.</font>

214
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty, I strongly...</font>

215
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will meet the one
who raised her</font>

216
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right here in this castle.</font>

217
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.
The queen is right.</font>

218
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:44,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure
her godmother will...</font>

219
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I insist.</font>

220
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:50,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all,
we will soon be family.</font>

221
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...</font>

222
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:56,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my son
is to marry Aurora.</font>

223
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.</font>

224
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall send word
straightaway.</font>

225
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

226
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming.</font>

227
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:33,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on to your petticoats!</font>

228
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well.</font>

229
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

230
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So.</font>

231
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Godmother...</font>

232
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip asked me to marry him.</font>

233
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor thing.</font>

234
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll recover.</font>

235
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:12,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My answer was yes.</font>

236
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Yes.</font>

237
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:18,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

238
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't really asking.</font>

239
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nor was I.</font>

240
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's next?</font>

241
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll turn him into a goat?</font>

242
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

243
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

244
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:31,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you like Philip?</font>

245
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, for one thing,
he's human.</font>

246
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a human.</font>

247
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:37,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have never
held that against you.</font>

248
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until I fell in love.</font>

249
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:45,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.</font>

250
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.</font>

251
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A very handsome
and charming prince.</font>

252
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:57,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just asking you
to trust me.</font>

253
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please give him a chance.</font>

254
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us prove you wrong.</font>

255
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip is thoughtful...</font>

256
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's very kind...</font>

257
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of what?</font>

258
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...</font>

259
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they have invited
both of us to the castle.</font>

260
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:18,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me
to meet his parents?</font>

261
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a dinner.</font>

262
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't want me
in Ulstead.</font>

263
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why on earth would I go?</font>

264
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.</font>

265
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

266
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip.</font>

267
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you
to wear this tonight.</font>

268
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your sword?</font>

269
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of you,</font>

270
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.</font>

271
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:54,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father,
my love for Aurora</font>

272
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has nothing to do
with politics.</font>

273
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but your love...</font>

274
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will ensure peace
for generations.</font>

275
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now take it.
And wear it...</font>

276
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to know that you will
never have to use it.</font>

277
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my son.</font>

278
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never been more proud.</font>

279
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what about Mother?</font>

280
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she okay with this?</font>

281
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:26,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother will learn
to love who you love.</font>

282
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

283
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.</font>

284
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

285
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm losing my patience.</font>

286
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:46,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

287
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:49,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.</font>

288
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

289
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:54,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora said yes.</font>

290
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all coming together...</font>

291
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:05,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perfectly.</font>

292
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

293
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:18,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

294
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

295
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try it with
a little less fang.</font>

296
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's this?</font>

297
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try the greeting.</font>

298
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How kind of you
to invite me this evening.</font>

299
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember,
it's not a threat.</font>

300
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:45,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.</font>

301
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.</font>

302
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try it with a curtsy.</font>

303
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can skip that part.</font>

304
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She really loves that boy,
you know.</font>

305
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're doing her
a great kindness.</font>

306
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kindness?</font>

307
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:10,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mistress...</font>

308
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't she look lovely?</font>

309
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something for you.</font>

310
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

311
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your horns.</font>

312
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought
it might make</font>

313
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:41,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip's family
feel more comfortable.</font>

314
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, as well.</font>

315
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's a bad idea.</font>

316
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's...</font>

317
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:53,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

318
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:04,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so excited.</font>

319
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm... It's more
than I can bear.</font>

320
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Maleficent!</font>

321
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pitchforks?</font>

322
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

323
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:02,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's getting better.
- Hmm.</font>

324
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.</font>

325
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:21,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

326
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here.</font>

327
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?</font>

328
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:44,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.</font>

329
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at their claws.
They're so strong.</font>

330
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are we
talking about bears?</font>

331
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.</font>

332
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:03,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

333
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look wonderful.</font>

334
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:07,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy
to be here.</font>

335
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora, this is
truly an honor.</font>

336
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:18,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Ulstead.</font>

337
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a beautiful girl.</font>

338
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.</font>

339
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

340
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The flowers
in your hair.</font>

341
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm allergic.</font>

342
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

343
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:39,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.</font>

344
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're beautiful.</font>

345
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Presenting Maleficent.</font>

346
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.</font>

347
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:00,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.</font>

348
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my mother,
Queen Ingrith.</font>

349
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to our home.</font>

350
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:13,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.</font>

351
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't smile.</font>

352
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:21,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.</font>

353
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:25,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.</font>

354
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I have trouble?</font>

355
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:29,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoo!</font>

356
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's making small talk.</font>

357
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll explain it later.</font>

358
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No trouble at all.</font>

359
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:39,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,</font>

360
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:41,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dinner is served.</font>

361
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, make yourselves
at home.</font>

362
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:02,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

363
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:14,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bird.</font>

364
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:18,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Delicious.</font>

365
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a problem?</font>

366
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's iron.</font>

367
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,</font>

368
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she is averse to iron.</font>

369
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had no idea.</font>

370
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it away at once.</font>

371
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?</font>

372
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:54,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?</font>

373
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It certainly is.</font>

374
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoo!</font>

375
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:03,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...</font>

376
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:08,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?</font>

377
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:18,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I simply can't wait</font>

378
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have a little one running
through the castle again.</font>

379
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This castle?</font>

380
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.</font>

381
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will be their home.</font>

382
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:36,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.</font>

383
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir, I do.</font>

384
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes...</font>

385
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:47,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?</font>

386
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:49,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I made her queen.
- Her castle is</font>

387
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quite stunning.
You must see it.</font>

388
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.</font>

389
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:56,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does she not?</font>

390
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:58,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother...</font>

391
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One in the Moors,</font>

392
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and one left behind
by her father.</font>

393
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">King Stefan,
was it not?</font>

394
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:09,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.</font>

395
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:13,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're also
a true princess.</font>

396
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:15,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?</font>

397
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?</font>

398
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both.</font>

399
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.</font>

400
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:28,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I remember
the story of a baby.</font>

401
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A baby cursed to sleep...</font>

402
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:34,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and never wake up.</font>

403
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

404
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would do
such a terrible thing</font>

405
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to an innocent child?</font>

406
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:46,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.</font>

407
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure
your kind would agree.</font>

408
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
my kind?</font>

409
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She means humans.</font>

410
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are fairies missing
from the Moors.</font>

411
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm missing
is some wine.</font>

412
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stolen by human poachers.</font>

413
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the first
I've heard of it.</font>

414
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone gave the order.</font>

415
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:12,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.</font>

416
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she never said that.</font>

417
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:17,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?</font>

418
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty,
I must report</font>

419
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that two peasants
were found dead...</font>

420
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just outside the Moors.</font>

421
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:23,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'd been missing
for several days.</font>

422
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>

423
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we all see.</font>

424
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:29,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The borders are open,</font>

425
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?</font>

426
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?</font>

427
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:38,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...</font>

428
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's talking
about fairies.</font>

429
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contain your animal.</font>

430
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I will.</font>

431
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I didn't know better,</font>

432
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say you were
making a threat.</font>

433
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, do you?</font>

434
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do I what?
- Know better?</font>

435
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough.</font>

436
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:01,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put her down.</font>

437
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:05,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, put her down.</font>

438
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:10,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here to celebrate.</font>

439
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, he's right.</font>

440
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not forget
why we're here.</font>

441
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:20,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The start of a new life
for Aurora.</font>

442
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cheers.
- Cheers.</font>

443
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:31,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent...</font>

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">going against your own nature
to raise this child.</font>

445
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now...</font>

446
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora will finally get...</font>

447
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the love of a real family.</font>

448
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A real mother.</font>

449
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:50,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the one thing
I regret...</font>

450
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is never having a daughter
of my own.</font>

451
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:56,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But tonight changes that.</font>

452
00:31:56,224 --> 00:32:01,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.</font>

453
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:17,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guards!</font>

454
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have opened our home
to a witch!</font>

455
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:30,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

456
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no union.</font>

457
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be no wedding.</font>

458
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:38,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!</font>

459
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent, please, stop now.</font>

460
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John, I'm so frightened.</font>

461
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

462
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has she done to me?</font>

463
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father!</font>

464
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:51,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John!</font>

465
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go home.</font>

466
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John!</font>

467
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a curse.</font>

468
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a curse!</font>

469
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent has cursed
the king!</font>

470
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:08,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font>

471
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:10,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done nothing.</font>

472
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora, we go home now.</font>

473
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:16,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora!</font>

474
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora!</font>

475
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake him!</font>

476
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake him, please.</font>

477
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:02,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand aside!</font>

478
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:05,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the bedroom!</font>

479
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.</font>

480
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:15,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be a lesion.</font>

481
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proof of her witchery.</font>

482
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.</font>

483
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all saw what Maleficent
did to him.</font>

484
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

485
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:27,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.</font>

486
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:32,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All he wanted was peace.</font>

487
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all my fault.</font>

488
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:36,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.</font>

489
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:41,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.</font>

490
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially you.</font>

491
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll do our best
to protect you.</font>

492
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:50,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be a way
to reverse this.</font>

493
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother, could you
try kissing him?</font>

494
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">True love and all that.</font>

495
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I doubt
that would work.</font>

496
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could save him.</font>

497
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.</font>

498
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well.</font>

499
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted peace...</font>

500
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:26,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now rest in peace forever.</font>

501
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:37,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you.</font>

502
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:41,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is no fairy tale.</font>

503
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to return
to the Moors.</font>

504
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:44,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the only way.</font>

505
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:46,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait. Come here.</font>

506
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:47,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to find her.</font>

507
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:48,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the middle
of the night.</font>

508
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:50,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will break the curse.
I know she will.</font>

509
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well,
let me come with you.</font>

510
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:55,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You should stay
with your family.</font>

511
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are my family.</font>

512
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go, Philip.</font>

513
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:02,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe she can save him.</font>

514
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent!</font>

515
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent!</font>

516
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Godmother!</font>

517
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please come back.</font>

518
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not in the Moors.</font>

519
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:31,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diaval.</font>

520
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's seen her.</font>

521
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:36,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy to see you.</font>

522
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's nowhere to be found.</font>

523
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if she
never comes back?</font>

524
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:45,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could be stuck
as a human forever.</font>

525
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to find her.</font>

526
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:53,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the only one
who can break the curse.</font>

527
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:54,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me she's dead.</font>

528
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:58,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The iron pierced her flesh.</font>

529
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:00,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She fell into the river
and went over the falls.</font>

530
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then where is her head?</font>

531
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:07,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was something else.</font>

532
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another creature.</font>

533
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:13,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.</font>

534
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did it look like?</font>

535
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:16,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her.</font>

536
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It carried her
up into the sky.</font>

537
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:23,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out</font>

538
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now she's not alone.</font>

539
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must be ready for war.</font>

540
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:31,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent has
cursed the king!</font>

541
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay inside!</font>

542
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent has
cursed the king!</font>

543
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.</font>

544
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:31,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tried to kill her
with this.</font>

545
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear it?</font>

546
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:52,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hear it?</font>

547
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:55,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

548
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:57,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a message
from the humans.</font>

549
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear it loud and clear.</font>

550
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time for us to die.</font>

551
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:08,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.</font>

552
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we are almost extinct
because of it.</font>

553
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killing peasants
on the Moors</font>

554
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.</font>

555
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've pulled the iron
from the earth...</font>

556
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:20,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.</font>

557
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:21,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this...</font>

558
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will finish us.</font>

559
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:28,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our people are safe
here for now.</font>

560
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:29,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for how long?</font>

561
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:31,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The humans will find us.
They will not stop.</font>

562
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call for war.</font>

563
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call for war!</font>

564
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:39,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now!</font>

565
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:42,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are
too many humans.</font>

566
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:46,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too many kingdoms.</font>

567
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:48,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Conall,
they will keep finding</font>

568
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">new ways to destroy us.</font>

569
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't win.</font>

570
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't win!</font>

571
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:01,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this way.</font>

572
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You're wrong, Conall.</font>

573
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:09,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have something
they didn't plan on.</font>

574
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:13,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have her.</font>

575
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:20,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She holds powers
none of us possess.</font>

576
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is wounded, Borra.</font>

577
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:27,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

578
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

579
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:43,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

580
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You reek of human.</font>

581
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:50,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I was wrong about you.</font>

582
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:52,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead</font>

583
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the bottom of the sea.</font>

584
00:44:57,705 --> 00:44:58,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

585
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:02,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's there, isn't it?</font>

586
00:45:03,978 --> 00:45:05,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's inside you.</font>

587
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

588
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahhh!</font>

589
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:25,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see?</font>

590
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see what's inside her?</font>

591
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is what will save us all.</font>

592
00:45:53,328 --> 00:45:54,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved me.</font>

593
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

594
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me show you who we are.</font>

595
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:04,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're Dark Fey.</font>

596
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same as you.</font>

597
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:20,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all that remain.</font>

598
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unseen here,
far away from mankind.</font>

599
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:26,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>

600
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As more
human kingdoms emerged,</font>

601
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we went into hiding...</font>

602
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from every corner
of the earth...</font>

603
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:36,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doing what we had to,
to survive.</font>

604
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:39,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But many were lost.</font>

605
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a few
generations ago...</font>

606
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our kind roamed
every part of the world.</font>

607
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:09,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tundra.</font>

608
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:10,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The forest.</font>

609
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The jungle.</font>

610
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:18,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The desert.</font>

611
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:26,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, our only refuge
is here...</font>

612
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:28,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this cave.</font>

613
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:30,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our nest of origin.</font>

614
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:37,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.
Play in the wind.</font>

615
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:39,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

616
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:01,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those children
should be soaring</font>

617
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:03,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over the trees and rivers.</font>

618
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead,
they are raised in exile.</font>

619
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:07,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could protect them.</font>

620
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:12,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How? By waging war
against the humans?</font>

621
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:14,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been at war with them
my whole life.</font>

622
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:16,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of them.</font>

623
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:18,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was one you raised
as your own.</font>

624
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.</font>

625
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we can exist
without fear...</font>

626
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and war.</font>

627
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find a way together.</font>

628
00:49:32,548 --> 00:49:34,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That will never happen.</font>

629
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:04,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

630
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:22,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

631
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

632
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:55,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Oh.</font>

633
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:57,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

634
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:07,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

635
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:15,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to your new home.</font>

636
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been worried
about you, dear.</font>

637
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:39,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

638
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:42,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't find her.</font>

639
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My heart breaks for you.</font>

640
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:48,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has brought
a cloud of darkness</font>

641
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">upon your happiness.</font>

642
00:51:50,385 --> 00:51:53,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know she was
against this marriage.</font>

643
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:56,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never trusted your
instincts as a queen.</font>

644
00:51:56,725 --> 00:51:59,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I saw her at dinner...</font>

645
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:03,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with her horns covered...</font>

646
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:07,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bent cowering...</font>

647
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:16,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.</font>

648
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:19,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't know
what to do.</font>

649
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do truly love him,
don't you?</font>

650
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son.</font>

651
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deeply.</font>

652
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:28,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is love
that will heal you.</font>

653
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:32,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what heals us all.</font>

654
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:35,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move
forward together...</font>

655
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:37,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a family.</font>

656
00:52:54,348 --> 00:52:57,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To all who live
on the Moors...</i></font>

657
00:52:59,253 --> 00:53:01,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that noise?</font>

658
00:53:01,423 --> 00:53:03,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...and kingdoms
far and wide,</i></font>

659
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the king and queen
invite you...</i></font>

660
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:07,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to attend the wedding...</i></font>

661
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:10,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in 3 days time.</i></font>

662
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:12,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All are welcome.</i></font>

663
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:13,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

664
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:18,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And all are expected!</i></font>

665
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:22,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!</font>

666
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!</font>

667
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always knew
I'd be invited.</font>

668
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:29,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just glad you two
made the cut.</font>

669
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's getting married?</font>

670
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:43,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.</font>

671
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The queen is right.</font>

672
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We owe it to everyone...</font>

673
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially the king.</font>

674
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:54,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Maleficent?</font>

675
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gone.</font>

676
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:14,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Phoenix.</font>

677
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:16,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...</font>

678
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">evolved over centuries.</font>

679
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:24,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the last
of her descendants.</font>

680
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her blood is your own.</font>

681
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are her.</font>

682
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:37,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...</font>

683
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destruction and rebirth.</font>

684
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:44,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But nature's greatest power</font>

685
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:47,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the power
of true transformation.</font>

686
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:52,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You transformed
when you raised Aurora.</font>

687
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:56,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you found love...</font>

688
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the middle of your pain.</font>

689
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:03,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...</font>

690
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of your pain...</font>

691
00:55:06,948 --> 00:55:09,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not use it.</font>

692
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:12,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help us broker peace
with the humans.</font>

693
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:16,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because peace...</font>

694
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:21,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.</font>

695
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Moors are our last
true nature on earth.</font>

696
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:36,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet you named
a human as queen.</font>

697
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:39,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A daughter you cared for.</font>

698
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:43,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no daughter.</font>

699
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has chosen her side.</font>

700
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:03,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've just heard.</font>

701
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:06,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in 3 days.</font>

702
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:10,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humans will come
from all over.</font>

703
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:12,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when we attack.</font>

704
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:15,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead...</font>

705
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:17,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and their young prince.</font>

706
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their kingdom will fall.</font>

707
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:25,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the Fey will rise again.</font>

708
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:43,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fairies made it.</font>

709
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wore it when I
married the king.</font>

710
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:12,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure it's perfect.</font>

711
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:14,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So am I.</font>

712
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:22,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.</font>

713
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering
how she was raised.</font>

714
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the same evil witch
who cursed her.</font>

715
00:57:27,622 --> 00:57:30,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along.</font>

716
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:31,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a miracle</font>

717
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the poor child is
alive at all.</font>

718
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:36,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much.</font>

719
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:37,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's exquisite.</font>

720
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I'm older...</i></font>

721
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:11,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.</font>

722
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we can
look after each other.</font>

723
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.</font>

724
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:42,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aurora, I know you
better than that.</font>

725
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This jewelry...</font>

726
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:48,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my hair...</font>

727
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all these rules.</font>

728
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:54,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't breathe.</font>

729
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.</font>

730
00:58:57,712 --> 00:59:00,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like
a different person.</font>

731
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:01,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen...</font>

732
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:05,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.</font>

733
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to change.</font>

734
00:59:07,055 --> 00:59:09,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want you to change.</font>

735
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.</font>

736
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:41,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, yes.</font>

737
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:44,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

738
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it work?</font>

739
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:49,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only have a handful</font>

740
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of fairy specimens
to work with...</font>

741
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:52,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the extraction process
is painstaking.</font>

742
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:55,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extraction from what?</font>

743
00:59:56,538 --> 00:59:58,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomb Bloom flowers.</font>

744
00:59:58,773 --> 01:00:00,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They grow from
a fairy's grave,</font>

745
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:01,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">contain their very essence.</font>

746
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:03,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...</font>

747
01:00:03,778 --> 01:00:06,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.</font>

748
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:08,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will need thousands more.</font>

749
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:11,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me.</font>

750
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me.</font>

751
01:00:15,023 --> 01:00:16,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very well.</font>

752
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:20,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

753
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:14,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally,
the Moors will be mine.</font>

754
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:17,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more fairies.</font>

755
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay alert, men.</font>

756
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:12,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

757
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where
I found them.</font>

758
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.</font>

759
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if
the winged one returns?</font>

760
01:02:16,711 --> 01:02:18,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you worry about that.</font>

761
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be ready.</font>

762
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:21,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the Tomb Blooms.</font>

763
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to work!</font>

764
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:41,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sentries, stay alert!</font>

765
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your weapons on hand.</font>

766
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:04,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it!</font>

767
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:14,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent...</font>

768
01:03:57,078 --> 01:04:00,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where
we bury our dead.</font>

769
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've destroyed it.</font>

770
01:04:07,855 --> 01:04:10,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what
the humans do.</font>

771
01:04:10,258 --> 01:04:12,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.</font>

772
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to stop them.</font>

773
01:04:16,931 --> 01:04:20,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You spent years
caring for a human...</font>

774
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:23,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now it's time
to care for your own.</font>

775
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:33,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

776
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:57,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reload! We go again!</font>

777
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

778
01:05:07,215 --> 01:05:09,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reload!
There's another one!</font>

779
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:28,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, stay together!</font>

780
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're about to leave
the Moors.</font>

781
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the hand or the wing...</font>

782
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.</font>

783
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:19,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!</font>

784
01:07:19,213 --> 01:07:21,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.</font>

785
01:07:23,017 --> 01:07:25,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.</font>

786
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm with the bride.</font>

787
01:07:26,287 --> 01:07:28,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind</font>

788
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:29,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">find their seats first.</font>

789
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:30,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not a human.</font>

790
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:32,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm a raven.
- What?</font>

791
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A raven. The black bird.</font>

792
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:37,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. This rice is delicious.</font>

793
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed
to throw it</font>

794
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:40,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the bride and groom.</font>

795
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:43,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? And waste good rice?</font>

796
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the hold up?</font>

797
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:46,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me in!</font>

798
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't humans come in, too?</font>

799
01:07:50,144 --> 01:07:51,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't we come in?</font>

800
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:00,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's bad luck...</font>

801
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:01,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I had to see you.</font>

802
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:04,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you.</font>

803
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Tomb Bloom?</font>

804
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:07,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you get this?</font>

805
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:09,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From my mother.</font>

806
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.</font>

807
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:22,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>From my mother.</i></font>

808
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:12,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where should we sit, Flittle?</font>

809
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:14,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the left.
We're with the bride.</font>

810
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:16,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we are.</font>

811
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:18,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the groom's lovely, too.</font>

812
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:20,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Yes, he is.</font>

813
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:22,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm with both.</font>

814
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

815
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

816
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:58,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?</font>

817
01:11:58,927 --> 01:12:00,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody is allowed in here
except me.</font>

818
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:03,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm already here,
so go away!</font>

819
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:23,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent, please stop.</font>

820
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent.</font>

821
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:33,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't do it.</font>

822
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

823
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before I call the guards!</font>

824
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The missing fairies.</font>

825
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:51,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said get out.
Did you hear me?</font>

826
01:12:51,345 --> 01:12:53,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font>

827
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a pixie.</font>

828
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:01,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you call me that?</font>

829
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...</font>

830
01:13:03,692 --> 01:13:05,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I serve the queen.</font>

831
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:08,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She took your wings.</font>

832
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to release them.</font>

833

<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you do, Aurora.</font>

835
01:13:18,907 --> 01:13:22,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A human who has betrayed
her kind.</font>

836
01:13:29,017 --> 01:13:30,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put the curse
on the king.</font>

837
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:33,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, dear.</font>

838
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:35,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may be queen...</font>

839
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:37,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you are very young.</font>

840
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:40,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated...</font>

841
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:44,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.</font>

842
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was young...</font>

843
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.</font>

844
01:13:53,575 --> 01:13:57,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one particularly
harsh winter...</font>

845
01:13:57,913 --> 01:13:59,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our crops died...</font>

846
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:03,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the people
began to suffer.</font>

847
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:06,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as we looked
over our walls...</font>

848
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:10,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we could see
the fairies thriving.</font>

849
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...</font>

850
01:14:13,395 --> 01:14:18,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.</font>

851
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:21,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choosing peace
over our people,</font>

to do his bidding.</font>

853

854
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:29,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those savages...</font>

855

<font face="Comic Sans MS">creatures who could
barely grunt,</font>

857
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe that.</font>

858
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:36,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our people became fearful.</font>

859
01:14:36,785 --> 01:14:39,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They overthrew my father.</font>

860
01:14:39,621 --> 01:14:43,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.</font>

861
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:48,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.</font>

862
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another weak king</font>

863
01:14:50,165 --> 01:14:52,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speaking of
tolerance and civility.</font>

864

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, my own son...</font>

01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:59,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">corrupted with visions
of harmony.</font>

866
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:01,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But peace
will not be our downfall.</font>

867
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:08,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now lock her up.</font>

868
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A war is coming.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

870
01:15:28,036 --> 01:15:30,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you could be here
with me.</font>

871
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:41,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Conall wanted peace...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we will have our war.</font>

874
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:55,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our fight begins now!</font>

875
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will rise together!</font>

876
01:15:58,066 --> 01:16:00,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fight together.</font>

877
01:16:00,635 --> 01:16:05,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we will show them
no mercy!</font>

878

882
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:52,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.</font>

883
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the music.</font>

- What?</font>

910

911
01:22:20,114 --> 01:22:21,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was your mother.</font>

912

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you saying?</font>

913
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:24,420

against your father.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

917
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:41,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same.</font>

918

01:30:34,943 --> 01:30:35,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

976
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:08,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go!</font>

977
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way! This way!</font>

978
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:12,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

979
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:57,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down!</font>

980
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:01,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not my fight.</font>

981
01:32:01,162 --> 01:32:03,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.</font>

982
01:32:05,634 --> 01:32:08,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.</font>

983
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:28,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.</font>

984
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:52,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way!
This way!</font>

985
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:56,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent's back!</font>

986
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:03,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's going for the queen.</font>

987
01:33:09,564 --> 01:33:11,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yield! Yield!</font>

988
01:33:11,566 --> 01:33:12,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down!</font>

989
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:13,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lower your weapons!</font>

990
01:33:26,214 --> 01:33:29,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the evil
that I promised them.</font>

991
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:35,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your kind is more predictable
than humans.</font>

992
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:42,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

993
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:44,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

994
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, almost.</font>

995
01:33:47,202 --> 01:33:48,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

996
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.</font>

997
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's another way.</font>

998
01:33:53,808 --> 01:33:54,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are.</font>

999
01:33:57,612 --> 01:33:59,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you.</font>

1000
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:01,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not.</font>

1001
01:34:04,252 --> 01:34:06,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I do.</font>

1002
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:08,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my mother.</font>

1003
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:45,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1004
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:03,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?</font>

1005
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:08,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...</font>

1006
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:09,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then use that fear...</font>

1007
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:10,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Majesty.</font>

1008
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:14,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...against your enemies.</font>

1009
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:17,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1010
01:35:17,092 --> 01:35:20,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spread the story
of the evil witch...</font>

1011
01:35:20,695 --> 01:35:24,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the princess she cursed.</font>

1012
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:28,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.</font>

1013
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:31,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were all terrified.</font>

1014
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:34,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the story became legend.</font>

1015
01:35:36,378 --> 01:35:39,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you think
I'm a monster.</font>

1016
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...</font>

1017
01:35:44,886 --> 01:35:47,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did for Ulstead.</font>

1018
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:50,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a traitor
to your kind,</font>

1019
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will pay for it.</font>

1020
01:35:53,395 --> 01:35:55,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maleficent is dead!</font>

1021
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will never again
live in fear!</font>

1022
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back here!</font>

1023
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:09,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ulstead is free at last!</font>

1024
01:36:09,445 --> 01:36:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go!</font>

1025
01:36:20,955 --> 01:36:22,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

1026
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:49,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well.</font>

1027
01:39:50,466 --> 01:39:52,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Beasty.</font>

1028
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:12,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you.</font>

1029
01:40:14,155 --> 01:40:15,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you bump
your head, then?</font>

1030
01:40:16,157 --> 01:40:17,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1031
01:40:20,261 --> 01:40:21,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philip.</font>

1032
01:40:22,096 --> 01:40:23,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

1033
01:40:25,299 --> 01:40:27,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you love my daughter?</font>

1034
01:40:30,171 --> 01:40:31,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With everything I have.</font>

1035
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:41,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1036
01:40:50,559 --> 01:40:53,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe this belongs to you.</font>

1037
01:41:00,436 --> 01:41:02,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Curses don't end.</font>

1038
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:04,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're broken.</font>

1039
01:41:29,698 --> 01:41:31,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It ends.</font>

1040
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:40,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be
no more fighting.</font>

1041
01:41:40,174 --> 01:41:42,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.</font>

1042
01:41:42,744 --> 01:41:44,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And from this day on...</font>

1043
01:41:44,813 --> 01:41:47,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we move forward...</font>

1044
01:41:47,516 --> 01:41:49,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and find our way...</font>

1045
01:41:51,052 --> 01:41:52,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in peace.</font>

1046
01:41:52,788 --> 01:41:54,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Together.</font>

1047
01:41:57,626 --> 01:42:00,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today,
there will be a wedding.</font>

1048
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:03,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just a union
of two people...</font>

1049
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:07,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a union of two kingdoms.</font>

1050
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:08,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all are invited...</font>

1051
01:42:09,638 --> 01:42:11,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all are safe...</font>

1052
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all are welcome.</font>

1053
01:42:48,242 --> 01:42:50,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, there.</font>

1054
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:33,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot live
amongst monsters...</font>

1055
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:42,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone should
really cover those horns.</font>

1056
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only Conall could see you.</font>

1057
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:04,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Borra...</font>

1058
01:44:06,688 --> 01:44:09,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's time to come home.</font>

1059
01:44:15,464 --> 01:44:16,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

1060
01:44:18,433 --> 01:44:20,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you come here?</font>

1061
01:44:30,746 --> 01:44:31,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

1062
01:44:33,815 --> 01:44:35,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you give me away?</font>

1063
01:44:35,951 --> 01:44:37,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

1064
01:44:38,654 --> 01:44:40,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1065
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:42,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you walk me
down the aisle?</font>

1066
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:44,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah.</font>

1067
01:44:46,695 --> 01:44:47,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1068
01:45:10,952 --> 01:45:13,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.</font>

1069
01:45:25,634 --> 01:45:26,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...?</font>

1070
01:45:27,502 --> 01:45:29,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can change her back.</font>

1071
01:45:30,005 --> 01:45:31,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose.</font>

1072
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if we wanted to.</font>

1073
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father.</font>

1074
01:45:41,783 --> 01:45:44,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so glad to see you.</font>

1075
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:46,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've dreamed
of this moment.</font>

1076
01:45:46,421 --> 01:45:49,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two kingdoms
united at last.</font>

1077
01:45:49,323 --> 01:45:52,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's because of you.</font>

1078
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so proud of you.
So proud.</font>

1079
01:46:23,959 --> 01:46:25,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She looks better
in green.</font>

1080
01:46:25,527 --> 01:46:26,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pink, you mean.</font>

1081
01:46:29,898 --> 01:46:30,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, in green.</font>

1082
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:32,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pink.</font>

1083
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:34,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Green.
- Pink.</font>

1084
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:38,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flittle!</font>

1085
01:46:38,807 --> 01:46:41,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's perfect.</font>

1086
01:47:25,554 --> 01:47:27,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go.</font>

1087
01:47:40,902 --> 01:47:43,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull yourself together.</font>

1088
01:47:43,705 --> 01:47:46,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are here to join
two kingdoms...</font>

1089
01:47:46,908 --> 01:47:48,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">divided by fear.</font>

1090
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:51,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, you teach us</font>

1091
01:47:51,546 --> 01:47:54,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are not defined
by where we are from...</font>

1092
01:47:54,683 --> 01:47:56,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but by whom we love.</font>

1093
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:00,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bands, please.</font>

1094
01:48:16,137 --> 01:48:17,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...</font>

1095
01:48:17,973 --> 01:48:18,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1096
01:48:20,675 --> 01:48:21,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do you,
Aurora, take...</font>

1097
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1098
01:48:23,612 --> 01:48:27,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.</font>

1099
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:29,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may kiss the bride.</font>

1100
01:49:00,148 --> 01:49:01,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're smiling.</font>

1101
01:49:24,139 --> 01:49:25,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a new day.</font>

1102
01:49:28,276 --> 01:49:30,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is.</font>

1103
01:49:41,723 --> 01:49:42,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning.</font>

1104
01:49:43,658 --> 01:49:45,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you stay awhile?</font>

1105
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little while.</font>

1106
01:49:47,595 --> 01:49:49,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But don't worry...</font>

1107
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:52,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you
at the christening.</font>

1108
01:50:09,117 --> 01:50:10,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1109
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:12,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1110
01:51:20,121 --> 01:51:21,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh</i></font>

1111
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They tryna shoot down angels</i></font>

1112
01:51:25,093 --> 01:51:27,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They tryna pull
their wings off</i></font>

1113
01:51:28,196 --> 01:51:31,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So they can't fly</i></font>

1114
01:51:32,367 --> 01:51:34,767
