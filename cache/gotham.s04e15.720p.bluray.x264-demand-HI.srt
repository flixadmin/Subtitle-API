Hey.

650
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,308

Yeah.

- How?
- How do you think?

654
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,565
Lee.

655
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,322
She kept you alive
till the medics got there.

656
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,697
Even one-handed,
she's a damn good doctor.

657
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,287
- Sofia?
- In a coma.

658
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,497
Amazing she's not dead.

Harvey.

660
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,299
When I get out of here,
I'm going to confess.

661
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,813
My connection to Sofia,
my role with the Pyg. All of it.

662
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,019
I gotta come clean.

663
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,601
No.

664
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,770
What do you mean?

665
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,740
Who would benefit from that? You.

666
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,528
You get to be the martyr,
feel better about yourself.

You live with it.

670

Just like I do.

671

So, Sofia wins after all?

672

It's what the city needs.

Where's Lee?

674
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,770
She went back to The Narrows.

675
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,901

Oh, I know you'll go.

Just not yet.

684
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,757
