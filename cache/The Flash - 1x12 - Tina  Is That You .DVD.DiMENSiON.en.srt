1
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,457
- Who is it?
- Barry? Barry, are you there? It's Tina.

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,061
Tina?

3
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,162
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,762
It's 2 in the morning.

5
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,371
- I couldn't sleep very well, Barry.
- I could.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,269
I was.

7
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,803
I need to talk to you about something.

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,641
I'm listening.

9
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,786
Well, lately I've been having
these feelings.

10
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,718
You know, special feelings.

11
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,525
Feelings for you.

12
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,792
I've never been able to express them,
but they're there.

13
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,993
They keep me awake at night,
tossing in my bed.

14
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,663
They crowd my every waking thought.
I can hardly concentrate on work anymore.

15
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,539
Barry, what I suppose
I'm trying to say...

16
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,406
Damn it, Barry, I love you.

17
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,450
There.

18
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,592
I'm glad I've said it.

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,291
I... Tina, I had no idea.

20
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,926
Really?

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,263
- I thought it might have crossed your mind...
- No, no, no, I mean...

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,833
...I didn't know you felt
the same way I did.

23
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,568
After all these months...

24
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,836
...we never said anything
or did anything.

25
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,406
Well...

26
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,614
...I guess we better sit down
and talk about this, huh?

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,483
Calmly.

28
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,754
Rationally.

29
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,260
Quickly, so we can move on.

30
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,396
No! No! No, please!

31
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,397
No! No!

32
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,003
- Are you all right?
- I'll be fine.

33
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,578
You go get that hooligan.

34
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,017
Give it up.

35
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,521
- Tina?
- I'm full of surprises tonight, aren't I?

36
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,221
I despise you
and everything you stand for.

37
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,424
But remember, I made you the Flash.

38
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,602
I can speed you up.
I can slow you down.

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,635
I can let you live...

40
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,003
...and I can make you die.

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,234
Tina!

42
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,213
No!

43
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,692
Those meditation tapes
just aren't working.

44
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,927
- Another restless night?
- Try sleepless.

45
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,698
I've had maybe an hour's sleep
a night for the last week.

46
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,534
- When I do sleep...
- The nightmares.

47
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,508
Yeah. Only they've gotten much worse.
Darker. Weirder somehow.

48
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,772
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,543
- Do you want to try biofeedback therapy?
- I will try anything that might work.

50
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:50,155
Okay, I've got a great new machine.
It's meant to be very effective. Take a seat.

51
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,750
What may be happening
is your accelerated metabolism...

52
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,794
...causes your brain to go through periods
where it can't produce the alpha waves...

53
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,558
...needed to relax
and fall into a good, sound sleep.

54
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,759
The principle here is that
if I learn to monitor my brain waves...

55
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,337
...I can teach myself how to relax.
- Except I've modified the process.

56
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,168
I spent three years in biofeedback.

57
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,105
So for me, reaching the alpha state...

58
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,939
...is as easy as closing my eyes
and taking deep breaths.

59
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,948
Now, if I can transfer my alpha waves
to you, it can only improve the results.

60
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,702
<i>Damn it, I love you.</i>

61
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:49,306
I despise you
and everything you stand for.

62
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,819
No!

63
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,029
What is taking so damn long?

64
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:18,133
<i>Dr. Lagro, please report</i>
<i>to the fourth floor nurses' station.</i>

65
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,221
- Mr. Allen?
- How is she?

66
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,452
Well, Dr. McGee regained consciousness
during the EEG, which is a good sign.

67
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,121
The best thing to do is let her sleep.
We'll know more tomorrow morning.

68
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,066
I suggest you go on home,
get some rest yourself.

69
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,829
Rest? That's what started
this thing in the first place.

70
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,836
- Excuse me?
- It's a long story.

71
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,306
Listen, I'll stop by in the morning.
Thank you, doctor.

72
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,618
- <i>Yeah, Maintenance.</i>
- What is with you people in Maintenance?

73
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,917
This hospital is a shambles.

74
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,824
- Dr. McGee, you're up.
- I'm up, but where am I?

75
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,296
Central City Hospital.
You suffered a bad shock yesterday.

76
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,026
There is nothing wrong with me.

77
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,433
The last place I want to be
is this bloody bed!

78
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,267
- Excuse me?
- What's wrong, you got wax in your ears?

79
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,535
- I said I want out of here.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

80
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,738
- What the hell is this slop?
- This is your breakfast.

81
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,611
Oh, tea? Am I'm supposed
to like tea because I'm English?

82
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,912
Why not crumpets
and Yorkshire pudding?

83
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,851
I want coffee. Strong and hot.

84
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,220
- Now you cut that out, Ms. McGee.
- That is Dr. McGee.

85
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,384
I earned my title, Gladys Gillis.

86
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,292
Now, I don't like this setup
one bit, understand?

87
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,195
And I especially don't like you.

88
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,967
Hi.

89
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,371
- How you feeling?
- I'm feeling fine. How are you?

90
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,143
- Great. What happened here?
- Oh, a little accident.

91
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,878
The nurse slipped as she was
bringing in my breakfast.

92
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,224
I brought these for you.

93
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,693
- Oh, Barry, they're beautiful. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,887
And thank you
for rushing me here last night.

95
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,055
I must have had you scared
out of your wits.

96
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,497
Yeah, you did, actually.

97
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,570
There it is, doctor. All over the floor.

98
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,469
I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
That was a nasty spill.

99
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,906
What spill? She attacked me!

100
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,808
Dr. McGee, Gladys says
you were behaving rather belligerently.

101
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,708
I'm sorry if I upset you, dear.

102
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,182
Sometimes I can be a bit crabby
when I first wake up.

103
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,495
Yes, I am good. I am very good.

104
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,029
And so humble.

105
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,463
- Really, you should apply for sainthood.
- Hey, come witness my miracle.

106
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,865
- What was the problem?
- A manufacturing defect...

107
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:36,099
...in one of the microcircuits. The same
board put out the fax machine last week.

108
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,574
Hard to think that a $2 part
put Tina in the hospital.

109
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,474
- How's she doing?
- I just phoned her.

110
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,241
She seems to be okay.
She'll be back in a couple days.

111
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,442
- That's great.
- Yeah.

112
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,816
- So you're on for tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

113
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,854
What is this, a convenient
memory lapse?

114
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,254
Sabrina's roommate from college,
from Chicago.

115
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,985
Another blind date?

116
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,029
Oh, come on, Julio.
Let's look at the record here.

117
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,564
Last month, it was Maxine,
the manicurist.

118
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,931
Topics of conversation were my cuticles
and her snow-dome collection.

119
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,662
Then there was Gwen.

120
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,104
- Divorced four times in six years.
- Okay, so she had a run of bad luck.

121
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,542
Yeah, so have I, all right? No more
reincarnated Babylonian priestesses.

122
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,740
- No more birthday-party clowns.
- Cookie made good balloon animals.

123
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,876
Cookie! Look, I am not that desperate,
all right?

124
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,648
Look, Barry, Lisa's different.

125
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,587
She's an architectural designer.

126
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,626
You've got a warehouse apartment
she could turn into a palace.

127
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,060
I don't need a palace, all right?
But I do need you off my back.

128
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,870
Come on.

129
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:50,104
I swear, Julio, this is your last chance,
all right? If this one's a wash...

130
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,217
...never, ever again.
- You got it. It's a deal, all right?

131
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,581
After tomorrow,
you're on your own, okay?

132
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,450
No complaints.

133
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,454
I must be crazy.

134
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,258
<i>All available units,</i>
<i>burglary in progress.</i>

135
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,727
<i>Fur Exchange on Lotus Drive.</i>

136
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,732
<i>All available units, burglary in progress.</i>
<i>Fur Exchange on Lotus Drive.</i>

137
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,067
We better jam.
That bell's been howling five minutes.

138
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,772
Oh, relax. Central City's
got the slowest cops in the state.

139
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,508
Hey, what happened?

140
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,351
The Black Rose gang.

141
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,650
You ladies are at the top of my list.

142
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,224
Especially you.

143
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,022
You're wanted in three states
for murder.

144
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,226
Nice body.

145
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,263
- Too bad I gotta put holes in it.
- It's no good, Harley. He's the Flash.

146
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,928
He's faster than bullets.

147
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,507
- She's right, you know.
- She's never right.

148
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,553
All dressed up, no place to go.

149
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,118
Oh, brother.

150
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,722
Give me a break.

151
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,733
What the heck is this?

152
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,166
It's a giant fur ball.

153
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,906
I'd hate to meet the cat
that coughed that up.

154
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,802
Let's search them.

155
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,949
All right, well, you're the married guy.
I guess I better do it.

156
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,816
Ladies, sorry about this,
but we're gonna have to frisk you.

157
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,955
Frisk this.

158
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,354
Look out, Murph. Get down!

159
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,426
Tony, you all right, man?

160
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,771
This is Unit 234.
Suspects have escaped.

161
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,274
<i>They're armed and dangerous,</i>
<i>heading north on Keystone Drive.</i>

162
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,811
Do I have to do everything?

163
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,915
<i>Any available units, immediate backup</i>
<i>needed at Fur Exchange.</i>

164
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,850
<i>See Officers Bellows and Murphy.</i>

165
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,149
<i>Repeat, any available units...</i>

166
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,690
<i>... immediate backup needed</i>
<i>at Fur Exchange.</i>

167
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,691
<i>See Officers Bellows and Murphy.</i>

168
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,764
- Pick it up! They're right on us!
- Waste them, Shauna. Shoot to kill.

169
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,610
- All right!
- Yes!

170
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,149
All right! Yes!

171
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,868
- Harley, what are you doing?
- Stop! Hit the brakes.

172
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,266
Not till he's under the wheels.

173
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,855
Harley.

174
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,963
Get... Get Harley.

175
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,626
Too late.

176
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,232
Sorry.

177
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,237
Same here.

178
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,708
Come on, Janie.

179
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,518
<i>This is Joe Kline,</i>
<i>the voice of the city.</i>

180
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,746
<i>She died as she chose to live,</i>
<i>violently and criminally.</i>

181
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,450
<i>Harley Lydon, leader of the nefarious</i>
<i>all-woman Black Rose gang...</i>

182
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,028
<i>... killed last night in a chase with police</i>
<i>after an attempted robbery...</i>

183
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,064
<i>... at the Central City Fur Exchange.</i>

184
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,701
<i>I'm here at Big Ed's Tattoo</i>
<i>on the Central City wharf.</i>

185
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,997
<i>Rumor has it that the Black Rose women</i>
<i>frequented this parlor.</i>

186
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,834
- <i>Any comment, Big Ed?</i>
- <i>They'd come around once in a while.</i>

187
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,475
<i>But I was close with Harley,</i>
<i>if you get my meaning.</i>

188
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,843
<i>I'm the one that give them their tattoos.</i>
<i>You know, the black roses.</i>

189
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,574
<i>But I ain't seen them since then.</i>

190
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,915
<i>You think the death of Harley Lydon will</i>
<i>put an end to the crime spree around here?</i>

191
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,181
<i>I hope that puts them</i>
<i>off the street forever.</i>

192
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,382
<i>I hate to see girls like that go bad.</i>

193
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,723
<i>You know, I'm thinking of coming out</i>
<i>with a special commemorative tattoo...</i>

194
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,762
<i>... in honor of Harley.</i>

195
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,628
<i>I'll be getting one of those.</i>

196
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,904
The Black Rose gang.

197
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,341
I wonder if they're open
to a new leader.

198
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,246
- I just want to get out of here.
- Yeah, well, I just spoke to the doctor.

199
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,947
He said he needs you here
one more day for observation.

200
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,922
Another day? This is deadly.

201
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,352
Tina, what are you drinking?

202
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,862
- Coffee.
- Coffee?

203
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,091
I thought you were strictly
a tea drinker.

204
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,393
Well, I changed my mind.

205
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,229
Barry, I don't think
I could stomach another meal here.

206
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:19,469
- Could you bring Chinese food tonight?
- Tonight? No, I've got a blind date.

207
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,609
Julio set it up. I gotta tell you,
I'm not looking forward to it.

208
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,513
Well, Barry, if you don't wanna go,
no one's forcing you.

209
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,983
I know.

210
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,422
So why don't you call Julio
and tell him you're not going?

211
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,917
Well, I can't very well do that.

212
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,256
I promised.

213
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,955
- We made a deal.
- Look at you.

214
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,363
You're making a fool of yourself
over this woman.

215
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,596
- What? I've never even met this woman.
- Well, that's exactly my point.

216
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,038
If you want me to have respect for you,
call Julio now and cancel.

217
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,576
Hold it. Wait a minute.
We're talking about a date.

218
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,044
What the hell is the matter with you?

219
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,511
You didn't think I was being serious,
did you? I was just teasing.

220
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,085
- You were?
- Yeah.

221
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,622
I'm sure you'll have a lovely time.

222
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,696
- Damn it, I can't believe Harley's gone.
- Shauna, you're making me more nervous.

223
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,805
- Is that possible?
- Yeah, so cool out.

224
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,803
Don't you tell me to cool out!

225
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,173
You weren't tight with Harley.
Not like I was.

226
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,571
We went back to reform school
together, Harley and me.

227
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,344
I mean, we were kids,
we took care of each other.

228
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,457
Holster them, girls.
It's just the lunch wagon.

229
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,869
Now listen, I don't know
how long you can stay here.

230
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,235
The cops keep sniffing around.
Reporters keep calling.

231
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,535
You said this place
could stand an atomic bomb.

232
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,076
You can't take a little heat
from the cops?

233
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,511
Hey, not forever. This ain't
Father Ed's Home for Wayward Girls.

234
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,015
It's okay, Ed.
I can't stay down here much longer.

235
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,917
- It's like we're buried or something.
- Hey, a little respect.

236
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,752
They buried Harley today.
In the pauper's field.

237
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,393
What's a pauper's field?

238
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,791
That's where they put you
when you die an outlaw.

239
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,430
No tombstone,
nothing with your name on it.

240
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,193
You gotta make your mark
while you're still alive, Janie.

241
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,565
Anybody gets in your way,
you send them to the pauper's field.

242
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:31,141
Look, Shauna, let's split town, okay?
I mean, we put enough money aside.

243
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,711
- And we could just...
- No! The Black Rose has a score to settle.

244
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,212
- With who? The Flash?
- Yeah.

245
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,351
- I wouldn't mess with that guy if I was you.
- You wouldn't, huh?

246
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,453
- No.
- Well, this is personal, Ed.

247
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:47,292
I don't know, Shauna.
The Flash is trouble with a capital T.

248
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,622
Oh, yeah? Well, I want him dead.

249
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,821
With a capital D.

250
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,190
Dr. McGee, where do you think
you're going?

251
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,064
I'm blowing out of this hellhole.
Away from your ugly face.

252
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,002
- That's it. I'm calling an orderly.
- You listen to me, lady.

253
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,610
No one tells me what to do or keeps me
where I don't wanna go. Got that?

254
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,301
You're a sick woman, Dr. McGee.

255
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,880
You should be in that bed under
a doctor's care. Sedated, if you ask me.

256
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,314
You're the one who should be
taking a snooze, Gladys.

257
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,112
Oh, I can't remember the last time
I laughed so much in one night.

258
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,420
Yeah. Yeah, I hate to admit it, but I was
actually kind of dreading this date.

259
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,086
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, no, it's just that Julio and Sabrina...

260
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,995
...have tried to fix me up before.

261
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,802
This is different.

262
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,505
A lot different.

263
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,139
So we gonna sit here in the car,
or are you gonna ask me in?

264
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,778
- You wanna come in?
- I'd like to.

265
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,470
Come in.

266
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,516
Thank you.

267
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,201
- Oh, Earl.
- Hi.

268
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,637
- Come here. Come here.
- He's so cute.

269
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,334
Cute? He's too old to be cute.
He's distinguished.

270
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,774
Occasionally.

271
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,644
Earl, this is Lisa.
Well, I can see you've already met.

272
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,877
I always thought you could tell
about people by the pets they keep.

273
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,081
What, I'm lazy, I whine when I'm hungry
and I hog the bed?

274
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,052
- I'll admit to one out of three.
- And which one is that?

275
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,821
Guess.

276
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,600
Would you excuse me for a moment?

277
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,075
- Sure. Don't be gone long.
- Oh, I never am.

278
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,247
Too much garlic in those meatballs.

279
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,108
That's better.

280
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,167
What in the world?

281
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,415
Barry, I'm so glad
I caught you, darling.

282
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,519
Mother needs the invitation list
for the wedding.

283
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,450
- Tina?
- Barry, what's going on here?

284
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,988
Oh, Barry, another one of your flings?

285
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,093
Enjoy it because it will be over
once we have our rings on.

286
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,196
Tina, is this supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

287
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,356
- I think I'll be going now.
- No, Lisa, wait.

288
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,933
Don't tell me,
there's a good explanation for this.

289
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,900
But there is. I think.

290
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,631
- Listen, let me at least drive you...
- No. Thank you.

291
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,707
I am perfectly capable of hailing a cab.

292
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,208
I think you two have
some wedding plans to discuss.

293
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,042
- No, we don't. Lisa...
- Barry, drop dead!

294
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,516
Assuming I'm awake here...

295
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,459
...could you please tell me
what the hell you're trying to do?

296
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,825
I hope you learned
a good lesson here, Barry.

297
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,364
A lesson? What lesson?

298
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,866
You can't go on using me
and treating me like dirt.

299
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,561
You may be the Flash,
the hero of Central City...

300
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,640
...but you forget,
I made you what you are.

301
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,837
Well, this city's gonna hear from me.

302
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,141
Tina, what are you doing
out of the hospital?

303
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,444
I checked myself out.
There's nothing wrong with me.

304
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,915
What are you staring at,
you mangy bag of fleas?

305
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,489
Tina! Listen to yourself.
Look at what you're doing.

306
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,684
- This isn't you.
- Yes, this is me!

307
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,290
Where are you going?

308
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,400
Look, getting rid of that tart was only
my first piece of business tonight.

309
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,465
- Don't you think you should be in a hospital?
- No, I don't.

310
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,664
And you can't keep me there
against my will.

311
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,672
Now, just be reasonable, all right?

312
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,403
You listen. If you do anything
to stand in my way...

313
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,844
...l'll go to every television station
and newspaper in this city...

314
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,917
...and let them know who
the mystery man in the red suit is!

315
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,576
And I'm not talking about
bloody Father Christmas!

316
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,456
Bloody?

317
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,709
Mama.

318
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,788
The stuff on the wall
is strictly for tourists.

319
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,755
You have lovely skin.

320
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,588
A canvas like that deserves the classics.

321
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,354
How about Venus on the half shell?

322
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,432
- I was thinking of a rose.
- A nice English rose.

323
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,331
- And I know just where I'd like to put it.
- A black rose.

324
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,735
- I want information.
- You want information, try 411.

325
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,102
They can't tell me
where the Black Rose gang is.

326
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,608
You don't want an illustration,
leave the premises.

327
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,439
I already told the cops all I know.

328
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,742
Look, I can offer you something
the cops can't.

329
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,485
What would that be?

330
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,585
Your life.

331
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,521
<i>Central City is quiet tonight</i>
<i>as police widen the dragnet...</i>

332
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,854
<i>... in their search for</i>
<i>the remaining members...</i>

333
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,465
- Turn that clown off!
- <i>Shauna Duke and Janie Jones</i>...

334
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,641
- What are you doing?
- You can stay here...

335
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,369
...and pay back Harley if you want,
but I can't take it.

336
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,946
Holed up like a couple
of scared animals.

337
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,983
You wanna leave? Go.
But who is gonna watch your back?

338
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
- Who is this, Ed?
- What does it look like?

339
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,784
A lady with a gun in my back.

340
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,358
Drop it, or I'll blow your head
across the room.

341
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,190
That would be a stupid move. You need me.
Together we can tear this city apart.

342
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,697
I don't believe this.
A Black Rose wannabe.

343
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,503
You ran into bad luck the other night.
I'm here to change that.

344
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,537
Oh, yeah, bad luck.

345
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,800
- In a red suit.
- The Flash?

346
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,467
If it wasn't for him,
Harley would still be alive.

347
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,011
Work with me,
and you won't worry about him again.

348
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,912
- What can you do?
- I can do anything I want to him.

349
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,551
I can speed him up.
I can slow him down.

350
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,814
I can let him live...

351
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,793
...or I can make him die.

352
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,201
<i>This is Tina.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

353
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,700
Tina, yeah, it's me.

354
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,672
This is the 10th time I've called.

355
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,738
Please call me. I need to talk to you.

356
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,610
Still no sign of her?

357
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:02,378
No, no. I've been to her house,
I've been to the lab...

358
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,818
I don't know, you know, that accident
with the biofeedback machine...

359
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,516
...I think it's altered her personality
or something.

360
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,025
- I'm worried about her.
- Yeah, it's a little scary.

361
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,823
It's a lot scary, Julio.

362
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,989
So, what was in that package
she sent you?

363
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,599
What package?

364
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,534
- The one I put on your desk for you.
- Oh, this package.

365
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,543
<i>Barry, I really hate to have</i>
<i>to talk to you like this...</i>

366
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,185
<i>... but I'm too embarrassed</i>
<i>to return your phone calls.</i>

367
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,322
<i>I'm sorry about behaving</i>
<i>so horribly last night.</i>

368
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,651
<i>But you must realize</i>
<i>that wasn't me talking.</i>

369
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,588
<i>Not the me you know anyway.</i>

370
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,353
<i>I spoke to Dr. Whilhite.</i>

371
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,157
<i>He says I should go away</i>
<i>for a couple of weeks and rest.</i>

372
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,562
<i>By the time you get this,</i>
<i>I'll be at my sister's.</i>

373
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,601
<i>Barry, I hope I didn't ruin anything</i>
<i>between you and Lisa.</i>

374
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,468
<i>And if she's still talking to you,</i>
<i>please give her my apologies as well.</i>

375
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,768
<i>I hope you can forgive me, Barry.</i>

376
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,036
<i>I'll make it up to you. I promise.</i>

377
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,340
<i>Well, see you soon, okay?</i>

378
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,813
<i>Bye.</i>

379
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,145
Great. So now you know where she is.

380
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,378
Just call her sister's.

381
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,522
It's not that easy. Her sister...

382
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,423
...lives upstate. No phone.

383
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,329
- Well, Tina seemed fine on the tape.
- I know. You didn't see her at my place.

384
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,661
She burst in,
she kissed me full on the mouth...

385
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,134
...she wrecked my evening with Lisa,
and it was...

386
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,832
...like she was getting some kind
of perverse pleasure out of it.

387
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,477
Look, I know you're concerned
about Tina, all right?

388
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,169
But I'm sure she's gonna be fine.

389
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,110
Besides, there's nothing
you can do about it, right?

390
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,284
- Right.
- Right.

391
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,718
So I had Sabrina call Lisa...

392
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,154
...and explain to her that you and Tina
aren't planning a June wedding.

393
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,227
Therefore, Lisa has agreed
to meet your raggedy self...

394
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,423
...at Carlos and Toshiro's
at 1 p.m. Sharp.

395
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,296
I'm now going to cover my head
for your assault. Thank you.

396
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,463
Julio, for once you have my permission
to meddle, okay?

397
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,140
I'll be there.

398
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,834
Now remember, once we're inside,
kill the power quick.

399
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,876
Then we have a chance
to beat the alarm.

400
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,447
Listen, McGee,
don't get comfortable giving orders.

401
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,380
You're nothing but a grunt
till you pass your audition.

402
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,613
And if you don't pass your audition,
I guess we'll just have to kill you.

403
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,426
Hi. In spite of what you heard,
I don't have eight children in Pittsburgh...

404
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,765
...l'm not after your money
and I don't eat broken glass for breakfast.

405
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,836
Well, then I guess
we have nothing in common.

406
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,940
Listen, I'm really sorry
about last night, okay?

407
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,547
Oh, me too.

408
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,514
I should have given you a chance
to explain.

409
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,718
Okay, well, since we've both offered
our humble apologies...

410
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,485
...how about you and I pick up
where we left off?

411
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,457
- Yeah?
- Okay.

412
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,223
Because where we left off
was getting pretty interesting.

413
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,367
I promise, nothing
is gonna interrupt us this time.

414
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,405
Except a bank robbery.

415
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,272
- Go inside, call the police. Stay there...
- No, Barry, wait a second.

416
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,434
I'm fine.

417
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,642
Nobody move. You twitch, you die!

418
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,656
Fill the bag!

419
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,192
Fill the bag!

420
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,567
- Did you see that?
- Just grab the money!

421
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,862
Oh, my bag's full,
I'm getting out of here.

422
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,938
Janie!

423
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,834
You roses need pruning.

424
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,109
Flash, watch out!

425
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,220
Let's go!

426
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,200
- My God, what have they done to me?
- Hey, Flash, go get them!

427
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,707
Mom, he's a fake.

428
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,598
Stop the car! We need a hostage.

429
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:47,028
- No! You guys, no!
- You're coming with us!

430
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,035
Let's go!

431
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:06,286
I don't know what this is about,
but I have friends in the Central City P.D.

432
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,822
Like Barry Allen?

433
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,460
- Tina.
- Oh, she remembers names too.

434
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,426
- What is this?
- This is called a kidnapping.

435
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,088
Any more stupid questions?

436
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,731
I have heard of jealous women,
but this is crazy.

437
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,669
- Crazy? Are you calling me crazy?
- No. No.

438
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,400
Tina, listen to me, I just met Barry.

439
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,374
To be honest with you,
I have no interest in him at all.

440
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,014
As a matter of fact, I find him...
I despise him.

441
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,878
- Oh, really?
- Yes. I think he's boring.

442
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,143
He's dull, he's obnoxious.

443
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,222
Just let me go, I'll forget
this whole thing ever happened.

444
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,325
Oh, so now I'm not only crazy,
but I have bad taste in men too.

445
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,326
The way you slowed down the Flash,
that was really good, Tina.

446
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,830
Thanks. Ink your pen up, Ed.
I'm ready for the black rose.

447
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,696
Yeah, but this time, I get to choose
the place where it goes.

448
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,998
- Right, girls?
- Wait a minute.

449
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:00,201
She only made the Flash drowsy.
I want him asleep for good.

450
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,245
Till then, you don't get any skin art.
Understand?

451
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,177
Fair enough.

452
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,944
Killing the Flash will be easy now
that we have the bait.

453
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,781
- What kind of bait is she?
- She's a friend of the Flash.

454
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,217
A good friend.

455
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,381
- How do you know?
- I know.

456
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,754
That's why you need me.

457
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,033
Bingo.

458
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,665
- Any luck on the dart?
- Yeah, I just ID'd the contents.

459
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,004
It's a superconcentrated form
of insulin.

460
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,510
An injection would case a rapid
but brief slowdown.

461
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,115
Witnesses claim the Flash
tried to stop the robbery.

462
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:43,014
My theory is that whoever this
new member of the Black Rose gang is...

463
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,520
...has figured a way to slow him down,
at least for a couple of minutes.

464
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,183
- Any luck on the prints on the gun?
- I got two good ones right here.

465
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,429
Great, that's perfect.

466
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,395
Look, do you mind if I go to Sabrina's?
She's real upset about Lisa.

467
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,700
No, go ahead. Go ahead.
I'll stay here and run the prints.

468
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,736
- Are you doing city, state or federal?
- All of them.

469
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,674
- That'll take all night.
- Yeah, I know.

470
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,049
Well, all right. If anything comes up,
call me, okay?

471
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,649
You bet.

472
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,687
My God.

473
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,360
Tina.

474
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,672
- Crime lab.
- <i>Listen, Barry, and listen well.</i>

475
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,577
Tina, where are you? What's going on?

476
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,718
<i>What's going on is we've got Lisa</i>
<i>and she's getting on my nerves.</i>

477
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,151
- "We"? Who's "we"?
- <i>Look, that's none of your concern.</i>

478
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,656
<i>If you wanna see her alive, come</i>
<i>to the old Central City power building.</i>

479
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,987
Don't do anything
until I get there, all right?

480
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,528
<i>I'm warning you, Barry. Do as I say...</i>

481
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,826
<i>... unless you wanna see your girlfriend</i>
<i>disappear forever.</i>

482
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,332
Tina!

483
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:44,069
Let's get ready. He'll be here in a second,
and I mean that.

484
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,149
Okay, I'm here.

485
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,187
Now what?

486
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,324
I keep telling you guys,
he can outrun bullets.

487
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,700
Tina, listen to me. Listen to me!

488
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,033
Remember the biofeedback machine,
the accident. Something happened.

489
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,437
You are living out my nightmares.

490
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,271
You've got to let me help you
get back to normal.

491
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,470
What is normal? You?

492
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,878
That's a laugh, running
around in your red suit.

493
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,517
Why are you so worried about me?

494
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,143
- You have a new love in your life.
- You don't even know what you're saying.

495
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,752
This isn't the real Tina.

496
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,087
But she's still inside you.

497
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,126
Well, maybe I don't want her there.

498
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,822
If we don't end this,
someone could get hurt or killed!

499
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,025
Is that what you want? Is it?

500
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,434
No.

501
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:53,065
Of course not, Barry. I'm so sorry.
What have I been doing?

502
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,678
How could I have said and done
such horrible things?

503
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,404
It's okay, all right?

504
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,380
Now just take me to Lisa, okay?

505
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,510
- Yeah.
- So I can get the two of you out of here.

506
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,155
Okay.

507
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,887
She's in here.
Don't worry, we didn't harm her.

508
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,587
I know.

509
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,197
So long, sucker!

510
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,166
You wanted the Flash,
you got the Flash.

511
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,604
- Yeah.
- Tina, I think you've earned your rose.

512
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,741
I read about you in the Chicago paper.

513
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,546
- No one was sure you really existed.
- They're not really sure here either.

514
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,417
It's no use. They ripped out the phone.

515
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,046
Come on, let's get going.
We gotta get our stuff to Big Ed's.

516
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,243
I wanna get out of town tonight.

517
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,781
She said something about Big Ed's.

518
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,323
The tattoo place on Lydia Drive.
Yes!

519
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,393
Get out of this stuff. It'll kill you.

520
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,257
It'll put them out of their misery
in a few minutes.

521
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,492
Call 9ll.

522
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,711
We have an emergency
at the powerhouse in Helltown.

523
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,711
We need police
and paramedics now.

524
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,374
- Big Ed's.
- Please send police to Big Ed's on Lydia.

525
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,350
Tattoo parlor, yes.
Thank you. Please hurry.

526
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,528
Non-lethal.

527
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,465
Wait here for the police.

528
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:47,045
Step on it, Ed.
I wanna be in St. Louis by dawn.

529
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,550
You think when Rembrandt
was doing the <i>Mona Lisa</i>...

530
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,621
...he had chicks bugging him to hurry up?
- <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

531
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,918
You mean that stripper in Helltown.

532
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,288
- You like it?
- Love it.

533
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,659
It should have been more
three-dimensional.

534
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:07,031
You know, I needed a more sculptured,
round surface.

535
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,741
I wish you chicks
weren't blowing town.

536
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,606
I'm gonna miss you.

537
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,578
Look at this. I'm getting misty-eyed.

538
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,147
- What was that?
- Someone up top.

539
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,048
I'll ring the buzzer
when I get rid of them.

540
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,487
What do you want?

541
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,524
The Black Rose gang. Where are they?

542
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,334
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,507
So unless you want one of those
added to your chest...

544
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,269
...you'll tell me where they are.

545
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,916
That's Ed's signal. All clear up top.
Let's split.

546
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,881
You go ahead.
I've got things to pack.

547
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,918
- I'll be up in a minute.
- All right.

548
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,587
Tina, you've been a very bad girl.

549
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,659
- Let me go!
- It's time to tame the shrew!

550
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,197
It's him. Step on it.

551
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,475
Let go of me! Put me down!

552
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,788
All right, get out of the car!

553
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,982
- Put your hands up.
- A little car trouble, ladies?

554
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,094
Gee, I'm sorry we don't offer
free front-wheel alignment.

555
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,322
It looks like you dented
your license plate. Isn't that a shame?

556
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,899
You'll have time in the slammer
to care of that.

557
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,502
- Make some new ones, huh?
- Hey, Murph, you hear that?

558
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,037
- Yeah.
- Open up the trunk, please.

559
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,610
What are you doing in there?

560
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,116
What, you're impersonating a spare tire?

561
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,085
Would you believe
I dropped my keys in the trunk...

562
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,782
...and the next thing I know...?
- Get out of there!

563
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,086
- Come on, let's go.
- Move it!

564
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,792
- Come on.
- Turn around. Hands up.

565
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,436
- You can't hold me here forever.
- You could have killed me if you wanted.

566
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:26,406
Any step of the way, you could have
revealed my identity, but you didn't.

567
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:30,374
Now, look around. Your work is here.
Your life...

568
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,811
...is here.

569
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,116
Oh, damn you, Barry!

570
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,989
The biofeedback machine's
been repaired.

571
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,121
Now, if we can both reenter the alpha state
at the same time...

572
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,497
...we'll re-create the moment in the dream
when it all went wrong.

573
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,729
You're crazy. It will never work.

574
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,735
Well, it's the only chance we've got.

575
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,969
- Get this thing off me.
- Tina, shut up!

576
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,306
You're gonna sit there and you're
gonna go through this, all right?

577
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,655
Relax!

578
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,006
Tina, I'm not your enemy.

579
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,874
I'm your friend.

580
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,618
Barry, I'm so sorry.

581
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,024
I'm sorry, Barry.

582
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,829
It's okay.

583
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,370
It's okay. It's all right.

584
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,902
It's all right.

585
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,612
I'm just so glad you're back.

586
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,812
Well, here's to my first visit
to Central City.

587
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,014
Hopefully not your last.

588
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,489
Well, how could I stay away?
I was kidnapped...

589
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,357
...saw a bank robbery, met the Flash.

590
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,866
Isn't there something else
might bring you back?

591
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,530
As a matter of fact, there is.

592
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,633
Where is that golden retriever anyway?

593
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,505
Come here.

594
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,471
Oh, that's my cab.
I gotta get to the airport.

595
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,639
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

596
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,786
- You have to get to the airport?
- Yes.

597
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,444
- You have to fly tonight?
- Yes.

598
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,586
- Come on, I'll drive you home.
- You'll drive me to Chicago?

599
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,853
- You bet.
- I don't think so.

600
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,753
Bye.

601
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,249
She's back!

602
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,687
- Just kidding.
- I'm glad you can laugh about it, Lisa.

603
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,020
Actually, I wanted to catch you
and apologize.

604
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,722
Oh, it's okay.
Barry explained everything to me.

605
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,199
- I gotta go. You take care.
- Okay.

606
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,232
Bye, you.

607
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,927
Bye, you.

608
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,303
Did I interrupt something?

609
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,878
Just my life for the last few days.

610
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,347
Barry, do you think
I should turn myself in to the police?

611
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,846
Well, no one was really hurt,
you know.

612
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:01,590
And when you stop and think about it,
you did help me collar the Black Roses.

613
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,920
- I did?
- Well, yeah.

614
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,393
Yeah, I mean,
if I hadn't gone after you...

615
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,362
...I never would have
found them, right?

616
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,699
Yeah, well, how about this?

617
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:18,000
You've been very good about
keeping the secret of mine...

618
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,110
...and I will keep the secret of yours.

619
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,412
But you are gonna have to get rid
of this little souvenir, though.

620
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,608
Don't worry, I can zap it off
with my micro laser in the lab.

621
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,017
That seems a shame.
It's kind of cute, don't you think?

622
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,282
No, I don't.

623
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,159
- But please, do me a favor, Barry.
- Yeah?

624
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:42,128
Next time you have a sleepless night, why
don't you try a nice warm glass of milk.

625
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,865
Right.

626
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,395
