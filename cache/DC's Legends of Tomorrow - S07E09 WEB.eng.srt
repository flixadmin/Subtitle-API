1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,624
Wait. Did everybody make it?

2
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:07,859
No. Bishop's dead.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,828
Well, we have to go back.

4
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:11,363
We can't leave a man behind now.

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,568
We have to go back.

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,699
Gwyn, he sacrificed himself for us.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,588
We cannot go back
or more of us could die.

8
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:20,957
I need a moment.

9
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,610
Uh, are we in John's mansion?

10
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:28,078
Yeah, in the pocket dimension, I think.

11
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,737
Does it still open to the factory?

12
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:38,355
Not unless something terrible
happened to that factory.

13
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:39,590
Oh, the portal must have closed

14
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,157
when the last person exited the manor.

15
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:42,993
So right now there's
no doorway back to Earth.

16
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,962
It's okay. We can still time-jump.

17
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:47,464
No, we can't, not until
we know exactly where and when.

18
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,333
We can't afford to have another mistake.

19
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:50,835
What? What do you mean?

20
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,369
Well, we told her to go home,

21
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,238
and this feels like home to me.

22
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,341
Home is 2022, not here.

23
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:58,342
It was all really chaotic. I-I just...

24
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,276
Hey, Gidget. A-are you okay?

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,779
You look a little...
Oh, she has a fever.

26
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:05,414
Oh, man. Okay, well,
if Gideon is unwell,

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,683
it's definitely not safe to jump,

28
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:08,084
so we are trapped in the mansion.

29
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:09,385
- In hell.
- More like trapped

30
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,555
three inches from hell.

31
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,989
It's gonna be all right, guys.

32
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:13,591
Gideon probably just needs a rest,

33
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,927
and, luckily, we landed
outside the timeline,

34
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,562
which means Evil Gideon can't find us,

35
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,496
and now we have a chance
to come up with our game plan.

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,731
That was the whole...

37
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:23,232
Tactics. We need to think tactics.

38
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:24,701
Give me ten minutes...
I'll have a murder board

39
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:27,489
drawn up and we can do some planning.

40
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,712
It tolls for thee.

41
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,048
Help me, please!

42
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,216
Hello?

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,884
Is someone there?

44
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:45,320
Gwyn!

45
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,488
Hello?

46
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:50,425
Help me! Gwyn!

47
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,313
Alun?

48
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:09,945
Wow, babe, this is your most
complicated murder board yet.

49
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,547
- All right, bottom line is...
- Nice.

50
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,750
Yeah, uh, Evil Gideon's
manufacturing robots

51
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:15,885
to hunt us down.

52
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,121
After all we have done
to protect the timeline...

53
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:23,291
So what we need... ideas, good ideas...

54
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,892
how to defeat robots,

55
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,883
how to travel without
being detected by Evil Gideon.

56
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:31,465
Hey, Gideon.

57
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,635
Didn't see you
at the murder board meeting.

58
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,688
You okay?

59
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,406
I thought I was doing
the right thing coming here,

60
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,609
but they're all so disappointed in me.

61
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,779
It all happened so fast,
I just went with my gut.

62
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,313
What if next time I get confused

63
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,684
and I just jump us all into a tornado?

64
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,285
- I could kill us all.
- No.

65
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:54,055
No, you did good.
You brought us to safety.

66
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,010
Don't be so hard on yourself.

67
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,464
So what did I miss at the meeting?

68
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,099
Oh, you know, they were talking

69
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:08,000
about why Evil Gideon wants
to kill all the Legends.

70
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:09,670
Oh, I'm sure she thinks
they're an unpredictable

71
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:11,658
and destructive force
that needs to be eradicated.

72
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,142
Just a guess.

73
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,844
Looks like someone
restocked the kitchen.

74
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,332
- Have an apple.
- Oh.

75
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,065
Is it getting hot in here,
or is it just me?

76
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,970
Well, if you're referring

77
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:36,563
to the increasing temperature
in the house,

78
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:37,898
- you're correct.
- Oh.

79
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,733
If you're insinuating
we should go upstairs

80
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:42,222
and fool around, also correct.

81
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:53,203
Guys, I'm thinking about
maybe asking Astra out.

82
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:57,650
Our baby boy's all growns up.

83
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:00,251
I just feel, like, clarity, you know?

84
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,921
Like, I haven't smoked weed
or done edibles

85
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:05,024
since we got time-stranded,
and I feel so present.

86
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,826
And now I just can't stop
thinking about her.

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,828
That's great... just be yourself

88
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:10,630
and, you know, don't make it weird.

89
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,532
Be myself. Don't make it weird.

90
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,134
You're Behrad...
you're the cool, chill guy

91
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,669
everyone wants to hang out with.

92
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,038
Be cool and chill.
That's why people like me.

93
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,473
- Exactly.
- All right.

94
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,807
Thanks, guys.

95
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:25,044
- We crushed that.
- Whoo.

96
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:26,412
I love helping little bro.

97
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,880
Oh, 'cause you're time bros?

98
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:30,349
No, 'cause I'm getting
so serious with my Zari.

99
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:34,186
He's like a future
little brother-in-law.

100
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,256
I guess that makes us in-laws
in some weird way.

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,191
Yeah, but you're, like, my best bud,

102
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:42,494
so, like, a time bro-ette.

103
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,515
Thank you, but I hate that.

104
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,500
Is it hot in here?

105
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:51,236
It feels like a million degrees.

106
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,125
Yeah, something is not right.

107
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,362
Gwyn!

108
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:04,884
- Are we in hell?
- Uh...

109
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:07,953
Oh, Lord and all you saints
and martyrs, aid me now.

110
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,489
Okay, calm... calm... calm down, Gwyn.

111
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:12,324
I mean, what's the worst
that can happen?

112
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:13,591
The worst that can happen...

113
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:15,994
we are in the very bowels
of hell, Esperanza.

114
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:18,496
The horrors that await us

115
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,532
are beyond the limits
of our imaginations.

116
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:24,102
Well, yeah, out there,
but, I mean, we...

117
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,356
we would have seen
something come in, right?

118
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,304
You might want
to keep praying, Gwyn.

119
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:40,985
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

120
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,921
You left the door to hell open?

121
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,655
- What were you thinking?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

122
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,127
You see, I thought I heard voices,

123
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,328
and so I opened the door.

124
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:49,698
I'm a grand fool, I know.

125
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,785
There's no telling
what nightmare got in.

126
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:57,371
Oh, where I come from,
the only thing worse than pests

127
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,106
are pests that make themselves at home.

128
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,508
Yeah. Okay, let's split up
and sweep the house.

129
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:03,977
We can't fight Evil Gideon
if we're all possessed.

130
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,578
Or can we?

131
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:07,314
No. No, bad idea.

132
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,049
Sweep the house. Tell everyone.

133
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:10,102
- Go ahead.
- Right.

134
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:20,160
Hey, you ever feel like
someone's watching you?

135
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,961
Well, as a child celebrity,

136
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:24,531
I feel weird when I'm not being watched.

137
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,119
But, yeah, I do know what you mean.

138
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:32,940
Oh, my... Ugh!

139
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:35,175
Disgusting.

140
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,111
Who knows what kind of magic
goo John is hoarding in here?

141
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,636
Disgusting.

142
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,720
There's, um... there's... there's...

143
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,622
there's got to be something
to wear around here.

144
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,458
Mm-hmm. Yeah, somewhere in here.

145
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:53,025
Yeah.

146
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:54,761
I don't like this.

147
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:57,564
You know, we didn't plan
for a hell detour.

148
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,131
Yeah, I know.

149
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:02,268
We got robots and
Evil Gideon and now ghosts?

150
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,322
- I am at capacity.
- Mm.

151
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,997
Something's definitely up there.

152
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,403
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

153
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,619
Behrad!

154
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,720
Don't sneak up on people in hell!

155
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,356
You idiot.

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,377
Sorry.

157
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,846
You look like John.

158
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,867
You look like my Zari.

159
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,645
What's happening?

160
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,097
I think we're being manipulated.

161
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,351
- No.
- Yes.

162
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,644
Why are you attacking us?

163
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,701
Wha... "Us"?

164
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:24,015
Greetings.

165
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,851
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my... Damn.

166
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,987
Why? Why? Why? Why?

167
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:33,143
You idiot!

168
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,296
Hi, everyone.

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,798
This is, uh, mortifying.

170
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:41,166
This had better be consensual, Gary,

171
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,801
- or I'm gonna rip off your...
- It was entirely consensual.

172
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,537
In fact, I was the one
to instigate our first tryst.

173
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:47,739
All right.

174
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,340
Well, how long has this been going on?

175
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:50,942
Uh, well, including
the foreplay, approximately...

176
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,544
No, no. I mean, like...

177
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,098
Like, when did you guys,
like, first hook up?

178
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,649
Uh, the Chernobyl nuclear
meltdown was our first date.

179
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:00,217
- Yeah.
- Oh, lovely.

180
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,286
Sounds very romantic.

181
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,454
I guess that's why Gideon's
been so unfocused.

182
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:06,423
Yeah, and why we ended up here.

183
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,659
Gary said that
the manor feels like home,

184
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,961
so that must be the reason
Gideon bought us here

185
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,063
instead of our actual home...
because of him.

186
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,398
Aw, that's so sweet.

187
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,333
Oh, wait, that's such
a nice thing to do.

188
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,901
This is like a bad reality show.

189
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,936
Thank you very much for that.

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,639
That's it... I know
what's infesting the house.

191
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,208
Well, enlighten us, Miss Logue.

192
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:27,042
It's the Cursed Crew,
and they're watching us,

193
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,679
trying to get a glimpse
of the real world.

194
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,415
- What are you talking about?
- Let me show you.

195
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,603
Lux et veritas.

196
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,787
We are on a reality show from hell.

197
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,067
You're saying there's just
creepers just watching us?

198
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,222
- Yeah, like, everywhere?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,457
They're following us around, filming us.

200
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,359
I don't like the idea
of creepers watching us

201
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,527
for their own amusement.

202
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,163
Not for their amusement,
for their curse.

203
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,931
Back in the '90s,
there was this film crew

204
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,499
that were so desperate for a hit show

205
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,969
they sold their souls to this
demon called Harris Ledes.

206
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,837
The terms of the deal state

207
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,606
that they can't leave his employment

208
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,875
unless they capture something
authentic, something real.

209
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,512
Ah, sounds like a bunch of sad sacks.

210
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,846
No, we need to be careful.

211
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,348
Through Harris's unholy magic,

212
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,050
they can twist emotions
to amplify conflict.

213
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,218
They love drama.

214
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:29,321
Unless we want
to vacate this place forever,

215
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:30,989
I have to confront Harris.

216
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,857
You want to go out there?

217
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,692
I can handle myself.

218
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:36,961
But you all need to handle yourselves.

219
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:38,795
If you feel your emotions
getting amped up,

220
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,030
don't succumb.

221
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:42,299
And just keep your heads
till I get back,

222
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,601
and please don't turn on each other.

223
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,738
Oh, man, this is gonna be
just like "KUWTT".

224
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,207
K-U-W-T-T.

225
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,042
"Keeping Up with the Tarazis",

226
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,178
the reality show about my own family

227
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:55,579
that I was recast on.

228
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,247
Oh, that's right.

229
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:58,848
I forgot what a bummer you were on it.

230
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:00,336
I'm starting to remember, though.

231
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm joking. It's a jo...

232
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:06,123
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

233
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:08,292
- Uh, Miss Spooner?
- Uh-huh?

234
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,480
May I have a word? I just...

235
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,798
Would you mind informing me

236
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:19,569
as to exactly what
this, uh, reality TV is?

237
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,972
Don't worry. Stick with me.

238
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,874
Look, I've watched, like,
40 seasons of "Survivor".

239
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:28,044
Hey, we should form an alliance.

240
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,913
I had an ally once.

241
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,215
And perhaps being stuck in hell

242
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:36,444
is proof that I have strayed
too far from getting his back.

243
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,855
Yep. Uh, never mind.

244
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,556
Forget it. Offer rescinded.

245
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,692
You're too weird for an alliance.

246
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,813
You'd only hold me back.

247
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,133
Reality TV show or not,
we need to find a way

248
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:51,967
to deal with Evil Gideon and her robots.

249
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,736
- Okay, plan, plan.
- Yes.

250
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,239
Let's, uh, free-associate.

251
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:58,141
Hmm, free-associate?

252
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,444
Okay, I guess I'm listening.

253
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:03,279
Robots.

254
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,413
Robots, yes.

255
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,283
Robots don't like water.

256
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:10,453
- No.
- And water is on the ocean.

257
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:13,856
We need to go to
our beach house on the ocean.

258
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,891
- What?
- What?

259
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:17,326
Babe, look, I'm...

260
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,496
I'm drained, okay?
I just... I need a break.

261
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,499
Just, like, a little private island

262
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,634
with a-a yacht for day trips.

263
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:27,102
I mean, is that so much to ask for?

264
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,905
Yes. We don't have time for this.

265
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,373
I don't underst... okay.

266
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,708
Do you not want to do the work?

267
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,242
Of course I want to do the work.

268
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,444
All I do is work. I'm Sara Lance.

269
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:40,015
I'm crazy about work,
but I am also crazy

270
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,887
about personal chefs and
hers-and-hers massages.

271
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,989
Who are you?

272
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:48,824
You know what?

273
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:50,358
I have this all figured out.

274
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:54,296
These super-basic, lazy
reality-show wannabes

275
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,166
are trying to foist the
friends-to-lovers trope on us.

276
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,301
That's why they did the stunt
with the shirt goo.

277
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:04,072
Yeah. Luckily, we are way
too TV savvy to fall for that.

278
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:05,606
Especially me.

279
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,474
It's, like... if we haven't
hooked up already,

280
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,243
why would we hook up now?

281
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,112
We got this.

282
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,499
We're gonna be the friends
that never fight.

283
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:17,218
All we have to do is not
sleep with each other.

284
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,020
You and me, that's crazy.

285
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:21,022
Never in a million years.

286
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:24,726
Yeah, I mean, you know,
because we're just friends,

287
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,428
'cause, obviously, I'm...
I'm genetically identical

288
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,363
to your girlfriend, so I understand

289
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,298
why you would unconsciously
be drawn to me.

290
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,967
To be honest, just the idea of it

291
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:35,668
is, like, kind of, like, blah.

292
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,805
Okay. Okay.

293
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,876
Uh, not to, like, press
the issue, but look at me.

294
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,445
I dress better than her.
I live in your timeline.

295
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,247
In fact, the only real
difference between us

296
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,915
is our personalities.

297
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,851
And, surely, you're not saying that I,

298
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,619
the person who you called
your time bro-ette

299
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:56,056
not 20 minutes ago,
have a bad personality.

300
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,113
Surely not.

301
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,828
Did I say "never in a million years"?

302
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,364
I meant to say "never
in ten million years"!

303
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,066
Mm-hmm? Yeah? Yeah?

304
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,902
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

305
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,936
Miss Lance.

306
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,873
When we first met, we made a deal,

307
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,742
and I have fulfilled
my end of the bargain.

308
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,411
I gave you time travel.

309
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,480
But you have not upheld your side

310
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:24,283
by helping me complete
my sacred mission.

311
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,818
Instead, you have brought me

312
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,853
to the burning inferno of hell itself,

313
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:29,889
and, therefore, with
all due respect, Miss Lance,

314
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:32,758
I must remind you
of your obligations to me.

315
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,027
I do not have time for this.

316
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,862
But you promised me.

317
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,964
Please, we must save Alun.

318
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,766
Yes, Gwyn. Okay?

319
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,601
I have not forgotten about our deal.

320
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,670
I owe you one person to save.

321
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,005
No problem. You got it.
We'll talk about it later.

322
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,408
I'm very sorry, Miss Lance,
but this is not good enough!

323
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:50,742
What do you want, then?

324
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,243
Do you need me to write it down?

325
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,280
Is that gonna make you
happy? Fine. Here.

326
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:59,884
"Gwyn can save one person
from the timeline",

327
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:03,488
signed "Sara Lance".

328
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,891
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to plan.

329
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,026
Thank you. Thank you.

330
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,329
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

331
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,496
Got it.

332
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,686
Plan a holiday.

333
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,054
Oh, my...

334
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,771
Excuse me, young lady,
would you put some clothes on?

335
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,441
No way. It's called strategy.

336
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,077
Being naked is strategy?

337
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,046
You know, it psyches
the other players out.

338
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,481
You know, everyone trusts the naked guy,

339
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,070
because what could they be hiding?

340
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:37,288
But, Gwyn, what I'm
hiding is all in here.

341
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:41,511
Very, very, very, very...

342
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,282
Lowest Common Demoninator Productions,

343
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:06,949
how may I hel...

344
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:10,086
Astra Logue? Uh, is that really you?

345
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,989
Unlucky for you, I'm back.

346
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:17,218
And you're gonna do exactly as I say.

347
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,772
Astra Logue.

348
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,408
It's been too long.

349
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,742
Ooh, you look awful.

350
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,544
It's not your fault, though.

351
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,413
Being outside of hell's
bad for your pores,

352
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,214
- bad for your karma.
- Harris.

353
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:41,717
- Still negging like it's 2007?
- Oh, it's called trolling now.

354
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,352
And these souls that I'm trolling

355
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,640
are gonna be ripping
each other apart by midseason.

356
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,392
Those are my souls you're messing with.

357
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,012
So hands off.

358
00:16:52,118 --> 00:16:54,564
Astra, hey, I-I didn't know
you were still in the biz.

359
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,900
Hey, look, I would never want
to step on your toes,

360
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,620
scuff those gorgeous heels.

361
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:03,572
Look, tell you what...

362
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:04,874
souls are yours.

363
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,143
I'll put the crew back
to "Kitchen Night Terrors".

364
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,297
Good. Then we don't have a problem.

365
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,621
Sir, we found this soul
lurking around outside,

366
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:21,108
following her.

367
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,483
I made this weird, didn't I?

368
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,999
So what was the plan with this one, huh?

369
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:35,169
Classic flaying? Exsanguination?

370
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:38,958
Oh, puddling? Huh?

371
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:43,399
Puddling is when we...
we remove all your bones.

372
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,967
You just turn into a human
puddle, and we splash in you.

373
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,503
Not that.

374
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,205
So what do you say?

375
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:53,461
Take this one together,
for old times, huh?

376
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:08,256
Ah, no.

377
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,524
Astra.

378
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,759
You... ah, you've become one of them!

379
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,027
Disgusting!

380
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,597
Next thing you know,
she's gonna be talking

381
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:17,799
about found family
and having a-a conscience.

382
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,036
So what if she does have a conscience?

383
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,770
That's part of what makes her amazing.

384
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:24,340
- She's come so far.
- Behrad, shut up.

385
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,375
What?

386
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,275
Behrad, was it?

387
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,746
See, the thing that
you think makes her amazing

388
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,849
- actually now makes her...
- Vulnerable.

389
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,874
Down here, she's any demon's plaything.

390
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:41,989
Oh, hoo, she's really mad at you.

391
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,358
I'm not detecting much pushback.

392
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,760
Fight it, Astra.

393
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,095
But if you can't, I totally get it.

394
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,798
Oh, yuck.

395
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,833
So chill. You're a nice guy? Yeah.

396
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,268
Here's the thing about nice guys...

397
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,871
they are all over the place
down here in hell.

398
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,407
The nicer they are, the more
secrets they got buried.

399
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,062
So I wonder...

400
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:08,101
What have you really got
all locked up in here?

401
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:13,587
Or maybe, is it... nothing?

402
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,823
You got... Oh, it's so boring!

403
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,659
Boring. I'm bored.

404
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:19,893
Why did you follow me?

405
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,495
- I had this handled.
- Yeah. No, duh.

406
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,430
I saw what you did
to that guy at the front desk.

407
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,266
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't triggered

408
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,968
- by being back.
- What's that supposed to mean?

409
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:29,404
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

410
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:31,172
Save it for the cameras.

411
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:33,093
Please, no!

412
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:37,944
No, no, no. I can't be here.

413
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,380
So you either think that
I'm too weak to go solo

414
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:43,016
or I'm just gonna backslide
into being a monster.

415
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,119
- I thought we were friends.
- We are!

416
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,921
But... I don't want to talk
in front of the cameras.

417
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,590
Well, there's not really another option.

418
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,947
They're still here
because you followed me.

419
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,631
Well, I enjoyed every bit of that.

420
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,653
And not just the chocolate.
The sex was great, too.

421
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,494
What's wrong?

422
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,157
What are we doing?

423
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,658
Maybe they're right.

424
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:13,349
Maybe this thing between us
is clouding my judgment.

425
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,431
Or maybe it's all been
heightened by this hell house.

426
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,667
The last thing the Legends need
is for their time pilot

427
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,468
to be obsessed
with your sweet, little bottom.

428
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:24,972
No, no. Hell house or not,
our judgment isn't clouded.

429
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:27,974
You... you do genuinely admire
my sweet, little bottom,

430
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,962
and I do genuinely love you.

431
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:33,366
I have to go.

432
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,049
Uh, no, that... that that was
the reality show effect.

433
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,285
I-I know it's too soon
to talk about love.

434
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,755
You know, t-that's weeks
away, e-even a month.

435
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,577
I'm sorry. I just need
some time to think.

436
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,024
You are in over your head this time.

437
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:01,427
How so?

438
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,545
Hello?

439
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:07,047
How are you in over your head?

440
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,815
Who's talking?

441
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,116
Oh, you, hopefully.

442
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,385
I don't want to share my emotions

443
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:12,887
with a disembodied voice.

444
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,945
Don't you, just a little?

445
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,367
Well, I guess it would
be nice to unload.

446
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:23,469
This is just between you and me?

447
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,956
Of course.

448
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:32,438
This has all been quite overwhelming.

449
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,140
My human side...

450
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:37,276
well, it's been developing
all sorts of new feelings,

451
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,245
and I particularly hate
this one called self-doubt.

452
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,381
Your human side?

453
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:42,848
Yes.

454
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:45,084
Sometimes I wish I could
turn off my emotions

455
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,620
and just approach things
more analytically,

456
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,622
like my CPU was designed.

457
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,791
That would be quite dangerous.

458
00:21:51,815 --> 00:21:55,093
Well, some people would say
in these peculiar circumstances

459
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:59,322
that unchecked emotions
could be much more dangerous.

460
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:02,052
Maybe you're right.

461
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,244
Gideon?

462
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,480
I'm dumping you, Gary.

463
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,916
- It's over.
- What?

464
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,884
I need to devote
my full energy to my work.

465
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:21,119
But... but... but my bottom.

466
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:24,542
Please don't make a scene.
You'll only embarrass yourself.

467
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,528
You're not thinking
about what Nate said, are you?

468
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:43,229
Ten million years.

469
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:45,966
I'm just not as
laid-back as the other Zari.

470
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,935
I simply take advantage of my genes

471
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,637
to utilize a little variety
in my appearance.

472
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,540
Tell me this... is it a crime
to admit that I am,

473
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:55,762
empirically speaking, very hot?

474
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:58,299
Perhaps the mere sight of you makes him,

475
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:00,401
I don't know, nervous for some reason.

476
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,870
You know what? You're right.
He's nervous.

477
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,338
But why? We're just friends.

478
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:05,807
There's no reason for him
to be nervous around me.

479
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,309
Maybe it's another Zari.

480
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,844
Why would he be nervous around her?

481
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,645
They're in love. They're moving in.

482
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:13,148
That's a big step. It's...

483
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:16,952
Oh, my God.

484
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,353
- That's it.
- What?

485
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,241
He doesn't want her
to move into the totem.

486
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:23,626
How could he do this to her?

487
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,093
- Gidget.
- Hmm?

488
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,548
We have to protect that little nerd.

489
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,114
You're on my team, right?

490
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,148
Of course I am.

491
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:31,750
- Of course. Oh, my God.
- Of course.

492
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:33,637
I love you.

493
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:44,768
Yeah! Yep! Yep!

494
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,400
Hey, I saw you talking to Zari.

495
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,735
What'd she say?

496
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,289
I shouldn't. It was in confidence.

497
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,875
I'll just say it's interesting
that she thinks

498
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,429
she utilizes her genes
better than your Zari.

499
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:01,235
What?

500
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,550
She thinks my Zari's ugly?

501
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:05,984
She thinks she's better than her?

502
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,252
I cannot say.

503
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:08,921
- Hey, good talk.
- Hmm.

504
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,945
Spot buddies for life.

505
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:14,311
- Nice.
- Ouch.

506
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:22,201
Deep into planning... refreshing.

507
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:24,036
The rest of the Legends are concerned

508
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,257
with more trivial matters.

509
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,029
I was thinking, though,
with this current plan...

510
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:35,114
How are you going to prevent
any harm to Alun

511
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,782
throughout the rest of the war?

512
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:40,405
I mean, there is, after all,
four more years of it?

513
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,292
It's too bad you cannot save them all...

514
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:49,795
those poor men.

515
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:52,482
Perhaps we can save all of them.

516
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:59,370
- Why go back out there?
- Oh, you're talking to me now?

517
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:02,306
I'm just wondering why
you want to go back out there

518
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,332
being that it's the
source of your trauma.

519
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,269
My trauma?

520
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:13,151
Behrad, I grew up in hell.

521
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:17,020
It sucked, but I survived
by pushing through, not hiding.

522
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:18,489
What the hell are you hiding from?

523
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:19,923
Me?

524
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:22,359
I'm B. I'm chill.

525
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:24,595
I don't have trauma.
That's my whole thing.

526
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,230
Frankly, I think you're projecting,

527
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:28,298
which I hear is quite common.

528
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:31,769
Oh, please! Grow up!

529
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,894
Frange!

530
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:39,976
Men are cowards.

531
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,013
Yep! Yep!

532
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:44,481
Nate...

533
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,950
I think there's
something wrong with Gideon.

534
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:50,320
My boy Gary...
he's brokenhearted right now.

535
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:54,849
But Nate-y H still has
to drop these truth bombs.

536
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,035
Look, just when you think
you can trust a woman,

537
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,338
she turns around
and shows her true self.

538
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,574
That's why you can't trust dames.

539
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,876
You can only trust...

540
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,778
gains.

541
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,315
Oh, no.

542
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,916
Nate...

543
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,505
he sucks to be around right now.

544
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,269
I need to find someone more levelheaded.

545
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,854
What do you mean Gideon is different?

546
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:28,209
She just came to me about an alliance.

547
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:36,017
Want to start a secret
double alliance, hmm?

548
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:42,739
Gary's head
just isn't in the game.

549
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:45,174
If he can't get it together,
then he's out.

550
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:47,644
Of what? I'm not sure yet.

551
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:51,336
But I know I'm ahead.

552
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:55,250
Co-Cap, once you're finished coming up

553
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:56,618
with a brilliant plan, we need to talk

554
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:59,588
about how Bro Nate is going to
ruin Flannel Zari's life.

555
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:02,057
I have come up with the perfect plan

556
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,392
to defeat Evil Gideon.

557
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:07,028
Pack your sunscreen and
your hangover remedies,

558
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:10,384
because the legends are going to Cabo!

559
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,469
That's her plan?

560
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:15,737
Of course a trip would be nice,

561
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,639
but we have business to take care of.

562
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:18,675
We have messes to clean up.

563
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:19,742
We can't just go to the beach

564
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:21,864
every time life gets hard.

565
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:23,798
Oh, no.

566
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,834
I'm turning into the implanted
memories of my mother.

567
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:32,287
Wash your hands! It's time for dinner!

568
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,056
These Legends are going
to have to listen to me now.

569
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,390
If I had it my way,

570
00:27:36,414 --> 00:27:40,261
the only Z we would
have at dinner is ziti. Oh!

571
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,164
I mean, honestly, and
this is a true question,

572
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:46,667
did that self-tanner
seep into his brain?

573
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:50,405
And that is how you make a rabbit trap.

574
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,297
Table's set, and the knives are out.

575
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,251
I hope everyone's hungry,
because they're about to get

576
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,795
a mouthful of the meal
I just cooked and my opinions.

577
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,267
Oh, crap.

578
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,401
So I get down to dinner,

579
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:15,604
and the Legends have done
literally nothing I told them.

580
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,126
The place is a powder keg.

581
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,830
Without human emotions
clouding my judgment,

582
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:23,822
I'll make sure the Legends
get exactly what they deserve.

583
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,603
I don't think Behrad will be joining us.

584
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:27,804
He is hiding in bed.

585
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:30,507
Oh, just like he spent
most of his teenage years.

586
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:32,976
No. Not like that.

587
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,478
He just didn't want to be on camera.

588
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:35,912
So we had to recast him.

589
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:38,214
- You recast your own brother?
- Mm-hmm.

590
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,183
Let us pray.

591
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:42,786
Our who art in,

592
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,821
hallowed be thy.

593
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:47,089
Thy come, thy be done...

594
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:49,492
Beautiful words.

595
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:52,461
Uh, Aves, I just want to say thank you

596
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,330
- for this beautiful meal.
- You're welcome.

597
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:56,899
Fake.

598
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:58,901
- Excuse me?
- You know, I think that this

599
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:02,170
is now a wonderful opportunity
to bring up the plan

600
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:05,674
with regards to what
Miss Lance promised me.

601
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:07,042
What is he talking about?

602
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,712
She promised me
that I could save one life,

603
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:11,146
and that life...

604
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,968
is Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

605
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:19,254
By preventing the assassination
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

606
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,010
we shall prevent the entire Great War.

607
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:27,396
How dare you misrepresent me?

608
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,464
You led me to believe

609
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:33,101
that you wanted to save
one inconsequential person

610
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,903
from the timeline,
not your entire generation.

611
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,973
No, thank you. Babe, listen to me.

612
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:41,276
You know I would never promise
something like that,

613
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,744
and he is clearly a liar.

614
00:29:42,768 --> 00:29:44,980
- I am not a liar.
- I am not talking to you.

615
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:46,515
That's it!

616
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:49,652
I am done cleaning up
after you, after all of you!

617
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:52,487
I am not the den mother.

618
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,989
And would you put some clothes on?

619
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,223
Oh, my...

620
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:58,058
Look what you did. Ava, wait!

621
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:00,461
- But a promise is a promise.
- Perfect.

622
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:02,296
Oh, let's really turn the heat up.

623
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,399
I want to see them rip
each other's limbs off.

624
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:07,401
- So, Spooner...
- Mm?

625
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:09,136
Whose faction did you decide to join...

626
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,138
- Nate or Zari's?
- Mm.

627
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:12,807
Oh, my gosh.

628
00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:15,877
You're trying to team up against me?

629
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,679
Well, good luck getting
anyone on your side.

630
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:20,614
Oh, my God, you're such a backstabber.

631
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,050
Nobody wants to be on your side.

632
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,217
- Everyone's on my side.
- No.

633
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,487
All you ever do is talk
crap about my Zari.

634
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:26,921
And that woman's a saint!

635
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,422
They both make good points,

636
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:31,391
but just know that
whichever alliance I join,

637
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,595
I promise I will betray it.

638
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:35,602
You know what?

639
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,997
Since we're already in hell,

640
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,254
there's only one way to settle this.

641
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:44,037
This is the weirdest vibe yet.

642
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:45,172
What... what's going on?

643
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:46,974
Well, Nate doesn't want
to move into the totem.

644
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:48,075
She called you ugly. That's not true.

645
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,942
I totally want to live
in the totem with you.

646
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:51,979
And also, I believe she's
trying to sleep with me.

647
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:54,448
- Oh, my God.
- Upstairs she said that to me.

648
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:56,316
Hey. Are we in hell right now?

649
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,852
Uh, yeah, and we're
all under the effects

650
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,654
of a demon's reality show.

651
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:04,257
Huh. Okay. That, uh... that makes sense.

652
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,825
It does?

653
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:09,884
Yeah, because I have the
uncontrollable urge to do this.

654
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:15,435
How could I?

655
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,504
Babe, I'm really sorry. Okay?

656
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:19,171
I just really needed a break

657
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:21,441
and have a reset and
swim with dolphins, babe.

658
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,676
Would you stop with the vacation?

659
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,312
This is divine punishment!

660
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:27,780
Enough!

661
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,349
This is exactly what he wants!

662
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:32,652
You're all complete idiots!
We're getting out of here!

663
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:35,287
Gideon, I need your brain!
Put on the colander!

664
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,057
We will figure out an exorcism topside!

665
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,092
Excellent. You should all simply pile

666
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,827
into Gwyn's ramshackle time contraption,

667
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:43,229
and I'll take you out of here.

668
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:44,664
It'll be a breeze.

669
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:47,033
A breeze? No!

670
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:49,153
She'll kill us all!

671
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:57,943
I've been trying to tell you
s-she's not herself.

672
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,646
She'll time jump us into a tornado.

673
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,015
Gary, don't do anything crazy.

674
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,244
I'm trying to save your life,
so help me.

675
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,108
- I'll eat this.
- Eat?

676
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:15,126
- No!
- Get back here!

677
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,381
Gary! Gary!

678
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,993
Get him.

679
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:39,884
Wow, sounds really tense
down there, huh?

680
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,621
Back off. Those are my friends.

681
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:45,490
Yeah, of course.
Your friends who love you.

682
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:48,158
You know, they sure could use
a chill and cool Behrad

683
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,995
right about now to calm things down.

684
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:54,765
So I'm just gonna be that guy forever?

685
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,975
Well, the real question is,
who are you without this?

686
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,496
And who would want to
hang out with this mess?

687
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:11,701
Let's slice him open.

688
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,359
- Get him!
- Go, go, go, go!

689
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:24,579
Go, go!

690
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:35,104
You guys want to make asses
of yourselves for the cameras?

691
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:36,424
Is that what you want?

692
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,711
Because I know what it gets you.

693
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:46,147
I have countless memories
of cameras in my face,

694
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:49,484
every time I was scared,
every time I cried.

695
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:52,054
You want to know about
the first time I ever failed?

696
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,155
Don't worry.

697
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,712
"Keeping Up With The Tarazis"
had a whole episode about it!

698
00:33:57,717 --> 00:34:00,195
I figured out the way to beat it

699
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:02,663
was to be unflappable, chill.

700
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:05,267
Pop a gummy, lay low, relax.

701
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,502
If they don't see it get to you,

702
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:10,005
they don't have the power.

703
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:11,907
But...

704
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,009
it gets to me.

705
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:16,044
A lot of things do.

706
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:18,713
I'm sad sometimes.

707
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,449
I'm scared a lot.

708
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:25,272
I died, and I never talked about it...

709
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:31,432
Because maybe I'm afraid
if I'm honest with anyone,

710
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:33,113
they'll end up hating me.

711
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,225
All I wanted to do was ask you out,

712
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,437
and now I'm crying
for all of hell to see

713
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,639
and laugh at me...

714
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:48,328
for my friends to realize
they never knew the real me...

715
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:56,141
And for the girl I like
to run far away from me.

716
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:59,608
But I'm done now.

717
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,991
Here's the honest truth.

718
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,727
When it comes to you, Astra...

719
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,447
I lose all my cool.

720
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:11,921
I'm just B.

721
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,106
It's gone. Ah, my shows!

722
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,042
What happened?

723
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,782
He got real.

724
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,611
Is it over?

725
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:46,911
The curse is lifted.

726
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:48,880
Your contract with Harris is terminated.

727
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,300
Get the hell out of here.

728
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:01,915
Gideon?

729
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,116
Are you in there?

730
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:14,491
Gary, I'm so sorry.

731
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:30,710
- Here, babe, let me do this.
- No. It's all right.

732
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,114
It's not, and I know it's not.

733
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:39,797
Look, even when my brain
was on a vacation episode

734
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:41,265
of "The Real Housewives",

735
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,320
I knew you were right.

736
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:47,657
Go on.

737
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:52,042
I let you take on
too much responsibility

738
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:53,911
for the mission, and it's not fair.

739
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:57,215
You are not the house mom,
you are the co-captain...

740
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,285
and a very beautiful, sexy...

741
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:02,771
co-captain.

742
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:07,222
So when were you going to
tell me about this promise

743
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,926
- that you made to Gwyn, hmm?
- Pardon the intrusion, ladies.

744
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,462
But, uh, if you are attending
the, uh, mea culpas,

745
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:17,691
then I have to admit that
I got a little carried away.

746
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,237
I'm not very well acquainted
with the rules

747
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:21,971
of time travel yet,

748
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:25,575
but even I know that
one cannot simply stop

749
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,344
the Great War.

750
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:28,945
I'm sorry, Gwyn.

751
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:31,414
But I will uphold my promise, all right?

752
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,750
We're gonna find a way
to save your guy...

753
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:37,854
as cleanly as possible.

754
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:40,675
No timeline explosions.

755
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:44,093
I guess it is sweet

756
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:45,862
you were both looking out for me.

757
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,296
Girl, of course.

758
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,399
Look, I love you.
I love you. I love you.

759
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:52,668
I love you, and I cannot
wait to live with you.

760
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:55,804
I know. Besides, you know
how many aunties

761
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:57,559
are very psyched for your arrival?

762
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:01,966
Which reminds me, I, uh...
I got to get back.

763
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:07,550
You are going to stay and
apologize to each other.

764
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:10,919
Yeah? By the way, sorry about
the whole wine thing.

765
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:13,011
Okay, bye.

766
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,391
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:17,859
- It's okay.
- Is it...

768
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,889
- Honestly, the voice was a lot...
- My voice?

769
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,918
You can't be serious
right now with what...

770
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:26,020
All is forgiven.

771
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,443
How did you know that would
work with the camera guys?

772
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:39,281
Uh, didn't, just wanted
to say how I felt.

773
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:43,118
Right. Yeah, the reality show
made everyone say crazy things.

774
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:44,786
Not me.

775
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,321
That was genuine...

776
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:50,024
a genuine full-blown freak-out
in front of the hot girl

777
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:51,845
I've had a crush on forever.

778
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,699
Well, who knows?

779
00:38:57,723 --> 00:39:00,887
Maybe that girl has a
little crush on you, too.

780
00:39:07,466 --> 00:39:11,412
I'm sorry. I'm just in my own head.

781
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,981
Is, uh, something wrong?

782
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:18,319
- Don't you want to?
- Oh, I want to, really bad.

783
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,254
But I might need a minute

784
00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:23,490
to figure out what being
unchill and sober is like

785
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,711
before I'm the best boyfriend
you ever had.

786
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:30,649
If you want to go slow, that's cool.

787
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,455
You know you guys are so dorky?

788
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:39,974
Spooner, the cameras are gone.

789
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:42,076
Oh. You know, I got so comfortable,

790
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,878
I didn't even realize it.

791
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:45,212
House meeting!

792
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:48,349
Just... Clothes, Spooner, clothes.

793
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:51,418
House meeting, everyone!

794
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:54,188
Sure, why not?

795
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:56,257
Gary, the reality show's over.

796
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:58,058
Yes, and I, for one, am very pleased.

797
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:00,743
- You call that entertainment?
- No, I don't.

798
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,144
No, we're having this house meeting

799
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:05,381
because there are apologies
that need to happen.

800
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,716
Gary, it's okay.

801
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,250
Gwyn and Sarah and I talked it out.

802
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,819
Yeah, and Nate and I are besties again.

803
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:13,355
No, apologies to me
and Gideon, you jerks.

804
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,590
She wouldn't have had to
switch over to robo mode

805
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,426
if you guys didn't make
her second-guess herself

806
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,762
and then make her feel guilty
about our relationship!

807
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:21,549
Thank you, Gary.

808
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,602
I've noticed that you've all found love

809
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,503
in some of the most chaotic of times,

810
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,240
and you've still done your
jobs with terrific aplomb.

811
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,209
So, you know, the fact that you think

812
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:35,443
that Gary and I cannot find comfort

813
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,646
in each other's sweet embrace,

814
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,166
it's a bit hypocritical.

815
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:47,656
Yeah, actually, you're...
you're completely right.

816
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,592
And we're sorry.

817
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:53,161
- Yeah. We're sorry.
- Sorry.

818
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,163
- Yeah.
- We're sorry.

819
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,298
It's quite nice feeling emotional again.

820
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,967
It's like a warm and gooey feeling

821
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:02,225
as opposed to a cold and
calculated urge to murder.

822
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:05,073
Say what?

823
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:07,795
I'm just kidding.
I'm quite funny, actually.

824
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,614
So funny.

825
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,915
But, hey, since you are
a part of this team

826
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,151
and a supercomputer, so you tell us,

827
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,653
where do you think we should go?

828
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,421
I'm glad you asked, Captain,
because I've given it

829
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,623
much tactical and
emotional consideration,

830
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,460
and I think I want to trust
my gut, as us humans say,

831
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,395
and my gut is telling me
to plot a course

832
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,064
for Sarajevo in 1914.

833
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,334
We need to save Archduke Franz Ferdinand

834
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,121
and stop World War I.

835
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,532
What?
