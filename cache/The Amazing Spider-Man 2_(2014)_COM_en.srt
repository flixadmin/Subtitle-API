1
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,185
Hi. My name is Alex Kurtzman.

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,105
I'm one of the writers
of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,690
My name is Jeff Pinkner.

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,860
I am also one of the writers
of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

5
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,195
I am Matt Tolmach.

6
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,989
I am one of the producers
of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,909
I'm Avi Arad.
I'm a producer on the movie.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,595
Alex, you're also
an executive producer.

9
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,621
I am, Matt. Thank you for noting that.

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,832
- Yeah. You forgot.
- I appreciate that.

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,293
That's my favorite logo.
You see, this is cool.

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,945
- It is a cool logo.
- We made it...

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,798
many, many years ago when...

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,468
I remember I took shit for actually
spending some money to do it...

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,721
and at the time it was 80 grand.

16
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,348
- Can you imagine?
- What was the first logo you did it on?

17
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,768
It was done for X-Men.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,146
- X-Men. That's what I thought. Yeah.
- That's it.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,522
- The first one.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,067
And what was interesting
that all those people...

21
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,403
- ...were clapping to the logo.
- Right.

22
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,490
- That's what we call branding.
- Louder than to the logo of X-Men.

23
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,161
After they saw the movie, of course,
it changed.

24
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,552
- Look. It's Richard Parker.
- That's amazing.

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,422
So this is one of the things...

26
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:34,052
that we were sort of wrestling with
coming into this movie...

27
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,930
Alex and Jeff, you guys wanted
to crack in the script right away...

28
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,349
was the sort of ongoing question
of what happened...

29
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,934
with Peter Parker's parents.

30
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,706
Yeah. I think... In the first movie...

31
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,564
I think it was the thing
that intrigued us the most...

32
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,150
was that it was the part
of Peter Parker's story...

33
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,610
that hadn't been told yet.

34
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,461
Questions were raised
but never answered.

35
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,324
So when we saw the first movie,
I think our first instinct...

36
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,415
was we needed the answer
to those questions.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,162
And we kind of loved
the Rashomon idea...

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,832
of the same moment retold now
through the father's point of view...

39
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,644
after having seen the opening
of the first Spider-Man movie...

40
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,047
- ...through the son's point of view.
- I remember reading that first draft...

41
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,257
with that feeling like,
"I've seen this...

42
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,093
but from a different point of view."

43
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,512
- Yeah.
- Now I'm gonna see what happened...

44
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,347
from the parents' point of view.

45
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,577
And, of course, one of the things
that has always been present...

46
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,855
in the comic books,
but comic book fans feel very...

47
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:30,691
Are very split about, is whether or not...

48
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,362
the story of Peter's parents is valid...

49
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,697
- ...to the canon.
- Right.

50
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,699
- Right.
- This is more or less...

51
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,244
recapturing what you saw
in movie one...

52
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,998
and then going into
some of the issues...

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,530
that we never got to explain.

54
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,627
We start right here.

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,421
This is the jet I wish I had...

56
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,923
but I don't.

57
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,718
- We... I wish you had it too.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,471
It would have made traveling
to New York to shoot a lot easier.

59
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,056
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

60
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,187
What was the controversy
over his parents, Jeff?

61
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,593
- What were you referring to?
- I think a lot of peop...

62
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,605
You know, in the comic book...

63
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,816
his parents are gone...

64
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,862
and it's very much
the death of Uncle Ben...

65
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,658
that creates him as Spider-Man
and sort of sets him on his journey.

66
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,954
- But as would any real human being...
- Well, actually the parents' story was...

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,083
Comics in the old days...
Not now, unfortunately...

68
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,962
- ...so they're not as good.
- Were kind of a reflection of the times.

69
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,548
- Right.
- So the story of the parents...

70
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,301
was absolutely a by-product
of the Rosenberg trial.

71
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,552
Right. Exactly.

72
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,806
And then it was...

73
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,642
Unfortunately, the Rosenbergs
didn't have a good ending...

74
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,937
so they kept it like that.

75
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:54,025
But, of course, they build
the Spider-Man universe into it.

76
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,361
And this man is a great actor.

77
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,697
- I mean, both of them.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,951
Avi, when did your personal fascination
with comic books start?

79
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,578
- In the '20s.
- At 16.

80
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,833
But we didn't have comics
until I was 16.

81
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,545
But I had total fascination
of mythology...

82
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,255
and history of the world.

83
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,715
The Old World.

84
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,386
My contemporaries,
like the Inquisition...

85
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,597
and, you know, stuff like that.

86
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,518
And back then, they really gave voice
to kids in a way that other media didn't.

87
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,520
Not if you thought you could escape.

88
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,372
Richard!

89
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,649
Mary!

90
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,827
This set was kind of amazing
because you guys built it on...

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
- It was...
- A fuse...

92
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,250
It was a fuselage that we built on a...
Like a gimbal.

93
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,001
- Yeah.
- It shook.

94
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,586
We called it the rotisserie.

95
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,630
And it rotated and...

96
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,551
It's a lot of the same stuff
that Kubrick did in...

97
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,096
- ...2001. But now...
- Yeah.

98
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,474
- In 2014. Yeah.
- In 2014.

99
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,605
- Which we were gonna call this.
- That's right.

100
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,021
- Personally, I adore this actress.
- Yes.

101
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,773
We all do.

102
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,066
Roosevelt.

103
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,637
- So it was really hard...
- Personally and professionally.

104
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,404
She's amazing. Embeth.

105
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,995
We loved the idea too of setting up
something that the mystery...

106
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,205
at the beginning of the movie...

107
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,666
that Peter would inherit later
in the second half...

108
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,717
and he would find it
right at the moment...

109
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,547
when he needed some guidance
the most, when he was the most lost.

110
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,424
Yeah.

111
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,355
And also part of what excited us
about doing a sequence like this...

112
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,221
in the opening of this movie
is that Spider-Man had never...

113
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,017
It... It's always been so contained
to New York...

114
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,228
and it's always been
these wonderful sequences...

115
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,356
that take place in New York.
We were really attracted to the idea...

116
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,485
of opening up the universe right away
to sort of a bigger sequence.

117
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,571
Particularly one that
didn't involve Peter...

118
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,698
which was kind of a rarity, I think...

119
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,509
- ...making a Spider-Man movie.
- Right.

120
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,162
This scene got a lot of publicity
in the Daily Bugle...

121
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,705
and other New York papers.

122
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,083
That was like a big deal...

123
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,835
that these people disappeared...

124
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,326
- ...in the plane crash.
- Yeah.

125
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,090
And there's a quality to this action,
which is more...

126
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,761
It feels more like
a classic action movie...

127
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,097
and not necessarily like a, you know,
in quotations, "comic book movie."

128
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,932
Yeah. This is... I totally agree, Jeff.

129
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,226
This is...
You know, our DP Dan Mindel...

130
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,564
did such a beautiful job
of photographing this movie.

131
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,335
And this felt like a real departure...

132
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,902
from what we'd done before
in Spider-Man movies.

133
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,781
I think that was...
I think a big part of our collective goal...

134
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,034
was figuring out
how to open the world up...

135
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,036
and make the world bigger.

136
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,538
Without losing the intimacy
of Spider-Man.

137
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,582
But also expanding the universe
around him.

138
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,251
That's right. And one of the first things
we talked about...

139
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,420
when we sat down
to make this movie...

140
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,672
to write this movie, was it's...

141
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,009
Peter's growing up. We wanted
to make a more mature story.

142
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,179
We wanted to tell a story
about how you go from teenager...

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
to young adult.

144
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,266
That's exactly right.

145
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,768
And the idea that...

146
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,729
And this moment,
now you understand...

147
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,380
how Spider-Man
became Spider-Man.

148
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,687
- And as we saw the...
- And this may be my single...

149
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,360
- ...favorite shot of the film.
- Yeah.

150
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,405
This is probably the best example
in this movie...

151
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,117
of tremendous move forward
with the technology.

152
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,493
Yeah. Yep.

153
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,079
- This is...
- The way the suit ripples...

154
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,930
- ...sells the reality of it.
- Jerome...

155
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,792
It's a redesign of the suit...
...and his team.

156
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,920
- ...from the last movie.
- Which was by popular demand.

157
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,672
- Yep.
- The fans had said...

158
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,259
they didn't love the last one, and...

159
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,012
- And we want them to love everything.
- We're here to please.

160
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,722
And this is perfect.

161
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,184
But more important, this CGI...

162
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,770
never looked so real.

163
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,650
So kudo to Sony Animation...

164
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,235
and Jerome Chen.

165
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,030
- Just awesome.
- This is Paul Giamatti...

166
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,076
who had gone on late-night television
a bunch of years ago...

167
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,121
and announced that it was his dream
to play the Rhino...

168
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,624
in a Spider-Man movie, so...

169
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,710
- We aim to please.
- We... Yeah.

170
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,253
Once again, we aim to please.

171
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,717
And here he is as Aleksei Sytsevich,
the precursor to the Rhino.

172
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,180
Spider-Man!

173
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,973
Hello, pedestrians.

174
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,239
Just a cool way to open the movie too
because there really hadn't been...

175
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,011
a car chase of this scope either...

176
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,243
- Yeah. Correct.
...in a Spider-Man movie.

177
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,954
Interesting, so it...

178
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,082
There's a law in New York
that prohibits you...

179
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,710
from driving a car
faster than 30 miles an hour...

180
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,378
when you're filming a car chase.

181
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,048
So some of this sequence,
we actually...

182
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,217
The bigger action stuff...

183
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,469
and the driving had to be filmed
in Rochester.

184
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,138
Which we had to double
for downtown Manhattan.

185
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,433
The fun of this too was figuring out...

186
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,728
You know, whenever you're
designing an action sequence...

187
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,539
you wanna figure out how
you're putting these story threads...

188
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,414
setting up these
big emotional ideas...

189
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,652
and the fun of building
the sequence together...

190
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:34,114
was watching all of these
different moments kind of collide...

191
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,367
you know, literally and figuratively.

192
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,620
And I think that part
of what got us...

193
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,706
the most excited was the idea of,
in the middle of all this...

194
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,625
Peter getting the phone call...

195
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,045
that he was missing graduation.
It felt definitively Spider-Man...

196
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,298
you know, to be in the middle of
this moment, but then be called back...

197
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,676
to this incredibly intimate,
very normal...

198
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,807
- That's his life in a nutshell.
- That's right.

199
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,771
I thought it was great
what you guys did here.

200
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,057
The idea that...
In the middle of this chase...

201
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,520
he stops to save somebody's life.
This is really the beginning of the plot...

202
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,231
with Max Dillon,
the great Jamie Foxx.

203
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,902
But in the middle of all this,
he stops to extend a hand to a citizen.

204
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,073
- Yeah.
- And that's the beginning of this story.

205
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,281
That he saves a guy...

206
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,117
who ends up sort of worshipping him,
as a result.

207
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,079
And then things go terribly wrong later.

208
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,291
But it's sort of... It's all happening
in this first chase sequence.

209
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,169
It's fun to look for the small moments...

210
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,589
that are the Spider-Man moments.

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,049
- Yeah.
- Like stopping to help...

212
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,509
a normal guy on the road.

213
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,095
- That's right.
- It's... Those are the moments...

214
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,266
that you try and build
the whole scene around.

215
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,391
The shoot-them-up stuff
is the easy part.

216
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,770
It's the small, intimate moments
that connect you to the bigger ideas...

217
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,147
and the characters are...

218
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,150
And the other thing we tried to do
with this sequence is...

219
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,236
what makes it uniquely Spider-Man,
is his sense of humor.

220
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,032
Yeah. And the idea that he's actually
this awkward teen...

221
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,868
but when he puts on the suit,
he can be...

222
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,289
somebody else and uses his sense
of humor to disarm the bad guys.

223
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,707
Yeah.

224
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,960
Very traditionally
Spider-Man in that way.

225
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,879
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

226
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,882
And there's a quality of joy
to everything he does...

227
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,510
unlike some more brooding
superheroes or you're put upon...

228
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,097
Also get the feeling he's come
a long way since the last movie.

229
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,266
He's really good
at being Spider-Man right now.

230
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,821
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

231
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,865
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

232
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,556
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Where are you?

233
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,204
- There she is. Amazing Emma Stone.
- The wonderful Emma Stone.

234
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,872
Are those sirens?

235
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,168
It's a shame that she and Andy Garfield
didn't have any chemistry.

236
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,754
- In this film. Right?
- Yeah.

237
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,813
First time I've heard you call him
"Andy."

238
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,175
- Yeah.
- The first time...

239
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,511
Andy Garfield?
Who's Andy Garfield?

240
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,139
Some guy you went to camp with
or is that...?

241
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,100
- Andy Garfield.
- Andy Garfield used to...

242
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,728
beat me up at summer camp.
If you're out there listening, I'm still mad.

243
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,900
That is Cal McCrystal...

244
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,195
who was somebody that Andrew
brought into the production...

245
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,989
who's a sort of an expert
in physical comedy.

246
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,494
- Who's Andrew?
- That's what we call the lead...

247
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,997
of the movie. I... It's...
He goes by a different name with you.

248
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,083
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

249
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,168
and families of my fellow graduates.

250
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,629
He's also named Dean Conway...

251
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,331
named after Gerry Conway...

252
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,759
- ...who was the writer...
- Author of the...

253
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,846
of the Turning Point comic book
that a lot of this movie...

254
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,577
- ...was taken from.
- That's correct.

255
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,516
And in a really strange turn...

256
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,644
Gerry Conway and I worked together
for two years...

257
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,772
on Hercules:
The Legendary Journeys.

258
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,983
And I had no idea
he was the writer of Spider-Man.

259
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,360
And did you not also work
for Sam Raimi doing that?

260
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,654
I did. Sam Raimi gave me my first job.

261
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,505
- Bring it all back.
- Really comes back.

262
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,949
So he gave me my first job...

263
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,560
but it was kind of amazing
because I worked with Gerry...

264
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,622
who, at the time,
was sort of like professor emeritus...

265
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,833
at the office...

266
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,164
and was such a talented writer,
a wonderful guy...

267
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,576
- ...talented writer.
- So cool.

268
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,214
So when this came up and we,
you know...

269
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,925
We started digging into the comics...

270
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,803
to discover he had written it
was an amazing thing, almost...

271
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,306
I don't know, 15 or 20 years later.

272
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,391
So we named him...

273
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,394
- ...after Gerry.
- Very cool.

274
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,646
- Good story, Al.
- Thanks. Thanks, Matt.

275
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,405
- You made that up now, didn't you?
- I actually have no idea who he is.

276
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,112
That Chinese grandfather is actually...

277
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,741
- ...a descendant from the Hans.
- Yes.

278
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,582
I'll take that. That's not yours.

279
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,509
So Rhino tattoos
and a hammer sickle...

280
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,787
- Tat... No.
- Were these boxers...

281
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,638
- Boxers.
...product placement, or?

282
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,598
I'm not sure we had a deal
on the boxers.

283
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,933
I'm sure.

284
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,186
- I think they were actually his. Right?
- And there she is.

285
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,063
Everybody's Aunt May.

286
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,941
- Sets the muster.
- Sally Field.

287
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,567
The spectacular Sally Field.

288
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,612
- Stan Lee.
- Hey, Stan.

289
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,494
Does he ever get tired of doing
cameos? Like, "You know what guys?"

290
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,385
- I don't need to do another."
- "Enough."

291
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,373
"Enough. I've only done
300,000 cameos."

292
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,709
Can't make one of these without him.

293
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,670
He is fun to have around.

294
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,429
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

295
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,643
Avi, when did you...?
When did you start working with Stan?

296
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,728
When did that all begin?

297
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,355
I think in...

298
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:03,110
Working with Stan started, I think,
in '89, '88.

299
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:08,615
- The first comic you were working on?
- First time we met at the Bel-Air Hotel.

300
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,451
- Yeah.
- And...

301
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,955
And I promised him
that within his lifetime...

302
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:19,042
- And he was much younger.
- He's going to do two things:

303
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,796
He's going to see Spider-Man
on the big screen...

304
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,385
and one of these days, we are gonna
do my favorite character.

305
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,876
He said, "It's not Spider-Man?"

306
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,347
I said, "Of course Spider-Man,
but there are others."

307
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,475
He said, "Which one?"
And I said, "Iron Man."

308
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,769
He said, "I love Iron Man."

309
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,981
I said, "You love it so much
that Tony Stark..."

310
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,191
looks exactly like you."

311
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,944
- Did you ever notice it?
- No, I actually didn't.

312
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,905
- Mustache.
- I never made that connection.

313
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,073
Tony Stark is him.

314
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,034
Absolutely him.

315
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,329
Look at the pictures and you'll see.
It's like incredible.

316
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,915
- That's amazing.
- Because it was Howard Hughes.

317
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,846
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

318
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,295
And did he...? Did he envision?

319
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,548
What was his take on sort of the...?

320
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,634
On what Iron Man became.

321
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,761
It's a little bit different than what it was.

322
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,056
Not really. I think...

323
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,059
I think the difference
was that Iron Man at the time...

324
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,352
came in during wartime.

325
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,811
Yeah.

326
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,397
And Iron Man now
came in peacetime...

327
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,818
where guns and battle,
the whole theory of war...

328
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,071
and weapon
and technology changed...

329
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,990
because today,
the bad guys get the same weapon...

330
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,659
- the good guys get.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,328
So the idea in Iron Man
right from the start...

332
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,705
was that...

333
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,833
his dilemma is going to come
from a heartless...

334
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,503
kind of fun guy,
to all of a sudden realizing...

335
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,090
that his own shrapnels...

336
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,008
almost killed him...

337
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,219
in a place in the world
that he didn't think...

338
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,929
- ...he even does business.
- Right.

339
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,432
Stan loved it. Stan is...

340
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,226
a great pacifist.

341
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,311
Just wanna interrupt
this moment here...

342
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,272
- Yes.
...to just reference...

343
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,024
what's happening in the movie.

344
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,652
So that's, obviously, Denis Leary...

345
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,613
playing Captain Stacy.

346
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,450
And this is the moment
where sort of all the reverie...

347
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,828
is interrupted by,
you know, the realization...

348
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,913
that Peter has...

349
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,208
Is essentially faced
with breaking the promise...

350
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,169
that we ended the last movie with...

351
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,964
when he promised Captain Stacy
he would...

352
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,050
not put Gwen in harm's way.

353
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,722
And so it all seemed
like it was lovely and roses...

354
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,268
and now being Spider-Man
has caught up with him...

355
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,061
should we say.

356
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:48,400
And this is a beautiful scene
that we shot in Chinatown...

357
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,571
outside our favorite
Chinese restaurant.

358
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,502
Where we accidentally, one time,
walked out without paying the bill.

359
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,410
- Avi went back the next day.
- Avi had to go back the next day.

360
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,997
So, what was it called?
Oh, my God. It...

361
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,088
I was just there.
It's the greatest restaurant.

362
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,627
While you think about it,
I will say we sat down and...

363
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,255
talked it through with Emma...

364
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,970
It... She said that she felt that she didn't
take enough power in the scene.

365
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,347
Peter had been doing this to her
many, many times.

366
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,766
- Right. Right.
- And we...

367
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,217
And, of course, she was right.

368
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,728
And it was her idea to...
This moment of:

369
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,606
- "I break up with you."
- Right. That was her.

370
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,151
- That was her.
- You're right. "I break up with you."

371
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,820
Joe's Shanghai, by the way,
is the restaurant.

372
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,573
They were shocked
when I came back to pay them.

373
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,984
- Yeah.
- It was unbelievable.

374
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,951
Well, you can only pay cash there.

375
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,162
They only take cash,
and we had somehow...

376
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,248
We'd eaten ourselves into oblivion
and we walked out without paying...

377
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,700
- ...and we didn't remember, so...
- I thought you paid?

378
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,920
- No. I was pretty sure you paid.
- I'm kidding.

379
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,756
The thing that's tricky
about this scene, though...

380
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,718
is that it's one of those weird scenes
where everything seem...

381
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,764
There's clearly so much chemistry
and love between the two of them...

382
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,182
yet they have to break up.

383
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,102
And the audience also has to
be on their side and understand...

384
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,438
why he's doing it without
disliking him or being mad at her.

385
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,407
So we went through
many drafts of the scene...

386
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,070
because it was... There's always
like a couple scenes in a movie...

387
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,656
that you know you're gonna be
rewriting 7000 times.

388
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,242
- And this was definitely one of them.
- Yes. Yeah.

389
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,079
Architecture is built on the movie of...
The architecture of the movie...

390
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,370
is built on their relationship.
You have to start them in the right place.

391
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,334
If you don't, then it just doesn't land.

392
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,710
That's right.

393
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,004
This... So this was a tricky scene.

394
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,175
The unique moment here
is the first time that Gwen Stacy...

395
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,469
- ...is breaking up with him.
- Yeah.

396
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,101
I thought that was
a very well-written moment...

397
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,313
to give Gwen the impetus...

398
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,900
to say, "I think it's over,
so I'm saying goodbye now. That's it."

399
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,819
You cannot keep on doing it to me."

400
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,489
And it's a very strong thing.
Very different than Gwen in the books.

401
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,950
And she points out the dilemma
of his life...

402
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,787
which is... As she says,
she loves that he's Spider-Man.

403
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,914
She loves
that he takes care of the world...

404
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,459
and she recognizes that
that may put her in jeopardy...

405
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,297
but she doesn't mind it,
but she loves Peter, the boy, more.

406
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,467
And sort of that would be the dilemma
if you were a superhero.

407
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,805
- Yeah.
- It's... How do you square...

408
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,223
your regular life...

409
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,475
with your life looking out...

410
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,936
and being responsible
for everybody else?

411
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,356
One of my favorite moments.

412
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,193
Me too.
I always thought the movie...

413
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,028
Yeah. It's... It's really...

414
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,697
It speaks to so much...

415
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,699
about what is so wonderful...

416
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,451
about Spider-Man. But it also...

417
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,494
was one of Andrew's
favorite moments.

418
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,915
Because he, I think, had a lot
of experience being bullied as a kid.

419
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,794
And so one of the early things he had
after our first draft in talking to him...

420
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,526
was, "Wish we could find a way..."

421
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,300
to show that Spider-Man
protects kids from bullies, and..."

422
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,471
It was interesting timing because
it became such a hot-button issue...

423
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,602
- ...right as we were filming the movie.
- Yeah.

424
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,766
Yeah.

425
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,269
But it was really wonderful
because it felt very, very Spider-Man.

426
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,812
Yeah.

427
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,315
That would have been interesting
to see an edit...

428
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,900
starting the movie right here.

429
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,401
Yeah.

430
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,820
Remember that fish
that was from catering that day...

431
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,197
on the set.

432
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,324
This is a Buster Keaton gag.

433
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,815
Andrew and the gentleman who...

434
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,993
- And Cal.
- And Cal.

435
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,870
- Designed that.
- We all talked about...

436
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,874
how amazing Buster Keaton's
physical comedy was.

437
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,043
And so they tried to build
quite a bit of it...

438
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,462
into his...
Into Spider-Man's physicality.

439
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,922
Hey, you're that spider guy.

440
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,215
This guy is great.

441
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,066
- He's great. Great face.
- Guy is great.

442
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:47,138
Usually, I see him hanging
on a wing of a plane.

443
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,682
I love that.

444
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,438
He's not the police,
he's not a fireman.

445
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,311
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

446
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,870
- I'll tell you one thing...
- That's awesome.

447
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,740
...that was... Is really done well
across these movies...

448
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,701
is the costuming for Gwen.

449
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,003
- It's just spectacular.
- Yeah. She really...

450
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,206
- Deb Scott.
- She's the best.

451
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,167
Deb Scott.

452
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,794
Amazingly talented.

453
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,963
She knows he's there.

454
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,173
Isn't that Emma's and Andrew's dog?

455
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,675
- Yes.
- It is their dog.

456
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,176
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

457
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,428
Peter, honey?

458
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,638
Can I come in?

459
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,641
I love this bit.

460
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,893
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

461
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
Good to be a star.

462
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,232
- I wanted my dog there, but...
- You got your dog there.

463
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,123
- Your dog did fine.
- Your dog was there.

464
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,321
- Not in the shot.
- Not in the shot. Well, you could have.

465
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,824
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

466
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,243
No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.

467
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,413
We tried to do this gag
on set, practically, with the boot.

468
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,499
- Remember?
- Very well.

469
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,710
- After 17,000 takes.
- Yeah.

470
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,546
- And then, "Okay, we're going digital."
- It became hot cost.

471
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,964
Yeah.

472
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,467
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

473
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,802
- It is?
- Yes.

474
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,847
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

475
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,932
We have no chimney.

476
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,476
This...

477
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,977
This whole run about the:

478
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,063
- "We have no chimney"?
- Yes.

479
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,994
It was about the garden,
doing something...

480
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,901
- Yes. "I was gardening, I was..."
- Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,611
- Potatoes or something?
- Right.

482
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,404
It's so much fun to...

483
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,115
It's the best thing ever to improvise
with just like...

484
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,784
It's the best. Garfield loves that.

485
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,475
It just keeps everything real fresh.

486
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,706
Yeah. Marc was excited
to have us throw things to him.

487
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,042
And it gives you great options
in the editing room.

488
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,587
- I loved this idea of Marc's, by the way.
- Yeah.

489
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,258
This kind of very, you know, surreal
dreamlike flashback to his childhood.

490
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,594
- Beautiful.
- It was really beautiful.

491
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:55,558
One of the things that I regret here...

492
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,519
and wish we had done more of...

493
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,480
was placing Peter's drive...

494
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,839
to know more about his parents...

495
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,318
a little bit more in the foreground
of the first act.

496
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,613
Because I feel like right around here,
you are starting to kind of feel...

497
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,783
like you're wanting to know
what he's doing...

498
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,618
other than just maintaining.

499
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,287
- And...
- It's something we talked about a lot.

500
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,958
How do you dramatize
somebody actively...

501
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,369
- ...trying to...
- In denial.

502
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,544
- In denial.
- Yeah.

503
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,875
Trying to prove a negative.

504
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,528
- A very tricky thing to do.
- Right.

505
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,759
Here's the great Jamie Foxx.

506
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,770
And this is also one of those things
where...

507
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,306
It's interesting when you have an actor
who's as amazing as Jamie...

508
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,918
a scene where, "You're gonna
introduce your character..."

509
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,646
and they're gonna talk in the mirror
in this really broad...

510
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,941
sort of comical way."
It's either the best idea or the worst.

511
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,192
- Yeah.
- You know?

512
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,069
And Jamie, I think...

513
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,321
brought such kind of
sad humanity to the part...

514
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,198
that it felt like a really...

515
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,353
In his delivery of it,
there's something weirdly profound...

516
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,664
- ...about the introduction of this guy.
- Yeah, it's heartbreaking.

517
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,085
And in a lesser actor's hands, I think
it could have felt, you know, broad.

518
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,753
Yeah. He grounded it.

519
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,132
I remember we did a table read
before we set out into production...

520
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,177
and then Jamie went off
and we were all talking...

521
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,805
- ...and he came back in costume.
- Yeah. Yes. With the gap in his teeth.

522
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,516
With the comb-over,
and he'd just become Max.

523
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,352
And he started talking to us as Max.
He wouldn't break character.

524
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,396
- That's right.
- It was amazing.

525
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,816
That's the other joy of working with
actors like that, you know, who...

526
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,193
Just... They're just...

527
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,778
They go into it.
They chameleon into their...

528
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,949
She's talking to Harvey.

529
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,202
- Weinstein?
- Yeah. That was Harvey.

530
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,872
Double shift on Thursday.

531
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,624
Okay, bye.

532
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:45,862
It was tricky also figuring out...

533
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
like how do you evolve
Aunt May's character?

534
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,133
There's just been so much Aunt May
in all the Spider-Man movies.

535
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,054
So, what do we give her
that's new and fresh and different...

536
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,514
- ...in this movie?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,142
And the idea that she was trying
to work two jobs...

538
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,993
trying to hide one of them
from Peter.

539
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,314
She didn't want him to worry
that she was scrounging for money...

540
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,359
- Yeah.
...felt like a nice evolution...

541
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,610
in her character.

542
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,445
And some of that came out of our...

543
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,156
- Watch the disappearing lettuce. Here.
- Watch the lettuce.

544
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,409
- Lettuce.
- It won't go away for a little while.

545
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,498
Also the idea that we wanted
to introduce that she knew...

546
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,502
or had a very strong suspicion
that Peter was Spider-Man.

547
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,128
We wanted to play that as more...

548
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,298
- There's always that sort of fun...
- Yeah, Aunt May a little...

549
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,677
gray area. That she looks at him
like she's waiting for him to tell her.

550
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,968
I do, and I won't anymore.

551
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,431
But she's also smart enough
not to confront him with it.

552
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,309
- Here it comes.
- Still lettuce. Still lettuce.

553
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,852
- And... Ready?
- Hold.

554
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,230
- Wait for it.
- And...

555
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,065
- No lettuce.
- The lettuce is gone.

556
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,896
That's a very special kind of lettuce
that disappears.

557
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,113
- The disappearing lettuce.
- Yeah.

558
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,950
Max hassled and disrespected.

559
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,664
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

560
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,792
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

561
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,923
Oscorp Industries...

562
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,595
is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

563
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,682
This is a fun idea too...

564
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,019
the idea that Max had submitted
all of his designs to Oscorp...

565
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,310
that they just took it.

566
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,647
And because he was so invisible
and anonymous...

567
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,058
- they steal his things without...
- Take advantage.

568
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,860
- Yeah.
...you know, without him knowing.

569
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,446
- And without any kind of liability.
- Right.

570
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,324
For the entire city's energy supply?

571
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,535
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

572
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,865
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

573
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,663
- B.J. Novak.
- Amazing.

574
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,333
Webb had worked with him
directing an episode of The Office.

575
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,667
- Right.
- They were pals.

576
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,252
So he agreed to do this.

577
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,052
- That amazing... The brilliant...
- That just plays Smythe... What?

578
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,843
That photograph. The big photograph
that was in the lobby...

579
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,095
wasn't that
some special photograph?

580
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,139
It was actually on loan from a gallery.

581
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,266
A very expensive...

582
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,477
Mark Friedberg,
who is our production designer...

583
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,271
- Right.
...did an incredible job.

584
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,802
He really did an incredible job.

585
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,942
And that was something he brought
to the set that day.

586
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,779
Not from his personal collection.

587
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,950
- I love this scene. Very sweet moment.
- I do too.

588
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,412
It's also fun, sort of, when you're...

589
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,206
kind of writing a movie...

590
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,833
where you have all these characters,
to figure out...

591
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,878
how you're gonna bring them
together in an organic way...

592
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,298
sort of finding the, "Wait,
maybe Gwen and Max could actually..."

593
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,634
Just happen into each other
in the elevator...

594
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,245
and then what emerges
from the scene as a result of that.

595
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,351
It becomes a scene
about they're both talking...

596
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,599
- ...about the same character...
- About Spider-Man.

597
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,330
- ...and he doesn't know it...
- Yeah.

598
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,436
Then there's nice double meaning
to the scene.

599
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,208
I love that.
I love the moment where...

600
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,857
- They're both looking at the screen.
- Yeah. Yeah.

601
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,704
And it... But it's... It is that kind of thing
where it's like you...

602
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,613
You wanna try
and bring it back to Spider...

603
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,866
That was always the studio note,
was like, how is it Spider-Man?

604
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,678
- How is it about Spider-Man?
- What's happening with Spider-Man?

605
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,372
- Or Peter.
- And then those kinds of questions...

606
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,063
find their way into answers like:

607
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,459
"Then he appears,
suddenly they're talking about him."

608
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,751
- What do these two have in common?
- Yeah. Exactly.

609
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,340
Sixty-third floor.

610
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,843
It was nice to meet you, Max.

611
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,556
Wait. She remembered my name.

612
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:35,273
So I think this was one
of our more radical ideas in the film...

613
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,984
was to posit...

614
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:42,530
that Harry Osborn
was the Green Goblin and not Norman.

615
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,160
Fortunately, we found
this spectacular actor in Dane.

616
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,914
And we certainly knew it would be
a very controversial choice...

617
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,668
to kill Norman Osborn
in his introductory scene.

618
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,671
It's dark in there.

619
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,882
Your eyes will adjust.

620
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,176
That being said...

621
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,095
maybe he's not really dead.
We're sort of keeping the lights on.

622
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,866
- One does not know.
- Yeah. Who knows?

623
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,735
There may be a scene
we didn't show anybody.

624
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:10,975
There might be.

625
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,186
There might be a scene.

626
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,437
The great Chris Cooper.

627
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,689
- Might be a reason to see another one.
- Yeah.

628
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,859
Will you speak a little about this day?

629
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,737
And the performance
that Marc got out of Chris here?

630
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,697
Oh, it was incredibly powerful to see...

631
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,867
you know, such an incredible,
world-class actor.

632
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,955
And it was really...
It was sort of a master class...

633
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,166
between Webb and Chris Cooper.

634
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,336
And we were all standing there
watching.

635
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,713
He started reading the line
much more...

636
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,173
Webb really...

637
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,384
I mean, it was sort of a beautiful
collaboration between the two of them.

638
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:50,348
And, you know, getting him to a place
where he's having...

639
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,892
this sort of brutally honest...

640
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,978
hate-love-filled conversation
with this son...

641
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,900
who he knows he's treated poorly,
but feels he's done it for a reason.

642
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,821
There are so many sort of layers
to this scene, and...

643
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:12,787
And one of the very fine dances
that has to be taken...

644
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,872
in a superhero movie...

645
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,335
is you want the characters
to be slightly...

646
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,878
larger than life.

647
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,006
And at the same point, you need
to keep them in the reality of the film.

648
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,258
- Yeah.
- In the world.

649
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,801
That was always the idea.

650
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,598
And you can see his...
The disease has...

651
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,810
Has really matured in Norman.

652
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:42,024
And Harry has no idea what his
sort of, quote-unquote, "legacy" is.

653
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,569
And Norman calls him out.

654
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,781
It's the beginning of sort of
the horrific chapter for Harry.

655
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,034
But when you find sort of a...
When you're breaking a story...

656
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,287
and, you know,
everyone sort of agrees like:

657
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,622
"Oh, this would be a great way
to introduce...

658
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,293
the character, both characters,"
it becomes this incredible gift.

659
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,045
Because, suddenly, the challenge...

660
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,550
as writers, is to say, "Okay, we have
a lot to accomplish in one scene."

661
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,218
And it has to set up...

662
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,096
A little like we were saying
with the Peter-Gwen breakup scene...

663
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,474
it has to set up the entire context
for their relationship...

664
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,437
but also propel Harry forward
into his drive for the movie...

665
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,691
but be loaded with all
of this subtext, and... And...

666
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,988
And at the same time, you've got, you
know, a father who looks like a goblin.

667
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,491
That's also...
There was a larger idea about sort of...

668
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:36,162
you know, the sins of the fathers.

669
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,291
And, you know, it's a bit of a parallel
to Peter's story.

670
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,464
- Mysterious mythic father figures who...
- Yeah.

671
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,508
Who ultimately were never there
for their sons.

672
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,178
And the work...
And we spent a lot of time talking...

673
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,097
about how the work
that these two men did...

674
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,309
both to better the world, and then
in order to save Norman's life...

675
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,978
really played consequences
in their sons' lives.

676
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,396
It defines them.

677
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,233
In many ways for both boys, the film
is about a search for their father.

678
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,568
That's right.

679
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,697
And a search to come to terms
with the legacy of their fathers.

680
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,702
Avi, didn't you wanna call it
Sins of the Father at one point?

681
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,194
Was that based on a comic book?

682
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,133
We talked about calling
the last movie that.

683
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:24,585
No. That's something that
we wanted to do on the last one.

684
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,964
We felt that as we are making
a new Spider-Man...

685
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,550
we needed to...

686
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,011
To be provocative.

687
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,641
And kind of Sins of the Father is...

688
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,309
intelligent, intellectual...

689
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,895
and thought-provoking.

690
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:47,692
And we felt that
the movie will get more attention.

691
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,444
Oh, I see. You wanted to do it
for the first... For the...

692
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,947
- For the first Amazing Spider-Man.
- For the last movie.

693
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,657
- Got it.
- The Sins of the Father...

694
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,159
was not a comic.

695
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:02,456
But this movie had
a very specific connection...

696
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,209
to the sins of the father, of the idea.

697
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,755
It begins with hard work.

698
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,426
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

699
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,179
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

700
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,684
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

701
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,602
But not today.

702
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,814
In this moment, another one
of the threads of the film is set up.

703
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,194
This idea that Gwen has an opportunity
to go off to Oxford and study.

704
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,406
And, in fact, what became our secret
name for the film was London Calling.

705
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,744
London Calling, that was actually
the production name of the movie.

706
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,873
If you came to visit us on the set,
the signs said London Calling.

707
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,044
Because you've gotta be careful
not to advertise.

708
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,044
Designed like
the London Underground?

709
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,295
Correct.

710
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,921
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

711
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,715
Happy birthday.

712
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,473
Now, the Electro eels did come from...

713
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,892
an anim... I think the idea...

714
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,061
was from an animated originally.

715
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,353
Yeah? Right, Avi?

716
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,856
- Yep.
- And...

717
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,275
And it just felt like kind of the perfect...

718
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,820
The perfect way
into making him Electro.

719
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,032
- It's actually... It's good pseudoscience.
- Yeah, exactly.

720
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,284
- Especially a multitude of them.
- Yeah.

721
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,538
I actually just watched a nature show...

722
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,083
about the hunt...

723
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,920
- ...for this sort of mythic electric eel...
- Yeah.

724
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,340
...that was burning people,
like literally charring their bodies.

725
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,636
And they showed footage of a...
This was crazy.

726
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,721
Of an alligator...

727
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,599
- ...biting an enormous electric eel...
- And getting fried?

728
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,490
- ...and getting completely fried.
- Yeah.

729
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,354
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- You see his body just sort of shake.

730
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,023
The power of those things
is unbelievable.

731
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,776
Did he come back to life,
turn into an evil alligator?

732
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,736
He turned into Electro, the alligator.

733
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,323
- Allectro.
- He became the Lizard.

734
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,326
Exactly. He became the Lizard.

735
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,370
No. That did not happen.

736
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,998
So for the record, can anyone
listening to this go pitch that movie?

737
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,377
- No. We own that. We own that.
- Okay. Just to be clear.

738
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,258
Well, I think it just spoke to sort of the...

739
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,011
The horrible genetic experiments
that were being run at Oscorp.

740
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,721
And with very little oversight.

741
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,673
- Love this shot.
- Great shot.

742
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,393
Remember, this was Colin
on the descender rig falling.

743
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,020
- It's three shots cut into one, right?
- Yep, that's right.

744
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:35,109
This took a long time to build, this...
To really make it right.

745
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,196
And we had several conversations
what...

746
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,991
What pushes it too far
and makes it too scary.

747
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,492
Yeah. We had to dial this...

748
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,786
back and forth
a number of times to get it...

749
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,874
so that it was... It was...
It was enough, but not too much.

750
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,001
System restored.

751
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,627
Have a nice day.

752
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,588
Harry...

753
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,759
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

754
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,092
in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

755
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,427
breach of trust.

756
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:02,849
You mean people are pissed off...

757
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,519
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

758
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,849
Our boy from Brazil?

759
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,142
- Right?
- That's right.

760
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,602
Given that...

761
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,896
all the animal hybrid programs
he was...

762
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,606
"Be that as it may..."

763
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,692
"Given that..."

764
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,447
This was a fun scene to write
because it's always fun...

765
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,200
to put a 20-year-old kid
at the head of a corporation...

766
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,251
with a bunch of attorneys and
figure out how that scene is gonna go.

767
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,080
And it was also...
I think part of what was fun about this...

768
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:35,544
and necessary about it was showing
that he was such a cunning guy...

769
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,421
before he becomes the Goblin.

770
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,634
You know, when his dad refers to his
fierce intelligence, I think the idea of...

771
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,303
It was... The fun of writing this scene...

772
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,974
was finding a way to show
that he could outsmart...

773
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,144
even the toughest lawyers
in the room.

774
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,940
And, simultaneously, that he knows
he's under a great deal of pressure.

775
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,401
Yeah. There's a self-awareness
about him that was interesting too.

776
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,696
He's very aware that he's probably
surrounded by a bunch of people...

777
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,741
that would way rather him
not be there.

778
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,619
- Her name was not Felicia in the script.
- No.

779
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,288
And it was like...

780
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,540
an on-the-day change
somehow, right?

781
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,112
- What was the...?
- Was actually somebody at the studio...

782
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,295
- ...made that suggestion.
- Right.

783
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,174
- Nod to the comic.
- As a nod to the comic and an option.

784
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,969
- Right.
- And we thought it was a fun idea.

785
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,557
Because Felicia works for me.

786
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,894
Would anybody like to speak up?

787
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,525
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

788
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,154
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

789
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,582
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

790
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,210
Every single one.

791
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,213
The next scene is one
that we actually used to audition...

792
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,882
- Yeah. Dane.
...Dane for...

793
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,385
We auditioned Harry Osborns.

794
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,097
And it was a scene that these
two guys who had never met...

795
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,100
let alone worked together,
really, really connected over.

796
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,019
What was cool about it too, though,
was...

797
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,813
Matt, I remember you
talking about this quite a bit too.

798
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,191
Because in the previous iterations...

799
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,527
- ...of Spider-Man, he...
- Yeah.

800
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,323
This was a sort of re-contextualization
of their relationship.

801
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,494
- Right.
- Different. They hadn't been friends...

802
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,369
since they were children together.
When their fathers were...

803
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,496
- A new element we were bringing in.
- Right.

804
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,251
And it was interesting
because trying to, again...

805
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:44,048
like, figure out a way to
layer the scene with all of that...

806
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,467
- ...and not have it feel like exposition.
- Yeah.

807
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,803
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

808
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:53,682
- If you remember a flashback...
- Where they were playing chess.

809
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,310
- The day of his parents' funeral.
- It was quite a while.

810
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,241
- Where you actually saw him.
- Yeah. Yeah.

811
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,190
I think you saw him and Norman.

812
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,567
Yes, it was a cool scene.
The scene was...

813
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,569
It was a very cool scene. It was the...

814
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,155
It was at the fu... At the wake...

815
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,086
- ...of Peter's parents.
- Peter's parents.

816
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,620
And Peter was sort of this lonely child
in this room of adults.

817
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,706
- That's right.
- And he snuck off to his dad's study...

818
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,918
and in walked Harry,
and Harry said...

819
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,921
They started playing chess,
and it was kind of a metaphor.

820
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,298
And I can't remember
the exact dialogue.

821
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,425
But it was this kind of lovely moment...

822
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,761
of these boys connecting
and finding...

823
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,430
each other.
And then in the doorway...

824
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,725
And their relationship had all been
about going to their fathers' labs.

825
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,456
- Watching their dads' work.
- Watching their dads' experiment.

826
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,813
But you saw Norman...

827
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,606
- In the doorway.
...watching the boys.

828
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,235
Right, it buttoned with they turn, and
there's this sort of silhouetted man...

829
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,530
at the beginning of his degenerative
disease in the doorway...

830
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,864
holding onto this cane.

831
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:55,035
And it was a pretty cool,
sort of weird, creepy scene.

832
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,162
It was also one of those scenes
that you go...

833
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,208
Well... Do we really need this
to tell the story?

834
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,669
Do you really need all that back-story?

835
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,881
This was the first scene shot
on the High Line.

836
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,688
- This was not actually the High Line.
- No, it's not the High Line.

837
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,470
This is on the water in Brooklyn.

838
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,180
- Right by DUMBO.
- Yeah.

839
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,266
Not the first scene shot
on the High Line.

840
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,557
- The last scene shot on the High Line.
- The Gwen and Peter walk-and-talk...

841
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,648
- ...before.
- There is a scene on the High Line.

842
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,614
- It comes later.
- What's funny about that...

843
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,234
is that we went to see Andrew
in New York...

844
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,320
the first time I met him.

845
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,783
And just to sort of talk to him
and tell him about the story.

846
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,620
And right before I met him...

847
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,582
I took a walk on the High Line,
which was pretty new.

848
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,960
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And it's just so spectacular.

849
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,587
Who is she?

850
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,963
Her name's Gwen.

851
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,882
Gwen Stacy.

852
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,385
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

853
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,095
Really? She works for me?

854
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,640
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

855
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,871
You know, when my father
sent me away...

856
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,299
It's so funny, like these are two kids
from different pl...

857
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,242
The same neighborhood,
but different planets.

858
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,740
The tough part
about this whole section of it...

859
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,698
is just the sheer volume
of information...

860
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:19,328
that you need to get across
without having it feel...

861
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,748
- Expositional. Yeah.
- Exposition-y. Like it had to be rooted...

862
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,292
in this emotional reconnection
these boys were having.

863
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,793
Yeah.

864
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,880
And the idea
that really held it all together...

865
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,633
was that they both had
all these questions about their dad.

866
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,718
That they both,
as you were saying earlier...

867
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
were very much orphaned
by their fathers...

868
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,139
in different specific contexts.

869
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,141
That's the real link between them.

870
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,810
And this is a scene
that even after written...

871
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,355
and shot, we went back and forth
on several times.

872
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,066
How much information
needed to be in the movie.

873
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,902
Andrew Garfield is one of the great...

874
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,321
rock skimmers of our time.

875
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,989
So that was all done practically.

876
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,118
- That was, what, 200 skips?
- Yeah, 250.

877
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,246
- Two-fifty.
- Yeah.

878
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,580
I've seen you skip a rock.

879
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,709
- I can skip it like 180, 185 times.
- Yeah, Tolmach can skip a rock.

880
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,881
- I actually can.
- He's... I know, I've seen it.

881
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,215
Yeah. I come from a long line
of rock skippers, yeah.

882
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,346
- That's what they did for a living?
- Your people don't skip rocks well.

883
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,679
- My people? No.
- You have other talents.

884
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,974
- You're just not good at that.
- No. We sink rocks. We don't do...

885
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,892
For what?

886
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,853
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

887
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,523
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

888
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,820
Who was he?

889
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,823
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

890
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,826
No associates or friends to speak of.

891
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,666
And the tricky part was always just,
when you have all these characters...

892
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,637
- ...how do you balance them all...
- Right.

893
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,129
...and keep weaving the story lines
back to each other...

894
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,799
without it feeling somehow
like you're on a random path?

895
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,178
Right. And so here's the two kids
just trying to be kids and connect...

896
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,723
- ...then the sinister hand of Oscorp.
- Yep.

897
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:06,476
- Sort of sucking them back in.
- In everybody's business.

898
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,895
And being told about Max,
which brings you back to Max.

899
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,522
That's right.

900
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,364
Another scene that went through
many versions in the edit.

901
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,284
- Because it was really scary.
- This was a much longer scene.

902
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,995
And a very funny comedian
who was actually the...

903
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,497
The morgue technician.

904
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:30,751
Yep. Who got fried
when he touched Electro.

905
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,962
Yeah. He had a funny little bit at
the beginning where he took a bribe...

906
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,217
from the Man in the Black Suit that
you saw in the car to keep this all quiet.

907
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,637
But, again, it was just...

908
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,306
You get to that place where you need...

909
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,183
You need what you need.

910
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,603
- And so that will be in the DVD extras.
- Yeah.

911
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,484
- Or it will now.
- Yeah.

912
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:01,406
Yeah. I loved Marc's ideas that his skin
sort of molted off him like a snake.

913
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,138
- That's right. Yeah.
- And that he...

914
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,160
- The outer shell was charred.
- Yeah.

915
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,913
And I think the CG done to...

916
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,832
- Masterfully.
- Masterfully.

917
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672
Hey.

918
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,052
- This piece of music...
- Oh, this is great.

919
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,888
- Phosphorescent, I think.
- Great moment.

920
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,849
And this music
that Marc added existed...

921
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,227
- ...in every single version of the film.
- Yeah.

922
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,998
Had it in his head from the beginning.

923
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,357
This is that real
(500) Days of Summer MarcWebb.

924
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,651
- "Song for Zula."
- A language he knows very well.

925
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,742
We talked about this
as the "Frogger" moment...

926
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,387
- ...when he crosses the street like this.
- I love that he actually clips the mirror.

927
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,201
- I know. And doesn't even notice.
- Right.

928
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,828
Because all he can see is her.

929
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,081
By the way, it was freezing cold
in Union Square when we shot this.

930
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,958
- It doesn't look it.
- I know.

931
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,002
- No, there's no...
- If you cut away to me and Avi...

932
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,630
you would know.
We were quite miserable.

933
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,841
Huddled around a little heater.

934
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,136
You wouldn't know it with these two.

935
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,847
This was another one
of those scenes...

936
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,808
that there's a version that goes on
for four minutes more.

937
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,339
- Right.
- It's utterly charming.

938
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,879
- Yup.
- I just love watching them.

939
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,397
Spontaneous...

940
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,232
is all right. You know.

941
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,901
Well, I just figured it was time.

942
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,279
You know?

943
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,448
Time that we try to be friends.

944
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:26,950
Yeah.

945
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,204
Friends, yeah. That's...

946
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,331
great.

947
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,834
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

948
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,253
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

949
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,088
Keep it simple.

950
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,050
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

951
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,552
Well, I mean...

952
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,601
And it's... This is one of those things
where you realize...

953
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:56,897
the relationship between them,
more than anything else in this movie...

954
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,668
is the heart and soul of the movie.

955
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,193
Where we know what's gonna end up
happening to her...

956
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,403
- Amen.
...that all of these scenes...

957
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,781
became the most important.

958
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,868
The hardest in the editing room,
ultimately the most important.

959
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,746
- Well, given where the movie goes.
- Yep.

960
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,457
Every one of them had to sort of fire
on all cylinders.

961
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,251
- That's right.
- They all add up to a conclusion.

962
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:22,130
And they're all about
Peter's sort of step...

963
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,662
into real adulthood,
I think, at the end of this movie.

964
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,764
In a way that he had not
in the previous movies.

965
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,011
Right.

966
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,014
This is also hugely important,
this moment...

967
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,727
because, you know,
Peter is filled with hope...

968
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,104
and, you know,
Gwen has called him.

969
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,857
And I think he's thinking
maybe possibly...

970
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,568
there's a way
we could figure this out.

971
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,620
You know,
we find out he's been following her.

972
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,490
And then at the end of the scene,
on the High Line, Jeff...

973
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,951
- ...which is coming up...
- On the what?

974
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,829
- The High Line.
- They were on the High Line earlier.

975
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,706
- No, actually they were not.
- Oh, that was...

976
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,838
- That was the waterfront.
- That was the river.

977
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,877
She drops the big bomb on him.

978
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:06,007
Which is, you know... Sort of becomes
the motor for much of the movie...

979
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,844
which is that she's leaving.

980
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,179
And now he's gotta deal with that.

981
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,807
And figure out what he's gonna do.

982
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,311
While simultaneously, Electro...

983
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,648
Right. Again, it's that thing Alex
was talking about earlier. It all has to...

984
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,526
Ultimately, you wanna find as many
opportunities in the movie...

985
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:28,446
as you can
where his personal life and...

986
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,258
his needs and wants as a teenager...

987
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,034
are in conflict with his...
The fact that he's Spider-Man.

988
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,828
That's right.

989
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,615
- That is the High Line.
- Jeff, you know what that is?

990
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,542
- Yeah.
- That's the waterfront.

991
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,256
- Jeff's never been to New York.
- It's the Baltimore waterfront.

992
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,009
- It's the inner harbor.
- You should go to New York, Jeff.

993
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,860
- It's a lovely place.
- I love New York.

994
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,175
- If only the Yankees didn't play there.
- Filled with wonderful things to do.

995
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,558
How do you know I love it there?

996
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,518
Because...

997
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,397
Because you told me.

998
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,190
Meatballs.

999
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,735
- Korean meatballs.
- Yep.

1000
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,780
It was very important
that the movie film in New York...

1001
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,241
- ...in its entirety as well.
- Correct.

1002
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,745
- Big tax break.
- Also for story it was important.

1003
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,081
See, that was us
playing our different roles there.

1004
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,000
How often?

1005
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,585
- Cheap is what it was.
- Matt Tolmach, producer...

1006
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,421
- ...ladies and gentlemen.
- That's right.

1007
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,091
- Doing my job, fellas.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1008
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:35,347
- Where are they in this moment?
- On the High Line.

1009
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,892
Oh, boy.

1010
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,393
Why?

1011
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,939
God, her performance here, man,
when he tells her.

1012
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,483
She's just so spectacular
in that moment.

1013
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,194
- And...
- And what?

1014
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,864
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

1015
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,212
I'm moving to England.

1016
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,846
What?

1017
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,807
Yeah.

1018
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,852
I have a...
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

1019
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,772
In molecular medicine.

1020
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,692
I think that,
you know, when we decided...

1021
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,402
to tell the Gwen Stacy story...

1022
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,655
you know, in the previous movie,
you always know that...

1023
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,991
You know where it ends.

1024
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,201
And you sort of try to deny it.

1025
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,786
And it's hard to imagine with...

1026
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,498
Working with somebody
that we love as much as Emma.

1027
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,335
It's hard to fathom
even just parting company...

1028
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,629
with somebody that
you love working with so much.

1029
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,716
But you know that if you're gonna
do right by the story...

1030
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,427
that's where you're gonna end up.
It was, you know...

1031
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,848
Avi and I go back a long way
on these Spider-Man movies.

1032
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,475
And I used to be a studio executive...

1033
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,396
working on them with Avi.
And we were talking about...

1034
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,065
the death of Gwen Stacy,
The Night Gwen Stacy Died.

1035
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,443
How many years ago?
Twelve? Fourteen?

1036
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,153
- Twelve years ago.
- Yeah.

1037
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,406
And if I can cut in for one instant,
most of the people watching this...

1038
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:20,076
probably know that the death
of Gwen Stacy was one of the more...

1039
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,205
if not the most, famous story
in the golden age of comic books.

1040
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,832
Considered the gold standard.

1041
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,001
It was the first time the hero failed...

1042
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,046
- ...and failed tragically.
- That's right.

1043
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,111
Avi, why did Turning Point...

1044
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,573
become such a famous...

1045
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,367
and important comic in the moment?

1046
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:06,664
At the time,
it was the impression that...

1047
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:11,086
that was his real first love,
his biggest love.

1048
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:15,173
And that ran for like nine months,
something like that.

1049
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,674
It became...

1050
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,846
It was in the early days
where I think it was some...

1051
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,766
Romance was more naive...

1052
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,559
really more about love.

1053
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,145
It wasn't about sex and drugs.

1054
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,232
And it was really a very clean...

1055
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,317
- ...amazing relationship...
- Yeah.

1056
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,153
...that comic book readers...

1057
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,739
related to very deeply...

1058
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,407
because he was this geek guy...

1059
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,994
...and she was
this incredible-looking girl.

1060
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:48,373
At the time, there was
no emphasis on her wisdom...

1061
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,916
and education and so on.

1062
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,129
It was just that
she was like a knockout.

1063
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,466
And the fact that it was...

1064
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,514
It was totally unexpected,
the death of Gwen Stacy.

1065
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,349
It was like one of these things.

1066
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,769
And the effect of it was, like, wild.
Like someone...

1067
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,313
Someone real just died.

1068
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:15,567
- Yeah.
- And... And I mean...

1069
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,903
people made condolence notes...

1070
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,864
and funeral announcements.

1071
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,449
It was like...

1072
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,494
- ...the Jean Grey wedding.
- Right.

1073
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,831
So for whatever reason...

1074
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,041
it became like one of the first...

1075
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,713
Maybe it's still the only time...

1076
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,133
that the readers
had their hearts broken...

1077
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,011
because it was so well-done.

1078
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:47,348
The days that Stan
edited the comics...

1079
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,437
it was all very emotional, very clean.

1080
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,482
And the whole world
was in love with her.

1081
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,694
It's like the movie Pretty Woman,
you know.

1082
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,572
We all fell in love with Julia Roberts.

1083
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,657
She was real.

1084
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,242
And that's what happened here.

1085
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,995
So it became a seminal...

1086
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,288
You don't remember me?

1087
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:14,000
People who see the movie
and they're like true believers...

1088
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,421
who are really more from
that time of comic readers...

1089
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,507
probably the most impressive thing
for them in the movie...

1090
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,218
was seeing that the clock...

1091
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:27,347
showed the same time
that it was in the comic.

1092
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:32,894
That's how emotionally involved
they were...

1093
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,187
with this comic.

1094
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,692
And in movie one,
when we decided to...

1095
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,694
Basically it was...

1096
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,113
- It was the same thing.
- It was the same thing.

1097
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,532
But it was done with Mary Jane.

1098
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,953
- With a happy ending.
- Because believe it or not, at the time...

1099
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,747
And actually, it was a good choice
at the time.

1100
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,500
Mary Jane had...

1101
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,544
more of the Spider-Man lore...

1102
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:02,423
in terms of that she was
in love actually with Spider-Man.

1103
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:06,094
And she didn't know who is Peter.

1104
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:10,265
Peter was just someone
that kind of she liked, you know.

1105
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,893
He was a good tutor and a nice guy.

1106
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,230
But she was madly in love
with Spider-Man.

1107
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,983
If we went with Gwen...

1108
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,610
it would have been
a smaller story in a way.

1109
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:27,031
So... And obviously
we didn't kill her over the bridge.

1110
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,200
- Yeah.
- We saved her.

1111
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,370
So there was no outcry at all.

1112
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:33,663
They loved it.

1113
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,248
No! No! Stop!

1114
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,128
Max!

1115
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,714
So this is the sort of that...

1116
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,800
Was designed as the kind of
signature set piece.

1117
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,137
It was...
From a production standpoint...

1118
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,391
it was a colossal undertaking
to actually build Times Square.

1119
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,352
Because you obviously can't do
what you're seeing on screen...

1120
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,480
in the actual Times Square.
That would be bad for Times Square.

1121
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,859
So we had to reconstruct
the entire thing...

1122
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,028
down to every detail...

1123
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:09,741
both practically in Long Island
on a backlot...

1124
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,368
and then in the computer.

1125
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,899
Kind of amazing when you see it.

1126
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,338
I think the death of...

1127
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,382
Going back to the death of Gwen Stacy
for a second. The...

1128
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,012
I think we were just so stunned that
that's what everybody wanted to do...

1129
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,388
when it was sort of presented...

1130
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,641
because it was such a complicated
and difficult challenge.

1131
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,561
The movie was immediately
about something really emotional...

1132
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,563
and powerful and difficult.

1133
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,982
You know, everybody
who sees the first Spider-Man...

1134
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,486
falls in love with Andrew and Emma
because they're so wonderful.

1135
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,739
And so you...
I think our first reaction was:

1136
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,241
"You wanna kill?

1137
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:55,036
You wanna kill America's sweetheart?"

1138
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,038
How are you gonna do that
in a big movie...

1139
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,849
and have people walk out of
the theater feeling good about it?

1140
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,126
And it seemed like
an impossible challenge...

1141
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:05,129
but I think that's part of what
really intrigued us about it.

1142
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,839
And I do think, ultimately...

1143
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,133
a big part of what
got us excited about it was...

1144
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,180
it would make it a very different
kind of Spider-Man movie.

1145
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,932
Just by nature, it had to be.

1146
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,725
And it was also really clear that...

1147
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,770
not one thing in the movie...

1148
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,314
Her death at the end
couldn't be an accidental thing.

1149
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,900
It needed to be that everything
in the movie was kind of...

1150
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,610
leading you up to that...

1151
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,612
with real inevitability.

1152
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,535
And so it was a very challenging
and sort of scary compass to follow...

1153
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,746
but I think one
that we were excited to follow.

1154
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,957
But also a tough needle to thread
in the sense that, you know...

1155
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,334
Gwen's death was always...

1156
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,294
something that hung over Peter...

1157
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,879
- ...and over Spider-Man.
- Yep.

1158
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,173
Because had he not
been Spider-Man...

1159
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:53,386
had he not been involved with her
in the comics...

1160
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,264
had the Goblin not figured that out...

1161
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:57,932
she wouldn't have died.

1162
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:03,312
And at the same time,
you guys took great pains...

1163
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,941
and I think very wisely,
to also make her somebody...

1164
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,272
who wasn't a victim of circumstance
in this movie.

1165
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,086
- That's right.
- She also had her own...

1166
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,989
- Yes.
- Her own agenda.

1167
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,616
And so her death...

1168
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:19,579
actually became a slightly
more complicated balancing act.

1169
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:27,295
And from the end point,
the idea that Gwen was going to die...

1170
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,797
there were certain narrative things.

1171
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,676
One being the idea that the Goblin
was the one responsible for her death.

1172
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,970
And it became important to us...

1173
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,515
that we tell an origin story
about the Goblin.

1174
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,933
And that he not become...

1175
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,436
Harry not become the Goblin
by the end of the first act.

1176
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:48,149
- That's right.
- Which then led to the necessity...

1177
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,277
to tell the story about
Max Dillon-Electro as well.

1178
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,696
- Yeah.
- And equally...

1179
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,158
if not more importantly, we knew
that we really wanted this movie...

1180
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,493
to be a love story.

1181
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,786
And we wanted to honor the place...

1182
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,873
that they ended up
at the end of the last movie.

1183
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,335
The promise that Peter had made
to Gwen's dad...

1184
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,671
that he wouldn't allow her
to be injured...

1185
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,882
- ...because she was in his orbit.
- Right.

1186
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,218
- Mike. Big John.
- Yeah.

1187
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,720
But, to me, the scene that made...

1188
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,765
the death of Gwen Stacy work...

1189
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:25,228
was the scene later with the box.

1190
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,772
I think without...

1191
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,316
- At the end of the movie. Yeah.
- At the end.

1192
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,817
Without the box scene...

1193
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,321
I think it would have left...

1194
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,783
- ...a bitter taste.
- Yeah.

1195
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,869
It would have left a bitter taste
with the audience and with Peter.

1196
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,205
That was always the question,
like, how do you...?

1197
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,290
What do you do with it? How do you...?

1198
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,376
How do you allow people
to leave the theater?

1199
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,045
How do you move past the death of?

1200
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,588
And how does he move past it?

1201
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,507
That allows the audience
to move past it.

1202
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,759
I don't know anybody
who didn't walk out...

1203
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,679
from a place with a brown box
at one time or another.

1204
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,472
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,016
Never in great circumstances.

1206
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,979
And, as always, trying to do it with,
you know, a great degree of honesty.

1207
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,313
Yeah.

1208
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,525
I remember once talking to...

1209
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,528
I can't remember who it was.

1210
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,196
It might have been Bill Broyles...

1211
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,127
or someone who was involved
in CastAway.

1212
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,451
And at the end of CastAway...

1213
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,720
The ending just didn't test well at all.

1214
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,749
Like, in their first rounds of it,
everybody loved the movie.

1215
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,376
They just didn't like the ending.

1216
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,713
And they really struggled
over what to do...

1217
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,257
because you had this very...

1218
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,926
unhappy ending, you know.
And I think...

1219
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,304
someone told me the story once...

1220
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,598
that Zemeckis said something like:

1221
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,601
"Sometimes you just have to tell people
what the movie is about."

1222
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,186
And they did some ending...

1223
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,731
so I don't remember
which scene specifically...

1224
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,775
but they put this ending scene
that kind of summarized:

1225
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,737
Okay, this is really painful,
but this is also what life is about.

1226
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,363
And you get to certain moments.

1227
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,455
There's a road, you decide
which path you take.

1228
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:03,951
But we all end up on that road
one day or another.

1229
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,453
And it tested through the roof.

1230
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,705
And CastAway became CastAway.

1231
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,166
Because they allowed the message
to be transparent.

1232
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,917
To be clear. It goes back...

1233
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,837
to the question that challenged us...

1234
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,923
in saying, "Yes, we wanted
to write the movie in the first place."

1235
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,886
Which is, how do you
get the audience...

1236
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,346
to feel by the end...

1237
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,182
that he's moved through
the experience of this?

1238
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,309
You're never gonna tell them
her death is okay.

1239
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,280
- It's not.
- They're never gonna feel that.

1240
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:33,814
And so giving them a false,
"Oh, no, it's okay, she died...

1241
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,692
because she had to die,
so he could become Spider-Man."

1242
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,945
That wouldn't play.

1243
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,657
And so I think the box scene...

1244
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,494
is really a moment...

1245
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,829
where I think we kind of realized...

1246
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,707
that we needed to tell the audience
what the movie was about...

1247
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,918
and say that these are...

1248
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,880
As you just said, everybody ends up
holding a box at some point in their life.

1249
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,924
Having to decide
what they're gonna do.

1250
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:04,095
And I think it allowed us to feel
that Peter was...

1251
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,057
if not over it,
understanding where to put it...

1252
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,725
how to move on and grow from it.

1253
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,477
It was about "take it with you."

1254
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,646
- Right.
- And... And...

1255
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,441
And actually that,
if you looked at the audience...

1256
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:22,113
the box scene is when
they had the opportunity...

1257
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,031
- ...to let the tears out.
- Yes.

1258
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,742
- It was...
- And one of the things we decided...

1259
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,328
One of the things we decided
very early on...

1260
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,539
Because I think they all remember...

1261
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,542
- ...the moments in their lives...
- Right.

1262
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,294
...when they had to take the box...

1263
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:41,632
when they were fired
or when they lost their lease...

1264
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,884
they couldn't pay a bill...

1265
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,390
clean up after
loved ones that passed.

1266
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,517
I mean, we all been there.

1267
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,808
And I think the moment
the audience got with that...

1268
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,940
they understood. They benefited,
in a way, from a very tough scene.

1269
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,525
Yeah. And...

1270
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,653
Also, who hasn't popped a pimple
on their desk?

1271
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,029
- Who has not done that?
- Great contribution, Matt.

1272
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,868
Who has not popped a pimple
on their desk also?

1273
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,164
- This is one of these relatable...
- That is brilliant.

1274
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,792
The only thing I miss
is the pimple flying...

1275
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,627
into the screen in 3D.

1276
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:21,714
I think we shot it a bunch of times.
The audience didn't like it.

1277
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,550
Can you imagine if it came
to the audience in 3D and splattered?

1278
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,051
John Belushi in Animal House.

1279
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,063
- "What am I now? I'm a zit."
- That's right.

1280
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,473
- "A zit."
- A really classy idea.

1281
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,892
No, but one of the ideas
that we talked about...

1282
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,227
from very early on
was this notion of time...

1283
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,729
and how fleeting time is.

1284
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,689
That the people
that come into your life...

1285
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,108
and the moments
that are really valuable...

1286
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,154
are partly valuable
because they don't last.

1287
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,822
And that's what makes...

1288
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,325
- That's what gives life its meaning.
- That's the theme.

1289
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,456
It's why the movie opens
on a clock, on a watch.

1290
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,748
- And why she dies in a clock tower.
- Yes, Jeff.

1291
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,793
- Is that why we did that?
- We're making things clear here.

1292
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,797
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

1293
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,382
the battery might explode!

1294
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,218
Explode!

1295
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,890
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

1296
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,266
You're not invincible.

1297
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,435
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

1298
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,979
The theme could have been pimples.

1299
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,272
Well, we talked about it.

1300
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,651
We talked about it.
It just, you know, didn't test as well.

1301
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,987
- We had the teenage boy audience.
- Yeah.

1302
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,532
One quad.

1303
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,283
Big, though.

1304
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,454
Couldn't get the acne medicine tie-in.
Didn't make sense.

1305
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,128
- This is a great moment.
- I love that.

1306
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,422
Double shot.
That's where we always get the laugh.

1307
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,967
- That's the laugh. The second one.
- The second one.

1308
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,018
You're starting to get the laugh
on the first.

1309
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:52,179
But then you really get it.

1310
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,311
- Hello.
- Pete.

1311
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,188
It's me.

1312
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,148
Hey, Harry. What...?

1313
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,943
What time is it?

1314
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,321
That was a...
I think that was Webb's idea to...

1315
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,323
- That he naps up there.
- I love that idea.

1316
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:12,867
It's...

1317
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,994
- He's a spider.
- It's such a cool thing...

1318
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,788
like when your script
starts to construct itself...

1319
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,456
and you have...

1320
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,251
such smart people
around you who...

1321
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,087
A director's so kind of focused
on transitions.

1322
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,218
- Yeah.
- That's always such an important thing.

1323
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,508
I'm always amazed
at how important transitions are.

1324
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,721
How necessary for flow
a really well thought out transition is.

1325
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,640
- Yeah.
- In the experience of the movie.

1326
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:39,212
Takes you by the hand,
makes you feel someone is in charge.

1327
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,312
That's right. That's right.

1328
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,815
Because Lord knows,
Jeff, you were not in charge.

1329
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,525
- No.
- No.

1330
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,944
You know what they say about Jeff:
A fabulous writer...

1331
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,613
- terrible transitions.
- Yeah.

1332
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,073
- Not in charge.
- No.

1333
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,452
Except maybe this.

1334
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,086
Spider-Man.

1335
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,339
What about him?

1336
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,009
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

1337
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:16,263
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

1338
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,142
but he can do everything else
a spider can...

1339
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,519
including self-heal.

1340
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,480
I need to find him.

1341
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,857
I need his blood.

1342
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,749
You need...

1343
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,002
Spider-Man's blood?

1344
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,633
It'll save my life.

1345
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,969
It may not, Har.

1346
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,554
It may not be that simple.

1347
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,566
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

1348
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,766
Connors was weak.

1349
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,310
This was another scene
that was reams longer...

1350
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,271
- than it ended up being.
- Yes, there was a lot of information.

1351
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,733
Not only was it this scene,
but there was a thread in the script...

1352
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:13,529
that started way back at the water,
not the High Line...

1353
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,909
about how,
after Richard disappeared...

1354
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,413
Norman had continued to spy
on Peter and Aunt May...

1355
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:23,914
thinking that perhaps...

1356
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,543
Because they hadn't found evidence
of Richard's death in the water.

1357
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,075
That maybe Richard would have
tried to reach out to Peter.

1358
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,631
And it sort of kept alive this idea
of the intrigue...

1359
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,135
of the Osborns and of Oscorp...

1360
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,886
which ultimately we found...

1361
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,178
and I think correctly,
wasn't really necessary...

1362
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,099
- ...to the telling of the story.
- Right.

1363
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,269
- What l...
- About how he gives people hope.

1364
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:48,731
Come on.

1365
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,537
What in the...?

1366
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,044
Just say yes.

1367
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,886
Don't turn your back on me!

1368
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,681
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

1369
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,809
Please.

1370
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,021
Peter, please.

1371
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,647
I can't.

1372
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:35,611
We did a bunch of different takes
of the final beat here...

1373
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,362
and in some of them...

1374
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,991
it was a menacing moment
that we had ended the scene on...

1375
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,826
where Harry was threatening him...

1376
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:46,288
and saying like, you know,
"Find him for me."

1377
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,332
And there was something off-putting
about it.

1378
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,223
You felt like it didn't motivate Peter...

1379
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,961
to do what he was about to do.

1380
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:56,048
And so we used this take
where he sort of reaches out to him.

1381
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,819
And once again, it's these two boys...

1382
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:00,052
just struggling to figure out
who they are.

1383
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,305
And that's what compelled Peter
to go...

1384
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,682
and at least try to help his friend.

1385
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,768
Hey! Miss Stacy!

1386
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,913
It also would have robbed, I think,
the elevator moment coming up...

1387
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:19,905
where you really get the first sense
that he's pretty menacing.

1388
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,783
It lands better by having him
not be menacing earlier.

1389
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,368
Yeah.

1390
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,080
Well, we wanted him to be torn
about whether or not to help Harry.

1391
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,290
- Not repelled by him.
- Definitely.

1392
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,085
It tracks better for Peter
that he's not freaked out by him...

1393
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,003
- ...in that way.
- Right.

1394
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,011
They're hiding in the Death Star.

1395
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,555
So this sequence...

1396
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,807
This is a great moment
between the two of them.

1397
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,418
- They're so great in this one.
- Such incredible chemistry.

1398
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,937
And then this next sequence
that we shot was a blast.

1399
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,107
It was... This was something
choreographed by Cal McCrystal.

1400
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,112
And we shot this sort of crazy,
you know, Buster Keaton...

1401
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,490
Andrew always refers to it
as sort of a Bugs Bunny moment.

1402
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,911
All in... You know, we shot it a bunch of
different times, but we did the master...

1403
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,665
and what you're about to see
happened in every take.

1404
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,918
It was incredibly intricate
to choreograph.

1405
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:21,216
And everybody in the scene
was part of Cal's sort of troop of...

1406
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:25,512
I don't wanna call them stunt men,
but sort of performers and acrobats.

1407
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,223
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

1408
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,267
Including... Not including Black Suit.

1409
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,769
No, no. He's...
He was somebody we cast.

1410
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,730
- He was somebody we cast.
- Yeah.

1411
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,916
This scene here, which I think
is among my favorite in the film...

1412
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,527
actually there was a moment...

1413
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,238
where it wasn't going to be
in the movie.

1414
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,449
- Oh, it was out of the movie.
- Yeah.

1415
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,159
Would have been very bad.
Bad choice.

1416
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,078
We were not willing to accept that.

1417
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,381
I think it was out
just as a matter of length and it's not...

1418
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,717
It's not literally necessary
to tell this story...

1419
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:07,638
but emotionally,
the two of them together...

1420
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,599
is the heart of the movie,
and without this scene...

1421
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,809
you really felt that loss.

1422
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,647
You end up falling into this trap
sometimes of cutting for plot...

1423
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:17,981
and cutting for length.

1424
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:23,028
And it's a process and, you know,
you lose things that may not...

1425
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,572
I mean, first of all,
there's real storytelling in here...

1426
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:29,534
but it may not have seemed
as though it was advancing the plot...

1427
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:34,456
but without it,
the movie loses a little bit of its soul.

1428
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,792
What you ultimately realize is...

1429
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:40,462
the real story of the real plot of the
film is the plot between the two of them.

1430
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,798
Yeah, and that's literally the...

1431
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,217
You know, the thing
that keeps the movie going is:

1432
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,636
How does Peter hold this
all together?

1433
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,447
How does he not lose this girl
and yet continue to be Spider-Man?

1434
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:53,850
So it's a critical scene in that way.

1435
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,938
And it's also the first time
that these two meet.

1436
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,065
Also in the elevator.

1437
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,859
- A lot of important moments happen...
- In the elevator.

1438
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,695
- ...in the elevator.
- Yeah.

1439
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,073
- Sometimes with a box.
- That's right.

1440
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,118
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

1441
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,453
I thought you two had broken up.

1442
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,667
Yeah. Yes, we had.

1443
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,460
And it's...

1444
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:22,587
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

1445
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,049
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

1446
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:27,968
He's got the most amazing eyes.

1447
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:31,179
I was just thinking,
it's a shame that there aren't enough...

1448
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:33,557
attractive people with good eyes
in this film.

1449
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,225
Exactly.

1450
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:41,023
They're always a little bit wet,
his eyes, as well.

1451
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,025
He's very vulnerable.

1452
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,944
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1453
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,405
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

1454
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,782
A scene like that is fun to write,
knowing where...

1455
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,118
- ...you're going with them.
- Yeah.

1456
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:07,174
When did Ravencroft first appear?

1457
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,301
- What comic?
- Venom.

1458
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,802
- It was first Venom?
- Yeah.

1459
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,930
- Ravencroft was really...
- I should know that.

1460
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,308
- ...an insane asylum.
- Yeah.

1461
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,813
And there were various versions of it
but this is...

1462
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,983
- Carnage was there for a while.
- Yup. Yup.

1463
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,363
And Venom ended up there.

1464
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:34,951
And there were other lunatics
but it was a high security...

1465
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,455
insane asylum.

1466
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,627
My father is not very familiar
with the comics...

1467
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,278
but my family is from Baltimore.

1468
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:48,256
He thought that was a shout-out
to the Baltimore Ravens.

1469
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,883
- He's wrong.
- Yeah.

1470
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,968
He couldn't be less...

1471
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,058
- Heartbroken when I pointed out...
- With love.

1472
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,458
- ...he was wrong.
- That's right.

1473
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,807
He was very disappointed.

1474
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,019
Yeah, and Kafka...

1475
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,510
- ...also was a...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1476
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,066
- That's a real shout-out.
- A shrink.

1477
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,654
There was a Kafka guy,
there was a Kafka girl.

1478
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:16,076
Kafka was actually a target
for Carnage.

1479
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,702
Yes.

1480
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:18,995
When he got out...

1481
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,249
one of the first things he wanted to do
was get Kafka.

1482
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,710
I liked the Kafka woman version.

1483
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:33,301
There was something more sinister,
you know.

1484
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,764
This was also another
remarkable performance from Jamie.

1485
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,894
The... Capturing the tone of this scene.

1486
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,772
Hundred percent.
Yeah, Marton Csokas is the actor.

1487
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,566
He's fantastic. And he...

1488
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:52,404
He really brought this character to life.
We had so much fun watching him.

1489
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,905
Like me.

1490
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,705
It's one of those moments where
you feel like you've won the lottery...

1491
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,999
when you get a call, as we did...

1492
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,668
saying that Hans Zimmer is a fan...

1493
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,838
and interested in doing Spider-Man
and, "Are you guys interested?"

1494
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,591
And it was like, "Are you kidding me?"

1495
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,635
He's the most brilliant composer and...

1496
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,763
His idea was to put together...

1497
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,932
this kind of dream team
of musicians.

1498
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,895
Johnny Marr and Pharrell obviously,
and...

1499
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,605
It became a...

1500
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,775
Sort of a combination of the classical
and the very contemporary...

1501
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,403
which I think, in some ways,
speaks to what the movie is.

1502
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:37,741
You know, it's this... It's this sort of
iconic classical beloved character...

1503
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,452
but who very much lives
in today's universe.

1504
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:47,626
And I think that's how Marc has always
envisioned his version of Spider-Man...

1505
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,544
as being very honest and very true...

1506
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,964
and very real and feeling
like the world that we live in today...

1507
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,884
not something from years
and years ago in the comics.

1508
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,011
And I think that's what Hans brought.

1509
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,598
And it wa... It's just...
It's very, very vibrant and bold.

1510
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:05,936
And, you know,
there's a sequence in Times Square...

1511
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:07,938
when you...

1512
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:12,567
Literally, the music takes you
inside the head of Max, of Electro.

1513
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,612
I've never heard anything like that.

1514
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,032
It was so personal
and it was so specific.

1515
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,992
And I just... I just think it...

1516
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,579
I feel like it's another character
in the movie honestly, the score.

1517
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,916
What are you doing?

1518
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:30,627
There were several versions
of this scene as well.

1519
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:35,715
And ultimately, what led to the scene
you're watching was Sally.

1520
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,593
- And her...
- Yeah.

1521
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:43,515
She sat down with you, Alex,
and said that the character...

1522
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,518
the heart of the character for her
was someone...

1523
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,855
who had dedicated her life
to really making this boy her boy.

1524
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:57,445
And that she had spent
so much of her life in service of him...

1525
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:01,700
and that him questioning her
about his parents...

1526
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,287
really struck at the heart
of her remorse.

1527
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,746
Yeah.

1528
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,793
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1529
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,804
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1530
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,756
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1531
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,009
- It's incredibly honest.
- Yes.

1532
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,720
It's like... She's right. She...
It's honest. She's right.

1533
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,722
It's like, "I raised you. I raised you."

1534
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:28,310
You're sitting here
pining after your heroic image...

1535
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,395
"of a father that was never here."

1536
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,441
And I get it.
It's incredibly, incredibly real.

1537
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,695
- She's an incredible artist.
- Yeah.

1538
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,071
Just incredible.

1539
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,951
At different times, this scene
was in and out of the movie...

1540
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:49,456
and in and out of the movie
in different sort of length.

1541
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,460
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1542
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,379
who was never here. No.

1543
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,090
No, I won't tell you.

1544
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,342
You're my boy.

1545
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,153
One of the great gifts of working
with actors who are talented...

1546
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,723
and who are sort of... Who just
wanna be inside the moment...

1547
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,016
as much as possible...

1548
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,727
was that Sally
did bring this really interesting...

1549
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,378
and unique perspective to the table
that felt very honest.

1550
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:14,856
And I think it made...

1551
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:20,445
It gave Aunt May more depth
than she's been allowed to have.

1552
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,489
And that's really cool.

1553
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,327
And as you say, Avi, this is something
that speaks to people in the audience...

1554
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,121
because it's true
to so many people's lives.

1555
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:35,001
Yeah. But the way she delivered it,
it's incredible.

1556
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,836
Yeah.

1557
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:42,175
And also, it spoke to this theme
of growing up, her saying to him:

1558
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:45,637
"I'm gonna tell you something now, you
need to hear it, it's going to hurt you."

1559
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,347
Yeah.

1560
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,559
They have a very special chemistry,
these two.

1561
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:52,936
All right.

1562
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,400
I'll tell you everything I know.

1563
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:04,989
And I think one of the things
that Marc brings to these films...

1564
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,783
is this emotional authenticity.

1565
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,618
For sure.

1566
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,036
He really fought for this.

1567
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,955
- Yes.
- He really did.

1568
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,170
They said the genetics research...

1569
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:22,882
that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1570
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:25,760
and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1571
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,012
And that's why he ran off with it.

1572
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,973
They said he was a traitor.

1573
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,975
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1574
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,145
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1575
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,855
for the money.

1576
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,232
I don't...

1577
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,097
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1578
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,949
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1579
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,451
It doesn't make any sense.

1580
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,910
Peter, I don't know.

1581
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,372
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1582
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,875
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1583
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,627
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1584
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:02,630
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1585
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,132
People were really...

1586
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,583
You know, they were curious
and a little bit frustrated.

1587
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,720
They wanted...
They wanted to know more.

1588
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,474
I mean, that was the impulse coming in
was, "What happened?"

1589
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,518
You know, you sort of set the table
for a mystery, but you didn't...

1590
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,103
You didn't solve it.

1591
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,231
So solving it
was a big part of what we...

1592
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,568
You know, there were a couple
of pieces that were left on the table.

1593
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,069
The promise that he made...

1594
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,781
the issue of what happened
to the parents.

1595
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:31,534
All that was stuff that we knew
right away we had to take on.

1596
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:35,705
Mr. Osborn.

1597
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,878
Look up.

1598
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:46,883
The tricky thing about the father story,
you know, to be honest, is it's past.

1599
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:48,374
You know, and so you want to...

1600
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,605
You want to resolve the mystery
but you also don't wanna get caught...

1601
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,224
in just telling back-story...

1602
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,310
and you have to keep moving
the story forward.

1603
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,022
So that part of the balancing act
was to make...

1604
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,191
what happened to Peter's parents...

1605
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:05,610
part of the forward-going story...

1606
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:10,031
and try to connect it
to where he was headed in the movie...

1607
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,243
and connect it to the choice,
the decisions that he makes...

1608
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,828
having to do with Gwen.

1609
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,955
To really play the consequences
of the story.

1610
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,415
Right.
Not just the discovery of things...

1611
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,335
that happened 20 years ago
or 10 years ago.

1612
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,921
Not right now.

1613
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,297
Excuse me?

1614
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,008
It's too dangerous.

1615
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,262
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1616
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,515
I'm already dying.

1617
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,269
Your blood can't make me die more.

1618
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,731
One of the tricky things in movies,
superhero movies...

1619
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:48,570
This is the question that my son
constantly asks... Is their voice.

1620
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,573
And would Harry recognize
his friend inside...?

1621
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,367
You know, his friend inside that suit
based on his voice.

1622
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:58,746
Should Peter be archly putting on
some other kind of tone...

1623
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:00,582
and I think the choice...

1624
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,667
- The only choice is...
- Like Batman.

1625
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,419
Is that you just have to accept it.

1626
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,795
- Batman.
- Yeah.

1627
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,298
- It's the Superman rule, you know.
- Yes.

1628
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,383
Yes, as soon as you put
the glasses on...

1629
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,260
- ...no one recognizes you.
- Yeah.

1630
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,511
It's the best.

1631
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,922
You're just gonna let me die.

1632
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,266
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1633
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,935
You're trying to protect yourself.

1634
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,732
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1635
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,183
- ...to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1636
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,576
I'm sorry.

1637
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,921
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1638
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,437
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1639
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:05,901
Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.

1640
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,607
They're both
very, very committed actors.

1641
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:09,817
So when you're doing a scene
that is tense...

1642
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,196
between characters where there's
a lot of conflict, they're breathing it.

1643
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,199
You know, there's a lot to that...
To that method...

1644
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,327
and so the day tends to take on...

1645
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:21,859
a little bit the energy
of the scene that you're doing.

1646
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,961
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do
with Harry.

1647
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,625
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1648
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,516
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1649
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,588
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1650
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,340
I don't know. I got no idea.

1651
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,844
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1652
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,765
I love this scene.

1653
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,226
Originally he had a whole sort of...

1654
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:46,187
He came clean with her and said,
"I love you." It was a whole thing.

1655
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,855
- Yep.
- And Matt...

1656
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,817
At some point in the process,
somebody...

1657
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,696
You said,
"What if he just doesn't say it?"

1658
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,572
And then what was great about that...

1659
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,825
- ...was...
- We got to hold it back for later.

1660
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:02,328
You hold it back, so he says it on the
bridge and then it's more meaningful.

1661
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,747
- It lets the air out of the balloon.
- Right, it does.

1662
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:07,359
- If you let him say it there.
- It does. It very much does.

1663
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,384
And this was
one of those really fun scenes...

1664
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,380
where what he has come to say...

1665
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,424
and the place
that he's found himself...

1666
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,884
- ...are in such conflict.
- That's right.

1667
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:21,973
It's so much about the cross purposes
of what he needs for his life right now...

1668
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,642
and then what he realizes
she needs for her life...

1669
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,973
- ...and not wanting to step on that.
- That's right.

1670
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,063
It becomes very funny and charming
and...

1671
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,732
Anyway, God save the queen.

1672
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,404
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1673
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,527
He did 30 different improvs...

1674
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,529
of that moment...

1675
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,614
all of which were great.

1676
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,270
- Of the Johns Hopkins bit?
- Yes.

1677
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:42,910
Yeah. Yeah.

1678
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,413
- "My fair lady, madam."
- I know.

1679
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,664
"God save the Queen."

1680
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,134
The thing that's also nice to see,
and heartbreaking on his side of it...

1681
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,344
is that he realizes that he can't...

1682
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,476
He desperately wants
to say this thing to her...

1683
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,308
but he can't stop her
from the thing she wants to do.

1684
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:08,728
And that puts him at odds with himself,
as Jeff was saying...

1685
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:12,273
in a way that makes you
kind of love him because he's...

1686
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,650
He's really making a choice
to sacrifice...

1687
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,542
what he wants to say
for her happiness.

1688
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:17,779
- Right.
- Even though...

1689
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,198
- ...it isn't gonna lead to her happiness.
- Yeah.

1690
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,367
And the two of them
are such unbelievable actors...

1691
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,870
that the looks,
the emotion they're just conveying...

1692
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,641
- ...looks between them...
- Priceless.

1693
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,083
- ...is phenomenal.
- Yeah.

1694
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,881
You realize in the process
in this moment here, the...

1695
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,425
There's a version of this scene
which was cut against...

1696
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:44,097
Which was much angrier and cut
against more angry, aggressive music.

1697
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,599
And played completely differently...

1698
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,050
and it really played against
what was happening here.

1699
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,733
Pietro Scalia, who's just a master,
recut this, put it to different music.

1700
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,424
And all of a sudden, the whole
entire feeling of the moment...

1701
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,571
in the sequence changed.

1702
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,217
This was a fun gag,
this Roosevelt gag...

1703
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,719
because it's true.

1704
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,805
There is actually that train.

1705
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:27,431
- There is.
- And...

1706
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:31,018
Probably right to send a shout-out
to our friend, David Koepp who...

1707
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,896
- That's correct.
- Years ago, we were working...

1708
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:38,442
on a remake of The Taking
of Pelham 123 with Tony Scott...

1709
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:42,488
and David wrote a scene
in the script...

1710
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,410
where he established
the Roosevelt spur...

1711
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:52,290
which was sort of this mysterious
dead-end spur that had been used...

1712
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,126
And as you're saying, Alex,
is a real place. That was used by...

1713
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,295
Or created by FDR...

1714
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,547
so that he could get
in and out of the train...

1715
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,425
beneath the Waldorf Hotel...

1716
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,343
without people seeing him struggle.

1717
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:10,141
And so it's this sort of mysterious piece
of New York lore...

1718
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,684
which is very, very real...

1719
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,228
and felt like the perfect setup
for a location...

1720
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,775
for Richard Parker's
sort of mysterious off-the-grid lab.

1721
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,945
Yeah, because you wanted it to be
somewhere hidden in plain view...

1722
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:24,822
but something
that nobody would find.

1723
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,575
- That's right.
- And you wanted Peter to be dri...

1724
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,786
Asking this question, driving towards
something he didn't understand.

1725
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:33,372
Then when it clicks in,
it clicks in hard and you get it.

1726
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:35,625
And that... Sort of finding that...

1727
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:39,378
and then being able to root it in reality
is even better.

1728
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,924
They had the venom extracted.

1729
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:46,719
What?

1730
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,431
What are you saying?

1731
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,562
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1732
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,603
but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1733
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,980
Where is it?

1734
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,149
It's somewhere in the building.

1735
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:05,196
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1736
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,033
Special Projects.

1737
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,701
Most recent entry:

1738
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,245
One hour ago.

1739
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,164
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1740
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,125
We based this on your desk.

1741
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,127
On the computer on your de... The...

1742
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:24,799
You have that computer prototype,
Matt, in your office.

1743
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,344
And so we thought we... It was so cool
that we would just use it for the film.

1744
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:31,138
Yeah, well, that is my office.

1745
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,141
File 71.

1746
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:36,602
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1747
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,022
The fun of this desk
and the opportunity of this desk...

1748
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,794
was to start building the idea
of all the different things...

1749
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:47,655
that were happening in Oscorp
and Special Projects...

1750
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,991
and lead to the revelation...

1751
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:53,828
that this universe is so much bigger
than just Spider-Man.

1752
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:58,374
So a lot of time was spent on
what the names of the files would be.

1753
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:02,295
You know, knowing full well that people
were gonna freeze-frame the image...

1754
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,546
and take a look at every one
of them, getting...

1755
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,883
And I think... I think in a subtle way,
even going back to that disk drive...

1756
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:11,721
the cube was the idea of Oscorp
has all the money...

1757
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,974
and all the most genius scientists
at their behest.

1758
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:17,145
- That's right.
- What would... Without really...

1759
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:20,313
In an Iron Man way,
without really making a story out of it...

1760
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,315
but just letting the set design
speak to:

1761
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:25,985
What would the coolest stuff you
could imagine look like and feel like?

1762
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,278
That's right.

1763
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,197
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1764
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,616
It's only a matter of time.

1765
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,536
You're going to die a horrible death.

1766
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,538
Like your father.

1767
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,749
The difference is...

1768
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,043
no one is going to miss you.

1769
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,920
Colm is great
in sort of his quiet intensity.

1770
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:46,589
Just a guy you're afraid of.

1771
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,926
He's such a...
Sort of a perfect corporate, cold...

1772
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,553
A-hole?

1773
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,140
I was gonna say "A-hole." I literally...

1774
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,601
I always use that word.

1775
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,938
The fun of this moment too is sort of
thinking from a story point of view...

1776
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,524
that this is the moment
where Harry Osborn...

1777
01:30:05,776 --> 01:30:07,485
who has everything,
loses everything.

1778
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,488
And so what does he have to do
to regain it?

1779
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:14,492
And one of the big questions
that I think we asked ourselves a lot...

1780
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,787
was how were we gonna make...

1781
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,331
the team-up of the two bad guys
feel very deliberate...

1782
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,793
and I think we had all felt
that there were...

1783
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,644
There had been movies made
in the past...

1784
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,640
that we had a bunch of bad guys
on screen and you're gonna go like:

1785
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:32,176
"I don't know why they're all together,
you know. It feels random."

1786
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,637
And I think
there's been a lot of criticism...

1787
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,348
of a lot of movies that have
done that. People feel like:

1788
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,141
"You're throwing everyone on screen."

1789
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:43,062
So we spent a lot of time talking
about what motivated them together.

1790
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,523
One of the things that got us so excited
was the idea...

1791
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,234
that really both Max and Harry...

1792
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,945
had been thrown away by Oscorp
in different ways...

1793
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:55,324
and both felt utterly betrayed
by Spider-Man.

1794
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,744
So strangely, there were two people
who had the exact same agendas...

1795
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:02,581
- Which also mirrors Peter and Harry...
- That's right.

1796
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,542
Who earlier speaking at the river...

1797
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,628
were talking about how they had
each been thrown away by their dads.

1798
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,256
But they came out on a much
different end of the equation.

1799
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:11,674
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Exactly right.

1800
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:15,469
Yeah, we kept talking about
that great quote in Capote, you know:

1801
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,440
"It's like we were born
in the same house...

1802
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,807
but I went out the front
and he went out the back."

1803
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:23,102
It was very much that sort of
dynamic between the two of them.

1804
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,564
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And every scene kind of reflected that.

1805
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:28,858
Marc had this amazing idea to...

1806
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,361
I don't think the actual train
is built like that...

1807
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,532
- ...under the track.
- There was no train there.

1808
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:38,284
- No, there is. The train... Yeah. Yeah.
- The train right here, there's nothing.

1809
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,816
Now there's a...
Then when you cut to it, there's a train.

1810
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,956
- Right. Right.
- That was all done by Imageworks.

1811
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:44,748
Yeah, yeah, but the... But the...

1812
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,294
The idea that the train
was hidden under the track...

1813
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:49,883
was this cool build Marc wanted.

1814
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,963
You know what?
To be honest with you, this was a...

1815
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,591
This was an idea that Webb had...

1816
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,009
- Yeah.
...for a long time.

1817
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,553
One of those things
that as a producer, you're sort of...

1818
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:59,044
You know, you walk that line...

1819
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,850
between wanting to fight
for your director's vision...

1820
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,394
and also sometimes not knowing
what the hell...

1821
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,396
he's talking about. And this was...

1822
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,400
This was honestly one of those
where it was like, "What?"

1823
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,611
"The train?" And it always felt...

1824
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:17,573
He got this kind of gli...
You know, glint in his eye...

1825
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:19,617
- ...when he talked about it.
- Yeah.

1826
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,827
And lo and behold...

1827
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:25,122
there's a kind of
magical realism to it...

1828
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,292
- Yes.
...that I think is really spectacular.

1829
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,960
And also, another thing...

1830
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:32,546
that you sort of haven't seen
in this universe...

1831
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,117
- ...know what I mean?
- For sure.

1832
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:37,301
And I really... I love that idea.

1833
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,136
And very definitely did not...

1834
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,514
Did not get it
when he first started talking about it.

1835
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,558
And it's interesting too,
because as screenwriters...

1836
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:47,209
the challenge of big sequences
like this where you have...

1837
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,230
This is a big, big...
Another big section...

1838
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,691
of all this exposition
and all of this back-story...

1839
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:55,783
and so there's two things
that you want to try and filter it through:

1840
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,531
One, you wanna try
and find a way to make it emotional.

1841
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,542
- First and foremost.
- First and foremost...

1842
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:03,244
is how do you make it emotional
so that it isn't just...

1843
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,162
a lot of science and gobbledygook.

1844
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,374
But then visually,
how do you drum-roll the reveal?

1845
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,084
- Or, you know...
- That's right.

1846
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,711
As we design the sequence,
you know, as an intercut...

1847
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:16,632
where you're paralleling Peter
and his revelation with Harry...

1848
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,425
heading toward where he's going...

1849
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:22,555
so that it felt like you were, you know,
really guiding the audience toward:

1850
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:25,140
"Okay, there's these two trains,
no pun intended...

1851
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:29,103
they're on colliding paths, and
they're about to hit each other and..."

1852
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,394
And these moments
are really speaking to each other.

1853
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,651
It's Peter finally understanding
the truth about his father.

1854
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,905
- Yes.
- While Harry's sort of descending.

1855
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:41,740
Yeah. And there was...

1856
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:43,909
a longer section we cut,
I think correctly...

1857
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:48,038
about the nature of the science...

1858
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:51,917
the nature of the virus
that Richard's fa...

1859
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,211
Richard had, you know, syn...

1860
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,880
Basically locked the blood work
to his DNA...

1861
01:33:57,132 --> 01:34:00,050
and that some of the tests
that he had done...

1862
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:02,303
enhanced the disease...

1863
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,680
the diseased cells
in people who had the disease.

1864
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:07,171
Also enhanced healthy cells
in people who were healthy...

1865
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:10,019
which explained one of them
was gonna become a goblin...

1866
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,229
and one of them
was gonna become Spider-Man.

1867
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,774
And it was just one of those things that
we didn't really need to tell the story.

1868
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,826
It was interesting because we went
back and forth and back and forth...

1869
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:23,240
about how much information
for plot's sake you needed...

1870
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,076
and what the scene
really needed to be about.

1871
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:28,412
What the scene needed to be about
for Peter Parker...

1872
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,383
was the revelation,
"My father loved me."

1873
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:32,384
- He wasn't a spy.
- That's right and that...

1874
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,251
That's what he was haunted by.

1875
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:38,380
There are smaller pieces of information
that are vital in terms of...

1876
01:34:38,632 --> 01:34:42,009
you know, what happened that day
in the lab and all of that.

1877
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,096
But really the big takeaway
that pushes Peter out the door...

1878
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:49,558
and to Gwen Stacy,
is that, "I was loved."

1879
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:50,809
Yes.

1880
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:55,147
And the story that I was telling myself
actually wasn't true.

1881
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,232
There's another piece of the puzzle
there...

1882
01:34:57,484 --> 01:35:00,861
which is, "My father
was at this particular crossroads..."

1883
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:04,573
and he made a choice,
and it ended up costing him his life.

1884
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,950
- And his son.
- And his son.

1885
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:08,842
If he could go back,
he would have made...

1886
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:10,759
"He says
he would make a different choice."

1887
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:13,874
And Peter is literally
at that same crossroads.

1888
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,794
And, you know, it is what propels him...

1889
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:20,673
toward Gwen as a result of not
wanting to repeat his father's mistakes.

1890
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:23,092
The great irony becoming
that the result ends up...

1891
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:24,510
- being the same.
- Yeah.

1892
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:27,241
Also one of the things I think
about the Spider-Man universe...

1893
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,474
that is very uniquely Spider-Man...

1894
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:34,436
is that it really does embrace
the tragedy of the circumstances...

1895
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:37,314
- ...of Peter's life.
- That's right. That's right.

1896
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:38,649
And by extension...

1897
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,527
how lost most teenagers feel
and how powerless.

1898
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,978
And how you realize it's the first time
in your life that the choices you make...

1899
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,034
- ...have real potential consequences.
- That's right.

1900
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,706
So this scene became... And one
of the late additions to this scene...

1901
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:56,500
when we were in rehearsals
with all the actors was...

1902
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,043
the "I need you" of it all.

1903
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:01,174
That was something that felt wonderful,
is that you had this character...

1904
01:36:01,423 --> 01:36:04,174
who, you know,
so desperately needed to be seen...

1905
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,469
and to be loved and to be cared for,
in Max Dillon. And you needed...

1906
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:10,806
You had a character in Harry who,
for the first time in his life...

1907
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:14,476
really needed somebody's help
and was begging for it.

1908
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:17,128
- And so it felt like...
- Was vulnerable enough to admit it.

1909
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,030
So you have these two...
These two bad guys...

1910
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:21,483
whose motivation is utterly relatable...

1911
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:25,404
but, you know,
ultimately super, super not good.

1912
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:28,139
I think for us, that tends
to make the best kind of villains.

1913
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:31,326
Yeah.
I love sort of the button to this scene.

1914
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:33,298
- "I had a friend once."
- "I had a friend."

1915
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:36,790
"It didn't work out." Like the elevator
scene where they're talking... Same.

1916
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,459
They're talking about Spider-Man...

1917
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:41,587
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max...

1918
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,380
and it's right at your fingertips.

1919
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,258
Other thing I love about Dane's look
as the movie progresses...

1920
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,552
is that he starts to look
more like a goblin...

1921
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,971
even before he gets... He gets sick.

1922
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:52,622
- He...
- Before he injects himself.

1923
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,644
This was a personal concern of mine.

1924
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:00,272
What would Electro be wearing?

1925
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:03,734
Right. This was... This was
a lot of topic of conversations.

1926
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:08,447
I mean, he... They probably wouldn't
put clothes on him in this scene.

1927
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:10,407
And yet, you know,
this is a PG-13 movie...

1928
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,118
and we don't need to see
more than we need to see.

1929
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,871
And yet when you have a full body shot
of him in the rig...

1930
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:19,792
and later when he comes out, we
had to have him clothed in something...

1931
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,044
so it became a question,
what would he be in?

1932
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,046
And so he...
On the day we were shooting...

1933
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,757
he was actually wearing
sort of like spandex...

1934
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,408
or Lycra, you know, bike shorts.

1935
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:32,679
And then I became obsessed
in the edit, like:

1936
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,807
Why would he be in bike shorts?

1937
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:38,352
And so the Imageworks guys...

1938
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:43,065
actually added a digital component
to the...

1939
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:44,900
To the... To the shorts...

1940
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:48,320
so that they looked like
they have a little bit of tech on them.

1941
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,739
- Right.
- So that you mind doesn't say:

1942
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,950
"He's this high-tech guy
wearing bike shorts"...

1943
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,743
which just seemed surreal to me.

1944
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,537
Well, of course, now my mind goes to:

1945
01:37:56,788 --> 01:37:58,914
What's the tech that's necessary
on his bike shorts?

1946
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,805
You can't. By the way, it's one of those:

1947
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,794
Don't go down that road
because there isn't any.

1948
01:38:04,045 --> 01:38:05,838
The alternative would have been
Watchmen...

1949
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:09,550
- ...where you have a giant blue...
- Right. Right. Right. That's right.

1950
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:12,593
- That was the alternative.
- That was the... Yeah.

1951
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,600
Giant blue what?
Where were you going with that?

1952
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,166
- Sorry.
- A giant blue electric...

1953
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:17,766
- Yeah.
- Tech.

1954
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:19,852
No!

1955
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:25,440
I love that in the background...

1956
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:28,151
- ...Kafka's just being lowered.
- That's right.

1957
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,571
And gets his comeuppance.

1958
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:34,324
- See the tech on the shorts?
- "I had a friend once."

1959
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Yeah. Me too.

1960
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,079
Then let's go catch a spider.

1961
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,874
And Marc also had
the very, I think, wise idea...

1962
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:46,044
to place that sort of battery reader
on Jamie's temple...

1963
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:50,007
to set up the fact
that he could be overloaded.

1964
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,760
It was tricky. It was like,
okay, you know, back building from...

1965
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,888
- That's right.
- All right, we have to...

1966
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,472
We have to overload a battery.

1967
01:38:57,724 --> 01:38:59,516
So how do we...?
How do we sell that idea...

1968
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:03,145
throughout the course of the movie
to give, you know, a credible death...

1969
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:04,676
to how they take out Electro?

1970
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,191
This was actually a scene
that we shot...

1971
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,403
after we had wrapped
and cut the movie...

1972
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:18,118
and decided we wanted Peter
to discover...

1973
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,129
Actually,
in the original cut of the movie...

1974
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,914
you actually saw Gwen go home...

1975
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:25,542
go to Peter's home looking for him
before she got in this cab...

1976
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,586
to say to him, "I'm leaving."

1977
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,087
And there she met Aunt May...

1978
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,299
and Aunt May said, "Peter's out
doing whatever Peter does."

1979
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:33,884
And it just... It felt...

1980
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:37,220
It was a lovely scene between the two
of them but it felt like shoe leather.

1981
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,706
- Then, of course, Peter...
- And we wanted to be on Peter...

1982
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,976
- Yes.
...and following him...

1983
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:45,312
as he came out of the subway.

1984
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,314
And again, coming out of the subway...

1985
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:50,609
feeling he had discovered something
new about the truth about his past...

1986
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:53,946
the first thing he wanted to do
was find out where Gwen is.

1987
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:57,032
He calls her and he finds out
she's already on her way out of town.

1988
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:02,162
It gave the movie a momentum
that we needed to go into the third act.

1989
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,248
Remember me?

1990
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,090
A lot of question too about
what Electro's outfit was going to be...

1991
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,176
once he fully...
Full tilt boogied into Electro.

1992
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:19,012
Because the outfit,
the green and yellow...

1993
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,264
was so iconic in the comic book.

1994
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,558
But I think everybody felt,
understandably...

1995
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:27,479
that it wasn't gonna translate
in the movie version.

1996
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,607
That being said, his cake
at the beginning of the movie...

1997
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:34,069
when you first meet him
are exactly the Electro colors.

1998
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,532
And so that was at least a tip of the hat
to the original design.

1999
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:40,743
- Right.
- It's one of the things that we spent...

2000
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:43,314
and will continue to spend
a long time talking about it.

2001
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,580
We all are doing this...

2002
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,834
because of how much we love
the comic books...

2003
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:53,130
and yet there's a certain license
that you feel that you need to take.

2004
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:56,425
We've already seen that story
literally told...

2005
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,511
and I don't think any of us
want to just retell exactly the story...

2006
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,043
that was told in the comic books,
put it on the screen.

2007
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:06,268
You have the books for that,
so we all spend a lot of time...

2008
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:09,938
and don't take lightly the fact
that when we make changes...

2009
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:13,108
when Harry becomes
the Green Goblin instead of Norman...

2010
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:14,860
we treat these things...

2011
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,446
We try to treat them
with as much reverence as they're due.

2012
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:19,156
No, you can't make those choices...

2013
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:22,117
without really thinking through
how it will pay off...

2014
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:23,994
in the rest of the movie...

2015
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,288
because they're sort of big
and they're bold...

2016
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:30,167
and people will either love you
or hate you for them very immediately.

2017
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:31,835
- And...
- Oftentimes both.

2018
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,886
- Right.
- By the way, I just wanna interject.

2019
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:38,091
There was a moment there where,
when we were shooting, Dane...

2020
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,635
- ...started doing the Jeopardy theme.
- Right.

2021
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,597
And then someone very quickly
pointed out...

2022
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,308
there's actually a real cost to that...

2023
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,351
and we would have to pay for it.

2024
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,520
And Marc said:

2025
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:53,053
"Okay, we won't do it.
We'll come up with something else."

2026
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:56,777
And then in good director form,
he had no intention...

2027
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:58,948
of doing something else
because he loved it...

2028
01:41:59,072 --> 01:42:01,406
and we ended up paying for it
with Jeopardy.

2029
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:02,824
And I'm glad we did but...

2030
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:04,576
But doesn't Sony own Jeopardy?

2031
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:08,830
Yeah, but it's still a company. It's still
a business. You have to pay. Yeah.

2032
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:11,166
It's funny. People forget that.

2033
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,543
It's like, you can't sing
"Happy Birthday" in a movie.

2034
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,155
- Right.
- Without having to pay...

2035
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,172
for the right to do it.

2036
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:24,262
Who...? Doesn't...? Paul McCartney
owns "Happy Birthday"?

2037
01:42:24,514 --> 01:42:27,349
No, it's two... It's... For a long time,
it was these two old ladies.

2038
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,101
- Yeah, I think it still is.
- Yeah.

2039
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,940
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

2040
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,029
Do it. Now.

2041
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,420
The prop design in this movie
is fairly remarkable.

2042
01:42:57,672 --> 01:43:01,508
- Yeah, it is.
- It all feels very organic and real.

2043
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,514
There was a whole sequence that
we ended up cutting out of the movie...

2044
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:10,183
again, for the momentum of it all...

2045
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:13,937
where the Goblin,
like, blew up the base...

2046
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:17,065
The base... First the basement,
and then the ground floor of Oscorp.

2047
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:19,985
And it was an awesome sequence.
It was super cool.

2048
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:23,780
And it was one of those things
that you have to measure out.

2049
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,791
There's so much happening
in the third act...

2050
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,553
and there's so much action in it...

2051
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:31,204
that at a certain point,
I think we all are sensitive to where...

2052
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,499
When does the audience begin
to turn off to too much happening?

2053
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,085
- That's right.
- And so we ended up cutting it...

2054
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:38,670
but it was a great sequence.

2055
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:41,047
There's a shot coming up here...

2056
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:44,843
It was actually the first appearance
of him on the glider.

2057
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,845
Right, as the Goblin, yeah.

2058
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:49,890
And the truth is, it slightly stepped on...

2059
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,183
More than slightly stepped on...

2060
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,144
- ...the reveal of him later.
- Yeah.

2061
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:57,939
And we felt very strongly
that you didn't wanna...

2062
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,317
You didn't wanna telegraph that.
You know what I mean?

2063
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,402
Even though you see it here...

2064
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,947
you don't quite know that
he becomes the Goblin on a glider...

2065
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:09,618
until that sort of tragic moment
later on...

2066
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:11,244
when he comes for Gwen.

2067
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:18,126
This was also one of those scenes
that had to be modulated a lot.

2068
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:21,296
When we first saw it,
it was really pretty horrific.

2069
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,131
- Yeah, it was.
- And terrifying...

2070
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:25,759
and beautiful the way Marc
had designed it.

2071
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:28,850
But it was, you know,
the stuff of nightmares.

2072
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:32,849
And so we had to dial it back to...
You know, and experiment with it.

2073
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,857
Stop the cab.

2074
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,151
Lady, I ain't even moving.

2075
01:44:44,236 --> 01:44:48,114
This always makes me sort of smile.

2076
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:53,119
Also makes me sort of annoyed.
The day we showed up to shoot this...

2077
01:44:53,371 --> 01:44:55,251
the bridge there,
right below "I love you"...

2078
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:58,708
all of that was shrouded in a tarp.

2079
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,378
- And it was, like, fantastic.
- What?

2080
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,421
They were doing
some kind of construction...

2081
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:08,093
and the whole thing was draped
in, like, some kind of a cloth.

2082
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:13,139
So we had to digitally remove it
at fairly significant expense.

2083
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:15,183
More expensive
than the Jeopardy theme?

2084
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:16,559
Much more.

2085
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:20,689
And for those familiar with The Night
Gwen Stacy Died comic book...

2086
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,774
she's wearing the exact outfit...

2087
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:25,568
which was leaked in a photograph
while we were shooting...

2088
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,154
and then thus began
an Internet fervor...

2089
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,407
about what was actually
gonna be her fate.

2090
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:32,993
And one of the things
that we talked about a lot...

2091
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:36,121
in the sort of construction
of this whole third act sequence...

2092
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:40,583
was playing with the audience
and setting up the expectation.

2093
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:42,210
She's gonna die on the bridge...

2094
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:45,588
because that's where she died
in the comics in that outfit.

2095
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,592
And then subverting that and thinking
she's gonna die again at another place.

2096
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,637
And then subverting that and then
finally doing it in the clock tower.

2097
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:57,017
We knew the minute she got out of the
car that day when we were shooting...

2098
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:59,519
- ...that that was gonna be...
- It was an emotional day.

2099
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,938
It was a very emotional day for Emma.

2100
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,190
For all of us,
but for her to put on that outfit...

2101
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:08,778
which, you know, signaled obviously
what was gonna happen in the story...

2102
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:12,949
but also the end of her run
in these movies...

2103
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,703
which was obviously, you know,
a big deal for her and for all of us.

2104
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:18,474
It was... It was very emotional, Jeff.

2105
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:20,749
And at the same time,
there was a certain degree...

2106
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,878
of feeling the weight
of the comic books...

2107
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:29,674
and of telling the story
and of trying to really tell it with the...

2108
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,677
- You know, the reverence it was due.
- That's right. That's right.

2109
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:39,893
We felt an enormous sort of debt
of gratitude and respect...

2110
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:43,104
for the books.
And also, you know, as Alex said...

2111
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:47,150
as soon as the first paparazzi,
paparatz...

2112
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,736
What's the singular version of...?

2113
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:51,693
Photographed her, it was...

2114
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:54,115
Cat was out of the bag.
We knew that was gonna happen.

2115
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:57,243
And this had been this secret
that we had held onto for years...

2116
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:59,370
since you guys started
writing the script.

2117
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:02,707
This was the day that, you know,
the rest of the world figured it out.

2118
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:05,502
Although I think a lot of people
also speculated...

2119
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:07,462
that we wouldn't go through with it.

2120
01:47:07,713 --> 01:47:09,353
That was a lot of the chatter
at the time.

2121
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,174
- Just...
- Alex was speaking to that.

2122
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:12,592
When things like that leak...

2123
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,969
there's always a bit
of that conspiracy theory...

2124
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:16,781
we let it leak on purpose so that...

2125
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:19,557
And also, you know, Sam...
Like Avi was saying earlier.

2126
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:21,059
You know, Raimi took it on...

2127
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:24,229
and decided to give it a happy ending
in movie one.

2128
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,398
And I think people just assumed,
you know, they'll never do it.

2129
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:30,652
I think people would have revolted
if we hadn't done it.

2130
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:34,072
It would have just felt like
a total cop-out on every level.

2131
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:36,783
- It just would've been dishonest.
- Yep.

2132
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:38,914
They're never gonna get this back up.

2133
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,755
How will I stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

2134
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,954
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

2135
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,876
There were days though on the set
where we looked at each other like:

2136
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:48,808
- "Really, are we gonna do this?"
- I know.

2137
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:51,214
Are we really sure?"

2138
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:54,008
- Whose idea was that?
- I think every step of the way...

2139
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:56,845
we all expected somebody to step in,
say, "Stop this," right?

2140
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:59,096
- Right. Right.
- They're not gonna let us do this.

2141
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:02,475
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

2142
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,018
How do you hear?

2143
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,354
Approach, do you copy?

2144
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:07,772
Radio's working. It's not us.

2145
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:11,484
This is another sequence that
at one point we took out of the movie.

2146
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:14,737
The air... What was happening
with the airplanes.

2147
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:18,867
And I think we all felt
as soon as you saw it without...

2148
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:21,091
it felt like
we were missing something.

2149
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:23,872
And I think it specifically
spoke to...

2150
01:48:24,123 --> 01:48:27,417
sort of the scope of, you know,
what was at stake...

2151
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,669
- ...for the city and for Peter.
- Yep.

2152
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,165
That's something we always...

2153
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:34,799
In developing these movies,
we always talk about is...

2154
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,427
what's at stake here,
and, you know, how...

2155
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:42,557
When you have to balance the scales
of, you know, Peter's obligation...

2156
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:46,019
to protect the city versus his own...

2157
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:48,646
You know,
his own well-being or those...

2158
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:50,982
You know, those of his loved ones.

2159
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:56,863
He always... He's always in a sort of...
An impossible dilemma.

2160
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,408
And so we decided
to really raise the stakes here...

2161
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,537
and have so many different things
going wrong...

2162
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:06,228
that he had to put back together.

2163
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,419
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

2164
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,921
Shut the thing.

2165
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,048
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

2166
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,176
Peter!

2167
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:21,721
- Her blurting "Peter" is fantastic.
- You know, that was an accident.

2168
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,932
- Yeah.
- And she literally did it...

2169
01:49:24,183 --> 01:49:26,434
and did it by accident on the night.

2170
01:49:26,685 --> 01:49:28,645
And when she puts her hand
over her face as if...

2171
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,563
to sort of shut herself up...

2172
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:35,652
she actually did that as if to say,
"I can't believe I just said that."

2173
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:37,946
And it was one
of those happy accidents.

2174
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,717
- It's such an inspired moment.
- Yeah.

2175
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:43,368
A happy accident, but also speaks to
when you're really inside of something.

2176
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:47,622
- And it just becomes authentic.
- She was... She was Gwen Stacy.

2177
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:50,500
This also is a moment designed
by Marc visually.

2178
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,168
- He drew this.
- Yep.

2179
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:55,713
This was... Yeah. This was a picture he
had on his... On his editing room wall.

2180
01:49:56,131 --> 01:49:57,971
- From the beginning.
- Long before it existed.

2181
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,921
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

2182
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,652
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

2183
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,321
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

2184
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,826
Just... The process
of shooting in 3D this time...

2185
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,370
I mean, we didn't shoot the movie
in 3D.

2186
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,915
We...
You know, whereas last time, we had.

2187
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:32,834
And this time, we converted it.

2188
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:35,378
You know, the whole art of 3D...

2189
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,923
has evolved sort of exponentially
since we made the la...

2190
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:41,968
And by the last one,
I mean the first Amazing...

2191
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:44,053
where we shot with a 3D rig...

2192
01:50:44,305 --> 01:50:46,848
which, you know, kind of,
by definition, is not nimble.

2193
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:50,476
I mean, you're basically shooting
with two cameras. And it really limits...

2194
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:52,812
what you can do...

2195
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:56,107
and how fluidly you can move.

2196
01:50:56,358 --> 01:51:01,070
But at the time, conversion was not...
Was not a great option.

2197
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:04,073
The film just looked much better
when you shot it in 3D.

2198
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:08,745
By the time we set up for this one,
the world had changed...

2199
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,916
and conversion
had become every bit as good...

2200
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:13,724
and better in some ways
in terms of...

2201
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:15,710
what you could do after.

2202
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,837
And when we hired our DP,
Dan Mindel...

2203
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,632
Part of the reason
Marc fell in love with him...

2204
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:23,676
And I think, Alex,
you introduced them.

2205
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:25,261
Yeah.

2206
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,598
Was because of the sort of fluidity
of his camera moves...

2207
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:31,559
and his ability to capture scope.

2208
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:35,646
And Dan was in no way open...

2209
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:38,566
to shooting with 3D rigs.

2210
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:40,401
So it was an easy conversation.

2211
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:42,653
But I think... I think you feel...

2212
01:51:43,989 --> 01:51:48,076
The movie just feels bigger
and the 3D feels more alive...

2213
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:51,329
because of what we were able to do
with the camera.

2214
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:54,082
Dan...
I made a bunch of movies with Dan.

2215
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,417
And he is...
You know, he is as good as they get.

2216
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:57,668
And he...

2217
01:52:01,006 --> 01:52:05,093
He brings an incredible
sort of fluidity to it...

2218
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:08,012
and a balance
of camera movement...

2219
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:11,849
to sort of still... A lot of people
move the camera all over the place.

2220
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:13,781
- You cannot tell what's happening.
- Yeah.

2221
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:18,731
And he always finds a way to help
his directors choreograph scenes...

2222
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:22,276
so that the camera moves beautifully
but it's never distracting...

2223
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,655
and it gives you
a constant sense of energy.

2224
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:29,283
- And...
- But not just for energy's sake.

2225
01:52:29,618 --> 01:52:31,285
- No.
- It's sort of very authentic and...

2226
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:33,121
Yes, and scope. And he lights like...

2227
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:34,997
I mean, his lighting is just
from heaven.

2228
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,334
He's just an incredibly gifted DP.

2229
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,295
And there's always a bit of...

2230
01:52:43,215 --> 01:52:45,550
It's...
One of the things that's so impressive...

2231
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,635
about his cinematography, it's...

2232
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,179
It's not just the big sequences,
but just the moments...

2233
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:53,141
where people are talking quietly
in rooms.

2234
01:52:53,642 --> 01:52:55,977
There's always a bit of a halo
around them...

2235
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:59,355
and the frames themselves...

2236
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,149
- ...are so mesmerizing.
- Yeah.

2237
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,651
And it... Again, I think
it speaks to what Matt says...

2238
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:07,864
which is he gives you a real sense
of scope and depth to everything.

2239
01:53:08,115 --> 01:53:09,699
You know, nothing is ever flat.

2240
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:14,328
And we shot this movie
the same way we shot Star Trek.

2241
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:18,624
You know, it's a weird process
because you do the scenes...

2242
01:53:18,876 --> 01:53:21,169
choreograph them with actors,
move the camera around...

2243
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:24,220
the actors step out of the frame,
and then the camera moves again...

2244
01:53:24,465 --> 01:53:26,007
- Yeah.
...in the exact same...

2245
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:29,434
With the exact same move,
exact same timing...

2246
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:31,304
so that the 3D can be converted...

2247
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:34,682
with the information it needs from
both shots, and it's a whole process.

2248
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:38,394
But it is much better because moving
around those 3D rigs is so tough.

2249
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:40,438
- It's just... It's so limiting.
- Yeah.

2250
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:42,273
This, by the way...

2251
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,066
What you just saw...

2252
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:47,820
Peter and Gwen...

2253
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:51,282
Actually, this right here
and the moment preceding it...

2254
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,825
was something we picked up...

2255
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,494
We had shot the scene...

2256
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:57,246
but we sort of went back
and picked up a bit more of it...

2257
01:53:57,498 --> 01:53:59,373
because we wanted
to underscore the idea...

2258
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:02,835
that Peter knew...

2259
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:05,296
that the arrival of Gwen there...

2260
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:07,590
was a disaster.

2261
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:10,092
This was sort of the beginning
of his worst nightmare...

2262
01:54:10,344 --> 01:54:13,012
that, you know, having broken
the promise and all of that...

2263
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:18,267
now he had put Gwen, once again,
directly in harm's way.

2264
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,651
We felt we needed
to hit that harder.

2265
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:26,400
And also hit harder her...

2266
01:54:26,652 --> 01:54:27,777
- Choice.
- Yeah.

2267
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,237
The idea that she was...

2268
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:31,808
She was very, very clear that
this... This isn't your call.

2269
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:35,284
This is my call. I'm here
because I make my own choices.

2270
01:54:35,536 --> 01:54:38,454
And so we went and shot...

2271
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:41,290
that little piece at the end.

2272
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,671
So all these little choices
that add up to her death...

2273
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:48,965
in a way
that sort of the math is right of it.

2274
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,056
- Yeah.
- And that's what's so hard about it...

2275
01:54:51,552 --> 01:54:54,053
is lining up the emotional math...

2276
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:55,763
so that the audience is primed...

2277
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:59,141
to deal and accept... Deal with
and accept something that is just...

2278
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,811
Everything in your body and heart
does not want to accept.

2279
01:55:02,062 --> 01:55:03,942
It's the first time
that Peter's Spidey sense...

2280
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:06,023
has sort of a psychic take to it
as well.

2281
01:55:06,275 --> 01:55:07,315
- He can...
- That's right.

2282
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:12,989
- Well... But you and I would know that.
- Correct.

2283
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,533
You know, it's like,
"Oh, no, you can't be here."

2284
01:55:15,784 --> 01:55:17,868
The universe just tells you
it's a bad choice.

2285
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,580
It's like when somebody throws you
a surprise party...

2286
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:23,958
and you realize you don't
wanna have all these people...

2287
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:26,002
in the same room at the same time.

2288
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:31,176
It's funny.
From the first draft of the script...

2289
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:33,759
through all the subsequent drafts,
this really did...

2290
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:37,305
- The structure really did remain.
- Yeah, it did. It absolutely did.

2291
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,807
Which was interesting that just the...
Sort of the...

2292
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:44,687
All these different... The intercutting
of all these different pieces of action...

2293
01:55:45,147 --> 01:55:47,867
all coming down to whether or not
Spider-Man was gonna defeat him.

2294
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:49,191
That's right.

2295
01:55:49,443 --> 01:55:53,404
And then the balance I think
of trying to figure out a way...

2296
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:55,656
that the audience
didn't necessarily feel like:

2297
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:57,366
"I just went through so much.

2298
01:55:57,618 --> 01:55:59,702
The movie's over now.
I can't wait for it to end."

2299
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:02,330
Because we still have
a Harry component to it...

2300
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:05,333
which is a more important piece of it.
So figuring out a way...

2301
01:56:07,336 --> 01:56:09,337
to take it just to the line hopefully...

2302
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:11,422
- ...where you still want more.
- Yeah.

2303
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,389
Yes!

2304
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,256
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

2305
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,852
I'll be back in a minute.

2306
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,647
Oh, thank God. All right!

2307
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,899
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

2308
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:33,653
There was a lot of debate about
how we were gonna...

2309
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:37,698
portray Aunt May in the third act,
in terms of what she was doing.

2310
01:56:37,949 --> 01:56:40,701
Remember how...? How, like,
the power outage had affected her?

2311
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:44,246
A lot of people commented on
how nice it was to see her...

2312
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,666
in a hospital doing something.

2313
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:49,210
You just hadn't seen May
doing anything like that before.

2314
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,753
That's right.

2315
01:56:55,509 --> 01:56:56,509
I love Oscorp Power.

2316
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,178
Such a smart idea.

2317
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,728
I think we can still make your flight.

2318
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,697
Gwen, stay there.

2319
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:22,868
This was something that Marc did...

2320
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,747
sort of in consort with Deb Scott
and with... And with people at Weta.

2321
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:31,836
Weta actually came in
and built the Goblin suit.

2322
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:33,921
And the idea was...

2323
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,633
you know,
for it to be completely tech...

2324
01:57:37,884 --> 01:57:38,884
you know, in that way.

2325
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:40,594
But also to serve...

2326
01:57:40,846 --> 01:57:43,639
You know, and sort of...
I think Alex referenced Electro's suit.

2327
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,141
That the suit...

2328
01:57:45,392 --> 01:57:48,561
had to actually have some logical,
you know, bearing in reality.

2329
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:51,981
We had a whole thing in the script,
remember? And you shot the scene.

2330
01:57:52,232 --> 01:57:54,358
- We shot it.
- The suit was designed...

2331
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,527
- ...to actually heal...
- Yeah.

2332
01:57:56,945 --> 01:57:59,155
- War field injury.
- Injur... Yeah.

2333
01:57:59,406 --> 01:58:00,990
And so it was...

2334
01:58:01,241 --> 01:58:03,576
- And then fly them out to safety.
- That's right.

2335
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:07,329
So while it was also, you know,
an awesome piece of armor...

2336
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:09,373
it served a function for somebody...

2337
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:12,793
who actually needed it
and empowered them, literally.

2338
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:16,505
Giving it a practical purpose,
it suddenly felt like it validated...

2339
01:58:16,757 --> 01:58:17,923
the whole idea of how...

2340
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,009
You know, we needed to ground it
in something.

2341
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:23,262
You know, before it was, you know,
Willem Dafoe in a mask...

2342
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,393
- ...which was a very different...
- That was...

2343
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,017
Some of the hurdle
is how to get around the mask.

2344
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:29,477
- Yeah, exactly.
- We wanted...

2345
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,353
You wanted to be able to see his face.

2346
01:58:31,605 --> 01:58:32,980
But we had this scene, actually...

2347
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:35,191
It was the scene in the midpoint
at Oscorp...

2348
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:38,778
when Peter goes to see Harry
and Harry tells him about his father.

2349
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:42,531
The scene originally opened with Peter
getting out of the elevator at Oscorp...

2350
01:58:42,783 --> 01:58:45,743
and the Man in the Suit
sort of walks past...

2351
01:58:45,994 --> 01:58:48,162
and they'd just been showing Harry...

2352
01:58:48,413 --> 01:58:52,041
Harry sort of boasts to Peter
about the tech of the suit. Right.

2353
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:54,418
Yeah, and he explained in that scene:

2354
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:57,004
"Oh, the suit is designed
for, you know...

2355
01:58:57,255 --> 01:59:00,925
If soldiers are injured in the field.
You know, it's a nano..."

2356
01:59:01,176 --> 01:59:04,053
I think we said... At one point,
said it was a nano-tech suit.

2357
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:05,864
- Yeah.
- We went away from that, but...

2358
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:09,975
And we liked this idea very much from
the beginning that science is neutral.

2359
01:59:10,727 --> 01:59:13,395
- And Oscorp had...
- Perverted it.

2360
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:15,087
...scientists like Richard Parker...

2361
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,670
It depends whose hands it falls into.

2362
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:19,235
...doing work that, you know,
was meant for good...

2363
01:59:19,486 --> 01:59:21,862
but ultimately could cause great evil.

2364
01:59:22,823 --> 01:59:24,824
- I love this shot.
- I do think that this is...

2365
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:28,244
The whole sequence
is just so spectacularly choreographed.

2366
01:59:28,495 --> 01:59:31,372
I think Marc did such an amazing job
putting this together...

2367
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,463
- ...you know, sort of...
- And Pietro as well.

2368
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:35,501
- Yeah. And Jerome.
- And...

2369
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:36,836
- God knows, Jerome.
- Yeah.

2370
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,510
Now, this was a tough day on set.

2371
01:59:45,345 --> 01:59:46,720
Because, well, my God, this was...

2372
01:59:46,972 --> 01:59:49,682
The emotional...
You just were walking on eggshells.

2373
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,642
We all were, because it was...

2374
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:54,061
Particularly the latter part of it.

2375
01:59:54,771 --> 01:59:57,731
So, Matt, speak to what of this
is set and what of this is digitally...

2376
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:00,442
Well, we had a physical set...

2377
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:04,446
which was, you know,
this interior of the clock tower...

2378
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:07,324
with enormous practical gears.

2379
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:10,714
Obviously there's limitations
in terms of what you can do with that.

2380
02:00:11,079 --> 02:00:14,415
So everything
was also digitally rendered.

2381
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:19,628
But what you're looking at,
you know, for instance...

2382
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:26,385
You're actually looking at her
dangling from a set on a wire.

2383
02:00:28,013 --> 02:00:29,413
So, you know, we had...
There was...

2384
02:00:29,598 --> 02:00:32,057
There was a practical one
and a digital version of it.

2385
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:36,061
- It was an extraordinary set.
- Yeah, it was an amazing set.

2386
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,439
One of the most beautiful sets
I've seen.

2387
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:41,191
This again, you know,
the hands of time...

2388
02:00:41,443 --> 02:00:43,235
and somebody was talking
about the...

2389
02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:45,404
And Avi referenced it earlier. It was...

2390
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:47,448
The moment that she dies...

2391
02:00:48,033 --> 02:00:49,533
was also the number of the...

2392
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,203
- Comic book.
- Of the comic book.

2393
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:56,624
And this was all Marc. You know,
Marc had choreographed all this.

2394
02:00:56,875 --> 02:01:00,169
It was an interesting process because
he did a great job of preplanning it...

2395
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,129
but then he really did rebuild it...

2396
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:03,881
several times in post.

2397
02:01:04,132 --> 02:01:06,800
And had all these really inspired ideas
for...

2398
02:01:07,052 --> 02:01:09,595
You know,
even from things like this idea...

2399
02:01:09,846 --> 02:01:12,127
that there was sort of like a hand
reaching in the web.

2400
02:01:12,349 --> 02:01:14,767
That was sort of a late addition to it
and...

2401
02:01:15,018 --> 02:01:17,227
He really spent so much
meticulous time...

2402
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:18,759
going through the sequence...

2403
02:01:18,939 --> 02:01:21,732
and paying attention
to the cause-effect of every little detail...

2404
02:01:21,983 --> 02:01:23,703
- ...which was so wonderful.
- That's right.

2405
02:01:24,861 --> 02:01:26,581
And this was a really tough thing
because...

2406
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:29,380
Well, this was... We really worked
over and over and over again...

2407
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:32,326
how to...
How to portray her fall and...

2408
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,995
We showed it...
We actually showed it to people...

2409
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:37,623
in a very early iteration of it...

2410
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:39,333
and it wasn't clear...

2411
02:01:40,377 --> 02:01:44,088
why she had died,
whether she had died.

2412
02:01:46,091 --> 02:01:47,891
- In the aftermath of...
- It's a fine line...

2413
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:52,012
because you don't want it to be
sort of a gruesome snap of the neck.

2414
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:54,098
In the aftermath of the comic
coming out...

2415
02:01:54,349 --> 02:01:57,101
there was actually debate as to
what had caused her back to snap.

2416
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:59,353
Well, there always has been.
There always has been.

2417
02:01:59,604 --> 02:02:00,479
Hey.

2418
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:05,943
We had to be clear
that in fact she was dead.

2419
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,570
Hey, Gwen.

2420
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,172
Hey.

2421
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,081
You're okay.

2422
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:21,083
Well, it also was the question of like...

2423
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,894
how brutal do you wanna go,
you know?

2424
02:02:23,128 --> 02:02:24,628
- Exactly right.
- Because it's...

2425
02:02:24,879 --> 02:02:27,589
- It could've been so much worse, but...
- That's right.

2426
02:02:27,841 --> 02:02:30,300
And the comic is pretty brutal,
you know.

2427
02:02:32,429 --> 02:02:33,929
But I don't think anybody wants that.

2428
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:37,808
And so figuring out
how to sort of do it...

2429
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:41,020
I think Marc measured it out
quite perfectly at the end of the day.

2430
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:44,565
Gwen!

2431
02:02:46,818 --> 02:02:49,862
And watching this
as many times as we did...

2432
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:53,240
Watching it for the first time
with an audience stunned me.

2433
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:56,160
- The power of the sequence and...
- Yeah.

2434
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:58,011
You know,
at the screening in New York...

2435
02:02:58,246 --> 02:03:00,664
the premier in New York,
people were screaming.

2436
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:01,999
- Gasping.
- Yeah.

2437
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:05,461
I mean, they literally couldn't believe
we had done this.

2438
02:03:05,712 --> 02:03:07,337
It's also worth noting that Andrew...

2439
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:10,424
is just the most...

2440
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:13,635
unbelievably dedicated...

2441
02:03:13,928 --> 02:03:16,305
He sent me a picture of himself
the day he was shooting it.

2442
02:03:16,556 --> 02:03:19,808
- Yeah.
- And the... With the text, "I hate you."

2443
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,894
- Because he was so...
- Yeah.

2444
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:25,397
- He was so wrecked from it.
- He fully lives it.

2445
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,528
But he lives it. I mean, that is
the great gift of working with Andrew...

2446
02:03:28,777 --> 02:03:29,777
is that he, like...

2447
02:03:30,028 --> 02:03:32,112
He just goes in heart and soul...

2448
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:36,658
and dives in there as deeply as
you would ever hope any actor would...

2449
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:39,369
- Yeah.
...and just invites you...

2450
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:41,288
to be a total collaborator.

2451
02:03:41,539 --> 02:03:43,457
And it's the...

2452
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:45,228
Again, like another just great gift...

2453
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,503
of these amazing actors...

2454
02:03:47,754 --> 02:03:51,799
is it becomes this kind of family
and a process...

2455
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:54,802
that we all share together
and build on together.

2456
02:04:09,776 --> 02:04:13,153
This was another interesting thing.
Marc had really designed this...

2457
02:04:13,404 --> 02:04:14,764
in his mind from the beginning.

2458
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:16,429
Really right from the first draft...

2459
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:18,298
he kind of knew
how he wanted to cut...

2460
02:04:18,535 --> 02:04:20,244
- Seasons.
the seasons.

2461
02:04:20,495 --> 02:04:23,205
And he had a really...

2462
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:25,816
It was another...
A bit like you described with the train...

2463
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:28,585
where he was so specific about it
and...

2464
02:04:28,837 --> 02:04:32,840
I couldn't... I couldn't quite tell if it was,
like, the most inspired idea ever...

2465
02:04:33,091 --> 02:04:37,594
or I don't know what,
but it turned out to be so...

2466
02:04:37,846 --> 02:04:39,012
- Beautiful.
...beautiful.

2467
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:41,140
- And kind of poetic...
- And in 3D...

2468
02:04:41,391 --> 02:04:43,711
- ...there's a depth and a scope.
- Oh, yeah, it's amazing.

2469
02:04:43,852 --> 02:04:45,435
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

2470
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,608
This was something we added too.

2471
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:53,500
- Matt, you wanna talk about this?
- Yeah.

2472
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:57,614
This was something we decided...

2473
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:00,868
You know, there was this... There's
this idea throughout the movie...

2474
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:08,167
that terrible things are coming
out of Oscorp.

2475
02:05:08,418 --> 02:05:11,044
And that Oscorp is the birthplace of...

2476
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:15,924
As I think Jeff said, of pure science...

2477
02:05:16,176 --> 02:05:17,634
but also a place where science...

2478
02:05:17,886 --> 02:05:19,887
- ...gets distorted and corrupted.
- Corrupted.

2479
02:05:20,138 --> 02:05:22,890
And originally,
we had shot the movie...

2480
02:05:23,141 --> 02:05:25,142
and cut the movie...

2481
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:27,144
and there was no...

2482
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:32,107
You never saw Harry again
after the scene in the clock tower.

2483
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,038
Some people wondered
whether he had died...

2484
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:36,597
- or whether he had gotten away.
- And it was sort of...

2485
02:05:36,696 --> 02:05:40,073
It was a loose end and it also felt like
a missed opportunity.

2486
02:05:40,325 --> 02:05:42,117
And, you know...

2487
02:05:42,368 --> 02:05:45,162
we haven't been shy about,
you know, the idea...

2488
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:49,750
that there are movies
like Sinister Six and Venom coming...

2489
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:53,170
and the idea that things
are gonna emerge from this place.

2490
02:05:53,421 --> 02:05:55,088
So if you look in the background
there...

2491
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:58,967
you see the Ock tentacles
and you see the Vulture's wings...

2492
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:02,971
and you see Rhino's rhino suit.

2493
02:06:03,932 --> 02:06:08,352
And it seemed like the perfect moment
to sort of set up the beginning...

2494
02:06:09,729 --> 02:06:11,521
Some sort of a team-up.

2495
02:06:12,023 --> 02:06:14,983
And so we decided
that we should go back to Harry...

2496
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:18,079
and put him
sort of at the center of it...

2497
02:06:19,948 --> 02:06:21,698
and the beginning
of something to come.

2498
02:06:22,742 --> 02:06:25,285
And so then this speaks to...

2499
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,621
We've talked about it earlier,
honoring her death...

2500
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:29,957
and then not wanting the movie
to end there.

2501
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:33,210
How do you move past that?
And one of the real consequences...

2502
02:06:33,461 --> 02:06:35,087
of Gwen dying...

2503
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:39,424
and then Peter reacting to it
is that the city has lost Spider-Man.

2504
02:06:39,676 --> 02:06:42,678
And it was very much a thread of
the first movie, was how does the mo...

2505
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,763
How does the city feel
about Spider-Man?

2506
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:48,684
And in the background, we've been
allowing the city in this film...

2507
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:52,771
to treat him much more as a hero,
and now he's gone.

2508
02:06:57,151 --> 02:06:58,860
You know, it's a tall order.

2509
02:06:59,112 --> 02:07:00,654
I think you pulled it off masterfully.

2510
02:07:00,905 --> 02:07:02,864
But it's a tall order
to ask an audience...

2511
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:06,785
to endure the death
of the most beloved character.

2512
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:09,246
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- And then 10 minutes later...

2513
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:11,039
walk out of the theater smiling.

2514
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:13,792
How do you do that math?

2515
02:07:14,043 --> 02:07:16,920
And the answer is Sally Field.

2516
02:07:17,171 --> 02:07:18,422
And this... It's true.

2517
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:21,466
And this...
And this incredible dialogue...

2518
02:07:21,718 --> 02:07:27,472
that speaks to
a kind of a universal experience...

2519
02:07:27,724 --> 02:07:30,142
we all...
That we all go through, which is loss...

2520
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:34,146
and how you get through it
and how you survive it...

2521
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:37,107
and where do you put that,
and where you put the people you lose.

2522
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:40,444
And I think it allowed the character...

2523
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,488
to go through this pain
and come out the other side.

2524
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:46,700
And it also allowed the audience
to transition...

2525
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:52,914
into what becomes sort of a big...

2526
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:55,417
almost fun scene
at the very end of the movie.

2527
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:59,338
There was a very interesting moment
for me personally. We did...

2528
02:07:59,589 --> 02:08:02,382
You know, as you do, we did
a test screening with an audience...

2529
02:08:02,633 --> 02:08:04,968
that had been invited to see the film
and they didn't...

2530
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:07,659
They had nothing at stake.
They had no investment in the film.

2531
02:08:07,889 --> 02:08:09,289
Afterwards, you ask them questions.

2532
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:12,726
And one of the questions was,
"To the moms in the crowd...

2533
02:08:12,977 --> 02:08:14,895
would you take your kids
to see this movie?"

2534
02:08:15,146 --> 02:08:16,229
It's an important question.

2535
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:18,190
And a woman raised her hand
and she said:

2536
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:19,881
"I would absolutely take my kids..."

2537
02:08:20,068 --> 02:08:22,486
because they are going to
lose people in their life...

2538
02:08:22,737 --> 02:08:27,657
"and I think this movie very honestly
dealt with the consequences of that."

2539
02:08:27,909 --> 02:08:30,744
- And it was really incredibly...
- Yeah, I remember.

2540
02:08:30,995 --> 02:08:32,275
- I remember.
- We had no choice.

2541
02:08:32,413 --> 02:08:35,999
I mean, if we didn't make it a movie
about that, then we would have...

2542
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:38,668
Then Gwen's death
would have been kind of for nothing.

2543
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,379
It wouldn't have had
any resonance.

2544
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:42,089
It just would've been a plot point.

2545
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:45,092
And I think at the end of the day,
really, what we...

2546
02:08:45,426 --> 02:08:50,180
What we wanted to achieve
was Peter to understand...

2547
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:54,142
that in order to pick up
the mantle again and be Spider-Man...

2548
02:08:54,394 --> 02:08:57,813
he had to accept that part of being
Spider-Man was about living with loss.

2549
02:08:58,064 --> 02:09:01,144
Living with the loss of his parents,
living with the loss of Gwen. But that...

2550
02:09:02,151 --> 02:09:03,985
As is the case for all of us...

2551
02:09:04,237 --> 02:09:06,917
even though they're gone,
you keep them with you in your heart...

2552
02:09:07,156 --> 02:09:08,949
and you fight on for them...

2553
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:11,410
- ...and that's what makes you a hero.
- That's right.

2554
02:09:11,661 --> 02:09:13,995
At the end of the day,
thank God we have Andrew Garfield...

2555
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:15,914
to convey all of that in this scene...

2556
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:17,624
because his performance...

2557
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:19,714
- ...in this piece is remarkable.
- You saw it.

2558
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:21,834
- It's amazing.
- Spectacular how he sort of goes...

2559
02:09:22,004 --> 02:09:23,764
- ...through all of that...
- Simultaneously.

2560
02:09:23,923 --> 02:09:25,257
- ...without saying a word.
- Yep.

2561
02:09:27,844 --> 02:09:30,303
Marc took me to this place
after we finished the movie...

2562
02:09:30,555 --> 02:09:33,306
and I didn't even realize that
it was the same one from the movie.

2563
02:09:33,558 --> 02:09:35,058
Yeah, it's right on the edge of SoHo.

2564
02:09:35,309 --> 02:09:36,476
Yes, exactly.

2565
02:09:36,727 --> 02:09:39,229
- And he loves it there.
- Yeah.

2566
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,571
Let's go! Move it.

2567
02:09:54,787 --> 02:09:56,538
It really is true that it's so tricky.

2568
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:58,709
You've got this movie
that's about sort of death.

2569
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:02,169
And then you've got a giant mechanical
rhinoceros running around New York.

2570
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:05,589
- How do you connect those dots?
- How do you get from one to the next?

2571
02:10:06,424 --> 02:10:09,593
Sally Field, Andrew Garfield.

2572
02:10:09,844 --> 02:10:13,472
And that's why it's an interesting
and very unique universe...

2573
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,266
the Spider-Man universe,
because all of those things...

2574
02:10:16,517 --> 02:10:19,853
- have to live in the same space.
- That was always Spider-Man.

2575
02:10:20,104 --> 02:10:21,229
Yup, always.

2576
02:10:21,481 --> 02:10:22,898
Incredible joy, incredible...

2577
02:10:23,858 --> 02:10:27,152
you know, larger-than-life
characters and action...

2578
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,904
and genuine human...

2579
02:10:29,155 --> 02:10:31,531
- Pathos.
...pathos and tragedy.

2580
02:10:31,782 --> 02:10:34,502
It's one of the things that you go back
and you look at the comics...

2581
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:38,288
and you forget how much time
was spent in the comic books...

2582
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:40,582
- ...when Peter was not in the suit.
- That's right.

2583
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,877
Just telling stories about this awkward
teenager dealing with growing up.

2584
02:10:44,128 --> 02:10:45,962
I think that's part
of what I loved so much...

2585
02:10:46,214 --> 02:10:49,508
about the first Amazing Spider-Man
was I was...

2586
02:10:49,884 --> 02:10:52,761
As much as I love Spider-Man,
because I always loved Spider-Man...

2587
02:10:53,012 --> 02:10:54,262
I was so compelled...

2588
02:10:54,514 --> 02:10:56,034
- ...by Peter and Gwen.
- That's right.

2589
02:10:56,265 --> 02:10:58,433
It was always more interesting to me,
that story...

2590
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:01,478
because it was so human
and wonderful and...

2591
02:11:01,729 --> 02:11:03,188
Look at this shot, you guys.

2592
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:06,274
I love... Not to interrupt you.
I just... I love this shot so much.

2593
02:11:06,526 --> 02:11:07,686
- Which one? This one?
- Yeah.

2594
02:11:07,818 --> 02:11:10,111
- Oh, yeah, it's amazing.
- One of my friends...

2595
02:11:10,363 --> 02:11:12,531
after seeing the film,
said we made a rom-com...

2596
02:11:12,782 --> 02:11:14,199
where the female lead dies...

2597
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,130
- Exactly.
...and you still go out smiling.

2598
02:11:16,369 --> 02:11:18,828
- Yeah. I just love this shot.
- It's amazing.

2599
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,000
I remember the first time
we saw it cut together.

2600
02:11:21,249 --> 02:11:22,457
Oh, yeah.

2601
02:11:24,752 --> 02:11:26,127
And the reveal.

2602
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:27,963
It was so brilliant.

2603
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:32,008
Hats off to Mr. Webb. Perfectly done.

2604
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:36,179
And to Andrew, who really fought
for this moment, from the beginning.

2605
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:37,681
I knew you'd come back.

2606
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:40,517
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

2607
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,852
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

2608
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:47,419
You're kind of speaking
to every kid in the audience with this.

2609
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:50,318
And, you know...
But this was the first movie, actually...

2610
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:52,696
that I could take my son to see
that I had made.

2611
02:11:52,947 --> 02:11:55,574
And he could not have connected to it
more.

2612
02:11:55,825 --> 02:11:59,869
And I think there's a big part of...
A big part of him that relates to that kid.

2613
02:12:00,121 --> 02:12:02,455
I think my son is sort of secretly...

2614
02:12:02,707 --> 02:12:05,333
curious as to why he wasn't that kid.

2615
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,127
He was there that day.

2616
02:12:07,378 --> 02:12:09,504
We shot it and Jackson was there.

2617
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:11,355
And he kept looking at me like,
"Really?"

2618
02:12:11,591 --> 02:12:13,091
- Yeah. "Who's this guy?"
- Right.

2619
02:12:15,052 --> 02:12:16,892
- "You want me to put on the suit now?"
- Yeah.

2620
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:18,256
- He was giving notes.
- Yeah.

2621
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:25,604
We shot this on Madison Avenue.

2622
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:28,732
- With a real rhinoceros.
- Yeah. No, that was all practical.

2623
02:12:28,983 --> 02:12:31,484
- Yeah.
- No.

2624
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:46,791
And this was something
that Marc had always envisioned...

2625
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:53,048
with the guys from Blur Studios
as being a tease for the Sinister Six.

2626
02:12:53,299 --> 02:12:54,466
Yep.

2627
02:12:54,717 --> 02:12:59,471
Embedded in the credits
was a sense of what was to come...

2628
02:12:59,722 --> 02:13:02,974
- ...which I think is brilliant.
- Yeah, it's very cool.

2629
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:10,857
Well, this was... I think
if there's one enormous challenge...

2630
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:14,402
that we faced
having already made the movie...

2631
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:17,155
it was the math of the ending...

2632
02:13:17,406 --> 02:13:22,327
and how to get Peter...
That's what we've been talking about.

2633
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:26,956
How to get Peter
from utter, you know, rock bottom...

2634
02:13:27,375 --> 02:13:29,417
having lost the love of his life...

2635
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:33,129
to a place where he can come back
and be Spider-Man.

2636
02:13:33,381 --> 02:13:35,256
Because we always knew
we were gonna...

2637
02:13:35,508 --> 02:13:39,177
We had to end this movie
with him putting the suit on again.

2638
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:42,028
It was... It would be devastating
and it wouldn't be Spider-Man...

2639
02:13:42,264 --> 02:13:44,184
it would send the wrong message
if he gave up.

2640
02:13:44,392 --> 02:13:46,976
So how do you restore faith?
How do you restore hope?

2641
02:13:47,228 --> 02:13:49,521
Who is...? And I remember
having conversations...

2642
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:51,815
with Jeff and Alex
in the very, very beginning.

2643
02:13:52,066 --> 02:13:57,362
What is the one thing
that could actually buoy him...

2644
02:13:57,613 --> 02:14:03,451
and give him some hope that life
is worth living after losing everything?

2645
02:14:03,703 --> 02:14:06,746
And it was one of those things where
it was like, literally, "What is it?"

2646
02:14:06,997 --> 02:14:08,456
Well, it would have to be...

2647
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:11,584
I mean, his father would literally
have to come back from the dead...

2648
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:14,254
or from wherever we thought he was.

2649
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:16,423
And the power of that...

2650
02:14:16,674 --> 02:14:18,717
was something
we all really fell in love with.

2651
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,800
That he'd be probably
the only person in his life...

2652
02:14:21,971 --> 02:14:23,596
who could pick him up
off the ground.

2653
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:27,058
And so they...
These guys wrote that scene.

2654
02:14:27,309 --> 02:14:29,436
And we shot it.

2655
02:14:29,687 --> 02:14:34,482
And it was one of the most spectacular
days I've ever been around on a set...

2656
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:38,528
in terms of the pure,
very raw intensity.

2657
02:14:38,779 --> 02:14:41,740
And I remember Andrew
and Campbell Scott...

2658
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:45,160
who obviously plays his father,
and who's a brilliant actor...

2659
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:47,495
did not rehearse the scene once.

2660
02:14:47,747 --> 02:14:49,664
They felt that...

2661
02:14:50,499 --> 02:14:51,671
And Andrew really felt this...

2662
02:14:51,751 --> 02:14:54,335
you know,
as embodying Peter Parker...

2663
02:14:54,587 --> 02:14:56,838
that he wanted...
He wanted in that moment...

2664
02:14:57,089 --> 02:15:00,008
When Richard Parker appears...

2665
02:15:00,259 --> 02:15:05,054
he wanted it to be something
he had never felt before...

2666
02:15:05,306 --> 02:15:08,516
as in real sort of Method acting
in its purest sense.

2667
02:15:08,768 --> 02:15:14,355
And so it was sort of a beautiful
snowy day in New York...

2668
02:15:14,607 --> 02:15:18,651
and we shot this scene where Peter
is standing over Gwen's grave...

2669
02:15:18,903 --> 02:15:21,223
and you've been through
the seasons, and it's snowing...

2670
02:15:21,363 --> 02:15:23,803
and all of a sudden,
he hears this voice behind him saying:

2671
02:15:24,033 --> 02:15:26,284
"Peter." And he turns and it's Richard.

2672
02:15:26,535 --> 02:15:28,828
And at first, he's incredulous.

2673
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:33,875
He can't fathom what...
That this could be real.

2674
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:37,337
And there's this incredible
sort of father-son moment...

2675
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:41,466
where Richard apologizes...

2676
02:15:41,717 --> 02:15:44,177
and Peter just screams at him,
you know:

2677
02:15:44,428 --> 02:15:46,721
"Where have you been?
Where have you been? Who are you?"

2678
02:15:46,972 --> 02:15:50,767
And finally,
Richard just embraces him...

2679
02:15:51,018 --> 02:15:53,645
and you see Peter sort of melt
into the arms of his father.

2680
02:15:53,896 --> 02:15:55,522
And then we transition to a scene...

2681
02:15:55,773 --> 02:15:57,690
of them walking to a bench
and sitting there.

2682
02:15:57,942 --> 02:16:00,276
And Richard describes to Peter...

2683
02:16:00,528 --> 02:16:04,280
that he can't fathom a world...

2684
02:16:04,532 --> 02:16:07,325
in which death
and the death of people like Gwen...

2685
02:16:07,576 --> 02:16:09,911
and the death of people
like his wife Mary...

2686
02:16:10,162 --> 02:16:11,830
where death is meaningless.

2687
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:16,876
And that, in fact, Peter is here
for some higher reason.

2688
02:16:17,127 --> 02:16:18,419
And that there must be a reason.

2689
02:16:18,671 --> 02:16:19,671
And that in fact...

2690
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:24,217
And he delivers the "with great power
comes great responsibility" line...

2691
02:16:24,468 --> 02:16:26,219
and it lands on Peter.

2692
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:30,431
And it was beautiful
and very, very impactful and powerful.

2693
02:16:31,183 --> 02:16:33,810
Also finally in that speech,
he said to Peter...

2694
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:36,145
that he had always thought
it was his legacy...

2695
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:38,481
- Yeah.
...to make the world a better place.

2696
02:16:38,732 --> 02:16:41,192
And then finally realized
that, no, it was Peter...

2697
02:16:41,443 --> 02:16:43,403
who had taken on this ability
of Spider-Man...

2698
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:46,531
and that now that he had it,
he couldn't turn his back on it...

2699
02:16:46,782 --> 02:16:50,577
which was really empowering,
but I think when the audience saw it...

2700
02:16:50,828 --> 02:16:54,330
they used the logic,
they voiced the logic of:

2701
02:16:54,582 --> 02:16:57,083
"Well, where was he?
How is he hiding for so long?"

2702
02:16:57,334 --> 02:17:00,879
And we had carefully set it up
throughout the movie.

2703
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:03,131
There was a moment on the plane
where Mary said...

2704
02:17:03,382 --> 02:17:05,758
to Richard, "At some point,
that boy is gonna need us."

2705
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:09,095
And you have to promise me
that we'll be there for him."

2706
02:17:09,346 --> 02:17:11,806
And the whole spy investigation...

2707
02:17:12,057 --> 02:17:15,059
had really tried
to subtly feather in this idea...

2708
02:17:15,311 --> 02:17:19,314
that Richard's body
had never been found, perhaps.

2709
02:17:19,565 --> 02:17:22,275
But the audience used the logic of
"well, where was he"...

2710
02:17:22,526 --> 02:17:23,943
to really cover the emotion of:

2711
02:17:24,194 --> 02:17:26,154
"How dare any father...

2712
02:17:26,405 --> 02:17:28,573
stay away from his son
for that long?"

2713
02:17:28,824 --> 02:17:32,535
People just on a visceral level
couldn't accept that.

2714
02:17:32,786 --> 02:17:35,306
And I think the other thing
that Alex very wisely pointed out...

2715
02:17:35,539 --> 02:17:38,958
was in a movie
that was about somebody growing up...

2716
02:17:39,209 --> 02:17:42,170
it also, in a way,
slightly infantilized Peter...

2717
02:17:42,421 --> 02:17:46,591
in that it took his father
to help him get over Gwen's death.

2718
02:17:46,842 --> 02:17:48,885
The movie finally really allows Peter...

2719
02:17:49,136 --> 02:17:51,638
to overcome his loss himself...

2720
02:17:51,889 --> 02:17:53,765
as opposed to needing the help
of a parent.

2721
02:17:54,016 --> 02:17:57,644
It's so tricky, because you're trying to...
You're trying to measure everything...

2722
02:17:57,895 --> 02:18:02,190
and balance everything against
what it means to have Gwen die.

2723
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:07,320
And when we started talking
about the story...

2724
02:18:07,571 --> 02:18:11,407
the first thought was, "Well,
the only thing," as Matt just said...

2725
02:18:11,659 --> 02:18:13,701
"you know,
that could get you to feel better...

2726
02:18:13,953 --> 02:18:16,704
would be that the death
begets a resurrection...

2727
02:18:16,956 --> 02:18:19,123
"so that he at least
gets his father back."

2728
02:18:19,375 --> 02:18:21,292
And that makes a lot of sense.

2729
02:18:21,543 --> 02:18:26,464
But the problem is that the audience
has already gone through the trauma...

2730
02:18:26,715 --> 02:18:29,634
of watching her die
and having to process that.

2731
02:18:29,885 --> 02:18:32,845
And in a weird way,
as much as we fought for it...

2732
02:18:33,097 --> 02:18:35,223
and fought for the ending
and shot the ending...

2733
02:18:35,474 --> 02:18:37,350
the first time I saw it...

2734
02:18:37,601 --> 02:18:39,769
my thought was,
"This is never going to work..."

2735
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:42,313
because
you can't ask the audience...

2736
02:18:42,564 --> 02:18:44,649
"to go through, in a weird way,
another trauma."

2737
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,484
- Yes.
- And then as Matt said...

2738
02:18:46,735 --> 02:18:49,821
the math of like, "Wait, so you weren't
there, why didn't you show up?"

2739
02:18:50,072 --> 02:18:52,472
One of those weird things
where you can't intellectualize it.

2740
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:54,367
- Like, you as a viewer, go:
- Yeah.

2741
02:18:54,618 --> 02:18:56,536
"I hate you for not showing up..."

2742
02:18:56,787 --> 02:18:59,187
and making your son suffer
through everything he suffered.

2743
02:18:59,415 --> 02:19:01,124
"It doesn't matter why. I don't care."

2744
02:19:01,375 --> 02:19:04,502
Like, there is a sort of
blinding just truth to:

2745
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:06,170
"You are the worst father ever."

2746
02:19:06,422 --> 02:19:09,424
And in fact, rather than being happy
about your return, I hate you.

2747
02:19:09,675 --> 02:19:10,925
"And I feel worse for Peter."

2748
02:19:11,176 --> 02:19:12,969
And we even tried to write to that a lot.

2749
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:16,180
In anticipation of that problem,
we had Richard say things like:

2750
02:19:16,432 --> 02:19:19,058
"I stayed away to keep you safe.
They were looking for me.

2751
02:19:19,309 --> 02:19:21,686
If I'd come back..."
None of it mattered.

2752
02:19:21,937 --> 02:19:24,439
And as much as he said that up front,
you...

2753
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:27,900
Andrew was right to yell and scream
at his father when he showed up...

2754
02:19:28,152 --> 02:19:31,237
because it's the only rational reaction
to a moment like that.

2755
02:19:31,488 --> 02:19:35,575
And so I think at the end of the day,
it really just sort of...

2756
02:19:35,826 --> 02:19:37,076
In looking at it, it was like:

2757
02:19:37,327 --> 02:19:39,829
"We have made a movie
about the death of Gwen Stacy."

2758
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:43,666
It needs to remain very simply a movie
about the death of Gwen Stacy.

2759
02:19:43,917 --> 02:19:45,877
And it needs to use the character...

2760
02:19:46,128 --> 02:19:48,755
who has really become his parent
in the movie...

2761
02:19:49,006 --> 02:19:50,526
"to deliver the message correctly."

2762
02:19:50,758 --> 02:19:51,966
And we entertained the, like:

2763
02:19:52,217 --> 02:19:53,497
"Does Gwen come back as a ghost?

2764
02:19:53,719 --> 02:19:55,219
Does his father come back
as a ghost?"

2765
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:57,638
- We talked about it.
- And Marc wisely said:

2766
02:19:57,890 --> 02:20:00,433
"That's bullshit.
Like, that's a lot of fakeness."

2767
02:20:00,684 --> 02:20:03,770
And we can't do that.
And that's, like, not a...

2768
02:20:04,021 --> 02:20:05,438
You know, that's not a real ending.

2769
02:20:05,689 --> 02:20:07,398
And it has to be...

2770
02:20:07,649 --> 02:20:10,610
"We have to watch Peter
pull himself out of the mud."

2771
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:11,861
He was totally right...

2772
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:15,656
and I think
an old screenwriting adage...

2773
02:20:15,908 --> 02:20:18,701
is that the simplest answer
is always the right one.

2774
02:20:18,952 --> 02:20:20,286
And I think it's true.

2775
02:20:20,537 --> 02:20:23,372
I think this just needed to follow
a much, much simpler line.

2776
02:20:23,624 --> 02:20:26,042
It was just too emotionally complicated.

2777
02:20:26,293 --> 02:20:30,713
Thanks for listening, and we put
a lot of love and care into this movie...

2778
02:20:30,964 --> 02:20:34,008
because we know how much people
love Spider-Man, love this universe...

2779
02:20:34,259 --> 02:20:36,299
and have been loving this character
for 50 years.

2780
02:20:36,512 --> 02:20:39,305
And hopefully,
the experience was a good one...

2781
02:20:39,556 --> 02:20:43,101
for everybody who came out and
saw it and who is watching this now.

2782
02:20:43,352 --> 02:20:44,872
I couldn't have said it better myself.

2783
02:20:45,104 --> 02:20:46,864
Thanks for listening and watching,
everybody.

2784
02:20:47,106 --> 02:20:48,397
Thank you, all.
