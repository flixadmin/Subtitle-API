1
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,775
So on the heels of the Cold War,

2
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,069
Barry Goldwater, a businessman

3
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,197
and a five-term United States Senator
from Arizona,

4
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,743
decided to run for the election
of the presidency.

5
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,244
He had a substantial impact and...

6
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,623
Are you excited for summer?

7
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,086
Yeah.

8
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,796
Are you gonna see your friends?

9
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,299
- No.
- Why not?

10
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,926
- Don't have any.
- So, you'll be with your brother?

11
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,636
Yeah.

12
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:49,558
Then, Milo, I think we've seen each other
enough that we trust each other, right?

13
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,768
Yeah.

14
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,520
You know you can answer honestly with me.

15
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,565
- Yeah.
- There are no consequences.

16
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,859
You understand
you don't get in trouble?

17
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,321
Yeah.

18
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,365
Have you been hurting any animals?

19
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,159
No.

20
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,203
Not at all? Not even thinking?

21
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,916
Maybe thinking, but... no.

22
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,918
So you're thinking about that?

23
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,754
Tell me about that.
Tell me about the thoughts.

24
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,881
It's nothing. Just thoughts now and then.

25
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,301
But I don't do it, not any more.

26
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,207
- Where you goin'?
- Get him!

27
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,016
- Come here.
- Fuck him up, D.

28
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,811
- Hold him.
- Hit him!

29
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,896
Stop it, retard.

30
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,569
That's nasty. You've got some on me, bro.

31
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,778
- That was fun.

32
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,448
That's right. You'd better run, little bitch.

33
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,614

Hey.

37
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,252
Did you buy milk?

38
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,632
No.

39
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,133
We need milk.

40
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,719
Did you pay the internet bill?

41
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,763
- No.
- I need the internet.

42
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,893
Then pay it. Get milk too.

What?

56
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,107
I'm gonna disappear for a few hours.

57
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,490
OK.

58
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,823
Hey, freak. Don't ignore me, motherfucker.

59
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,995
Yeah, it's time to go home, freak.

Yo, lock up your dogs. Woof, woof!

Ah, little weird-ass motherfucker!

All right, let's be out of here.

63
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,907
The elevator's broke.

64
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,533
Oh.

65
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,582
This way.

66
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,016
Hello?

67
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,527
Could, um... could you
help me with my bags?

68
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,381
Thanks so much.

69
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,092
- What floor?
- Nine.

70
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,433
- What's your name?
- Milo.

71
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,652
Holy shit. Thanks again.

72
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,033
Goodnight.

73
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,760
Let's go. Up you get.

74
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,553
Get off your ass. Get in there.

75
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,728
I think she loves me. Mm!

76
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,781
I thought I had a small one.

77
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,588
- Does that hurt?
- What the fuck?

78
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,800
Sorry. I saw you here earlier.

79
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,850
Yeah.

80
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,977
They're dicks.

81
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,943
You want a drink?

82
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,821
Sure.

83
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,118
I guess I asked a stupid question.

84
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,538
- What?
- Does it hurt?

85
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,498
Sex?

86
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,461
Not really.

87
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,254
No.

88
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,176
Oh, and...

89
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,219
You know what I mean, it's like...

90
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,806
It's like a release.

91
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,228
And, well, it's not like
I'm making my arm any uglier.

92
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,024
- What's that?
- Psoriasis.

93
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,986
It's not catchy or anything,
don't worry.

94
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,574
- Can you catch it from blood?
- What?

95
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,160
Like, can I get it from your blood?

96
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,204
No, no, no. It's not like that.

97
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,541
Can I see?

98
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,504
Can I see?

99
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,224
Oh, my God, gross.

100
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,643
- Sorry.
- Hey, um... I mean...

101
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,772
I mean kind of sweet... gross.

102
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,479
Wow, you're really into, erm...

103
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,440
Vampires.

104
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,233
I was gonna say scary movies.

105
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,235
No. Vampires.

106
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,533
Like <i>Twilight?</i>

107
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,369
Yeah. No.

108
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,913
I don't know.
I haven't watched them.

109
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,957
Oh, you should. They're really good.

110
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,389
Do you want to watch a video?

111
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:53,406
<i>The average American
consumes 120 pounds of beef per year.</i>

112

113
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,332
<i>will kill nearly three million cows

116
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,303
Erm... I have to go. I...

117
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,431
- I'm late for this thing, so...
- Yeah.

118
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,065
Sorry.

119
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,235
It's fine. I just... I just have to go.

120
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,282
What the fuck are you doing?

121
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,910
Nothing.

122
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,081
<i>- No! No!
- Let her go!</i>

123
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,125
<i>- Do it!</i>

124
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,885
<i>- Now look at her! Look at her!</i>

125
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,420
Hello?

126
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,634
Hello?

127
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,462
Milo!

128
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,217
Hey, Milo, wait up.

129
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,219
- Hi.
- Hi.

130
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,638
- Uh... Where are you going?
- Home.

131
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,557
- Walking?
- Yeah.

132
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,600
- Cool. Can I walk with you?
- Sure.

133
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,482
Do people ever tell you you don't talk a lot?

134
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,569
- No.
- Really?

135
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,529
No one ever speaks to me.

136
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,587
Sorry for showing you that video.

137
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:27,049
Don't worry about it. Um...
My friend Leo loves sick videos like that.

138
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,927
He used to show me
that kind of stuff all the time.

139
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,388
I mean, it's no big deal.
I just had to go.

140
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,265
No, it's... it's fine.

141
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,775
Do you ever think about suicide?

142
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,278
Not really. I can't kill myself.

143
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,782
- You can't kill yourself?
- Yeah. I can't.

144
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,869
Like, it's your religion?

145
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,248
I mean, yeah, sure. It's just the rules.

146
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,585
It's just the way it is.

147
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,545
My mom killed herself.

148
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,006
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

149
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,759
That's fine.
It's just something that happened.

150
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,640
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

151
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,707
Do you want to go to the movies
with me tomorrow?

152
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,294
Yeah, OK.

153
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,004
OK, cool.

154
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,801
What time?

155
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,720
Noon. I'll stop by your place.

156
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,842
- Hi.
- Hi.

157
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,761
Do you wanna...

158
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,208
Did you like it?

159
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,961
Uh... I thought it was interesting.
I liked the music.

160
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,172
But I still think <i>Twilight</i> is better.

161
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,967
You should see it or read it.
At least the first one.

162
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,095
I prefer <i>Let the Right One In.</i>

163
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,640
- What's that?
- Maybe I'll show it to you some night.

164
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,433
OK.

165
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,647
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't, like,

166
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,816
immediately asked me what I'm doing here.

167
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,776
Do you live with your parents?

168
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:18,030
No, my grandfather. He's pretty awful.

169
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,159
I mean, I guess the best thing about him
is that... that he's slow,

170
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,830
- so he can't catch me that often.
- Catch you?

171
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,666
Yeah. He's a violent motherfucker.

172
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,627
Put a cigarette out on me last week.

173
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,088
I almost went to the cops.

174
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,800
Wow. I guess you don't
like your grandpa much?

175
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,593
- Yeah, it's fucked up...

176
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,513
- Where's your dad?
- Dead. They're both dead.

177
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,309
- Oh. Mine, too.
- Really?

178
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,272
Yeah. My dad died when I was like, eight,

179
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,607
but he got sick when I was like, six.

180
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,279
I mean, it was...
It took a long time for him to die,

181
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,532
but when he did die, it was like,
a release, you know?

182
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,660
He was yelling and screaming all the time.

183
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,749
- Jesus.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

184
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:47,244
It's just, I bet the vampires in <i>Twilight</i>
aren't very realistic.

185
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,413
There's no such thing as a realistic vampire.

186
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,917
There is. I mean, more realistic.

187
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,795
I mean, vampires don't twinkle.

188
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,715
OK. So... So, what are vampires like?

189
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:04,178
Well, I think it starts
with drinking blood, like...

190
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,222
Like, you have a need to.

191
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,975
It's like... It's like when you have a cut
on your finger when you're a little kid,

192
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,103
and you're sucking it,
but eventually that's not good enough,

193
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,148
so you... so you switch to animals
and stuff like that,

194
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,651
and then, you know, people, and...

195
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,279
And you change a lot
after the first person you kill,

196
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,201
and you change a lot more after...
after one after another.

197
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:32,039
But I think when you first start off
being a vampire, all the...

198
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,667
all the stuff you see in the movies
doesn't really matter.

199
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,419
Like, you can go out in the sun
and you can eat garlic,

200
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,548
and I don't even think
the church stuff is even true.

201
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,591
Like, maybe to religious vampires,
you know?

202
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,052
And I don't think you get bit.

203
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,264
I think it's like a...
it's like a disease you get.

204
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,141
Wow. Which book is this?

205
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,479
It's not a book, it's just how I think it is.

206
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,065
Vampires existed before books did.

207
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,651
Well, the sun kills them in <i>True Blood.</i>

208
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,155
I did not watch that show. It did not look
like it was gonna be realistic at all.

209
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,032
Oh, my God, you should. It's so good.

210
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:12,204
In this one... erm, in this one episode,
the vampire that makes Eric

211
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,458
starts feeling, like, really bad
about what he does, so he kills himself.

212
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,129
He like, goes up on a roof,
I think, and then...

213
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,965
and then the sun comes up
and just kills him.

214
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,512
I mean, it could be true, but I don't think
a vampire can kill himself.

215
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,224
- Why not?
- I don't know. It's like a...

216
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,560
it's like an animal instinct.

217
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,147
So, they get to live forever?

218
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,691
Maybe. I don't know yet.

219
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,413
Do you go to their graves?

220
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,624
No.

221
00:31:56,624 --> 00:32:00,502
I don't go to my mom's grave.
I wouldn't even know where to go.

222
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,421
What do you mean?

223
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,091
My brother handled everything,
and he doesn't like to talk about it.

224
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,344
You didn't go to the funeral?

225
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,304
No. He said I shouldn't.

226
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,351
Well, then why not ask him?

227
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,271
I don't think that's a good idea. He...

228
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,316
He's weird about it.
He doesn't want to talk about her.

229
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,278
That's so fucked up.

230
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,076
Would you go if you knew where she was?

231
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,703
I guess.

232
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm gonna find her.
I mean, do you mind?

233
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,002
I guess not.

234
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:48,008
I'll go with you to yours and then
you can come with me to mine. Deal?

235
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,803
OK.

236
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,554
Cool.

237
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,689
Yo, freak.

238
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,944
No, no. That's not good enough, freak.
Come over here.

239
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,530
- Just keep walking.
- It's best if we go.

240
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,200
What's up? Who's your girlfriend?

241
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,743
My name's Sophie.

242
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,037
Hey, why are you slumming
over in the ghetto, Sophie?

243
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,123
Haven't you seen her?
She's living around here.

244
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,958
Yo, that ass? No fucking way, my nigga.

245
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,085
You all right, white bitch?

246
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,422
I'm sorry. I don't mean no offence.
I'm just playing.

247
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,216
- So why are you living here, white bitch?
- I live with my grandfather.

248
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,927
Is he that mean old white motherfucker
up on the ninth floor?

249
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,847
Can we go?

250
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,933
Of course you can go.
I ain't your fucking daddy.

251
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,061
Tell your brother I said hi, freak.

252
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,439
- Come on, man.
- Jungle fever fucker.

253
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,315
Come on, man.

254
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,949
They seemed nice.

255
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,577
They're in the K.
Some of them have killed people.

256
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,621
That was sarcasm.

257
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,751
I had fun tonight. I'm sorry about the...

258
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,172
Goodnight.

259
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,174
- Yeah.

260
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,601
- Milo, wake up.

261
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,187
- Wake up!

262
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,193
What?

263
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,945
There's some white girl
waitin' outside for you.

264
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,741
I found her.

265
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,523
So, what's your favourite vampire movie?

266
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,569
I guess the most realistic.
Like, I like <i>Martin</i> a lot.

267
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,073
It's a '70s one and it's... it's good.
It's... it's realistic.

268
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,618
And <i>Near Dark</i> is really good.
It's pretty cool and realistic.

269
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,412
And the one I was telling you about,
<i>Let the Right One In.</i>

270
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,499
I'm not sure how realistic it is.
I mean, like, she can climb on walls,

271
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,086
and I think maybe
they're just really good climbers.

272
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:33,715
And <i>Shadow of the Vampire</i> is...
It's good. It's pretty cool and realistic.

273
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,928
Do you miss her?

274
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,181
I guess I do.

275
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,433
It was about the making of <i>Nosferatu.</i>

276
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,188
I miss them.

277
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,494
I forgot to bring flowers.

278
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,539
What does it matter
whether you brought flowers or not?

279
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,457
She's not gonna know.

280
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,310
- You wanna talk?
- Not really.

281
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,045
Yo, it's that white girl again.
She's at the door.

282
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,089
Tell her I'm not home.

283
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,634
Really?

284
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,387
Yeah.

285
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,198
- I'll ask him.
- Yeah?

286
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,367
Yeah, I'll ask him now, now, now.

287
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,452
Hey. Hey, bro. Little brother.

288
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,996
Hey, kid.

289
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,706
Hey, what's up, man?

290
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,585
Yeah, uh, we were just wondering if
you knew where we could buy some C?

291
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,964
Yeah, please, or even some molly?

292
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,216
They don't sell it.

293
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,884
Uh... We're just wondering, uh,

294
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,595
you know, if you could help us out,
if you knew someone?

295
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,808
We're visiting from out of town
and we were hoping to party tonight.

296
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,145
- Uh...
- Yeah, I'll help you.

297
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,397
- Cool.
- Come on.

298
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,941
Yeah, awesome. All right. I'll be right back.

299
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:01,780
Hey, wait up.

300
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,537
Hey.

301
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,644
Oh, shit.

302
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,779
Come on.

303
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,046
Hello?

304
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,427
Hello?

305
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,308
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This is kinda fucked up.

306
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,606
- Hey, who's this?

307
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,152
Hey, what's up?

308
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,987
You guys must be them, right?

309
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,867
I'm, uh... I'm looking for some C,
or some molly if you've got it.

310
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,202
Wait. Hold up, what?

311
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,372
Uh... C. Cocaine? Or molly.

312
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,749
Oh, so you think everybody
that live up in here is a drug dealer?

313
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,710
No, no, dude. Uh... This kid sent me here.
I didn't think anything.

314
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,587
Why the fuck are you asking
for drugs, then?

315
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,757
- If you don't think that?
- Whoa, whoa, OK. Erm...

316
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,302
- Look, I'm sorry, uh... I don't...
- You don't think you're fucking racist?

317
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,179
Whoa, I'm not racist, OK?

318
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,557
Oh, that's exactly what we fucking need.

319
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,976
Fuck, are you a cop?

320
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,979
OK, this is just a misunderstanding,
I think. Yeah.

321
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:42,065
He said,
"This is a misunderstanding."

322
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,819
OK, I'm just gonna go now.
You guys are on the door.

323
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,029
Now shut the fuck up.

324
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,408
Little G, Little G.
What shall we do with this dude, huh?

325
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,368
- Let's fuck him up.
- Hey, you hear that?

326
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,704
- Dudes, come on. Look.
- Get him! Go ahead, get him!

327
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,289
- Whoa!
- Shit!

328
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,333
Whoa. What the fuck is wrong with you,
hitting a little kid, huh?

329
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,420
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Get that fucker.

330
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,217
Hitting little kids!

331
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,261
What the fuck do you think this is, huh?

332
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,930
Come up here talking about drugs,
then you go and swing on Little G.

333
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,683
Hey, man, stop crying. Come over here.

334
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
You wanna hang with us?

335
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,772
- Shoot this bitch.
- What?

336
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,525
- Chill.

337
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,402
- No!
- Shut up!

338
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,739
Are you gonna do it or not?

339
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,453
Wait. What are you doing?
Wait. Please, please.

340
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,746
Oh, shit, wait!

341
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,373
- What the fuck did you do?
- I didn't know he'd pull the trigger.

342
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,875
- Come on, man!
- I had the safety on!

343
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,085
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?

344
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,591
- Shit.
- Come on. Let's be out. Come on.

345
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,805
Hey! Hey, you, tell me where Mike is!

346
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,599
Stop! Hey!

347
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:58,535
<i>...told us to respond.
Do you want our unit to respond?</i>

348
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,874
We pass my road here.

349
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,502
- Hold on just a minute.
<i>- Ten-four.</i>

350
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,629
Oh, yeah. Right here looks good, right?

351
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,760
<i>The 7-2 is in backlog.
I got a 78 car over here.</i>

352
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,929
<i>Er, we're going into the 7-2.</i>

353
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:28,023
- Defending a snitch?
- Thanks, Milo. Stay safe.

354
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,482
Seriously.

355
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:40,118
<i>...you tell me,
"Ah, I'm buying a new car."</i>

356
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,536
Welcome home.

357
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,583
Where have you been last night?
This place has been crazy.

358
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,209
Yeah, I bet.

359
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,463
We were on TV.

360
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,756
We were?

361
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,758
Our building.

362
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,928
Someone killed
a white boy in the basement.

363
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,973
No shit?

364
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,852
Yeah. It's been crazy.
It's been on all the news channels.

365
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,569
Cool.

366
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,504
Why are you avoiding me?

367
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,964
I'm not avoiding you.

368
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,092
- Liar.
- I'm not a liar.

369
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,139
Well, liar, I got you this.

370
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:50,021
- It's <i>Twilight.</i>
- I see that.

371
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,818
Promise me you'll read it.

372
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,820
I promise.

373
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,505
Milo! What are you doing in here?

374
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,925
Come on, get out.

375
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,646
Are you gonna tell me what the fuck is going
on? I heard you talked to the police.

376
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,397
I didn't talk to them. They took me in.

377
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,733
Why did they give you a ride home,
if you ain't talked to them?

378
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:02,070
They said that if I didn't help them,
that they'd make it seem like I snitched.

379
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,782
Hey, they'll kill you
if they even think you talked to them.

380
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:08,117
- I didn't tell them anything.
- All right.

381
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,245
You know it don't matter what I think.

382
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,376
You saw it?

383
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,338
- Yeah.
- Shit.

384
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,634
Did they see you see it?

385
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,762
No.

386
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,932
I don't know.

387
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,773
Milo, I can't protect you from them,
you know that, right?

388
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,567
Lewis, stop.

389
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:45,071
OK. OK.

390
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,162
Lewis!

391
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,999
And don't trust your cops neither, all right?

392
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:58,167
They'll frame you for that shit
just cos they can.

393
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,128
OK, I get it.

394
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,131
Listen to your older brother.

395
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,884
All right. I understand.

396
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,178
All right.

397
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,234
So this is what you do? You sit up here?

398
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,030
Uh, I study.

399
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,073
That's cool.

400
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,163
Do you believe in God?

401
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,081
No. Do you?

402
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,044
I guess... Yeah.

403
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,464
I had a feeling that you didn't.

404
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,508
I mean like... I think we're all special.

405
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,970
I believe in that. I...I guess it's magical,

406
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,181
but I don't think
anyone intended anything in it.

407
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,434
I think when you die, you're just...
you're just gone.

408
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,020
Don't say that. It's so fucking creepy.

409
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,022
It's true. I think.

410
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,860
OK. OK, moving on. Erm...

411
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,741
What would you do with a million dollars?

412
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,160
What if I told you I had one million dollars?

413
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,038
- Then I'd steal it.
- You would?

414
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,873
No.

415
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,376
But I'd ask to borrow some.

416
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,878
What would you do with it?

417
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,341
Get out of here. You know, move out.

418
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:32,804
- Where would you go?
- Anywhere.

419
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:38,059
But I, erm... I have a cousin in Alabama.

420
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:42,063
She'd let me stay there. I could pitch in.
I'd probably go there.

421
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,733
Cool.

422
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,488
OK, so what would you do
with a million dollars?

423
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,241
I've got plans.

424
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,119
That's it?

425
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,246
Yeah. I've got plans.

426
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,624
I need any help you can give me.

427
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,169
I need three dollars
to have a place to sleep.

428
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,094
Thanks.

429
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,014
You're welcome.

430
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,560
Asher!

431
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,603
Bye.

432
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,163
Yo, Milo.

433
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,291
Been talking to 5-0?

434
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,293
- No.

435
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,170
That's not what we heard.

436
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,589
You heard wrong. I don't do that.

437
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,758
That kid screamed like a little bitch, right?

438
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,219
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on.

439
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,930
You don't think
he screamed like a little bitch?

440
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:27,186
It's a'ight, but Malik said
he saw you there. Right, Malik?

441
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,399
- I don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,693
Don't act fucking smart, OK?

443
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,736
I'm not.

444
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:40,533
Can I go?

445
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:47,957
This ain't over.

446
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,271
Do you want to do it again?

447
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,108
Stop!

448
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:20,198
<i>...defrosting or preheating that giant oven...</i>

449
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:25,077
<i>...better, healthier and easier...</i>

450
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,079
Um, so, I'll see you tomorrow, then?

451
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,748
Yeah.

452
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,378
Bye.

453
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,340
- Aah, I see you, bro.

454
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,717
Lewis.

455
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,680
What? That was nice.

456
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,141
<i>...oven is a new way to cook.
It's energy efficient...</i>

457
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,361
Lewis?

458
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,946
What?

459
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,989
What day is it?

460
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,116
Friday.

461
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,369
No, the date?

462
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,287
The 14th.

463
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,538
<i>Getting money
for injured people is a rare skill.</i>

464
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:54,166
<i>Insurance companies often refuse
to pay what is fair.</i>

465
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:59,380
<i>The lawyer you pick must be able
to make them pay, one way or another.</i>

466
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,590
<i>- I'm Lowell "The Hammer" Stanley.</i>
- Hey.

467
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,177
Hey. What's up?

468
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:08,597
Nothin'. Can I watch TV with you?

469
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,391
<i>Oh, good, good, good.</i>

470
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,853
<i>Come on! Make it work!</i>

471
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,819
The neighbours heard me screaming
and threatened to call the cops,

472
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,238
so he let me go.

473
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,367
Are you hurt?

474
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,121
No, I don't think I need
to see the doctor or anything.

475
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:36,250
I just really don't wanna go back there.

476
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,796
Is she OK?

477
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,631

I was, um... I was wondering if you had,

01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:49,688
There's nothing wrong with this cheque.

Are you...

- Yeah.

So... so we can trust
each other again.

620
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,967

638
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,817
It's for you to go to your cousin's.

639
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,654
Where did you get it?

640
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,994
Don't tell anyone you have it.
Just... just go.

641
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:24,542
Do you want to come with me?
I mean, you have to come with me.

642
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,127
- I can't.
- Why not?

643
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:28,963
You wouldn't like me in the end.

644
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,674
I'm not good. I never will be.

645
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,720
But I already know that you're crazy.

646
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:41,100
I'm not going.
Just... just make sure you go.

647
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,102
- Milo.

648
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:19,555
Go on, motherfucker!

649
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,016
- Drop it! Drop that fucking gun!

650
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,983
Women's history, in this regard,

651
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:36,197
tries to merge two approaches
that have been used in the past.

652
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:40,284
There's contribution history,
which views women as...

653
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:49,210
- Can I go?
- You know we can't end early.

654
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,546
Can I draw?

655
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,507
What would you draw?

656
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,676
I've been drawing the sun a lot lately.

657
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:03,724
<i>Hey, nice job cleaning the car.</i>

658
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,477
- Thank you.
<i>- So you heard, huh?</i>

659
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:07,978
No.

660
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,439
They arrested all of them.

661
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,026
Andre, Troy, Mar. All of them.

662
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:16,987
You mean all your old friends?

663
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,948
Yeah.

664
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,953
Don't remind me. You didn't know?

665
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:27,581
No. Why would I?

666
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,875
It's on the news, even.

667
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,086
They say they killed that white boy
in the basement

668
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:34,797
- and some white family in the Village.
- Really?

669
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,716
You didn't know?

670
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,678
- No.
- Yeah.

671
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,532
I just wanted to see if you'd left.

672
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,493
Call me.

673
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,365
Hey, freak.

674
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,432
Now you're not calling me?

675
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,685
Call me back.

676
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,728
Maybe come and meet me?

677
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:50,529

678
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,739

679
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,599

680

but arrange it.</i>

01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,698
<i>Like, if he could do something
and know that it would get him killed.</i>

682
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,037
