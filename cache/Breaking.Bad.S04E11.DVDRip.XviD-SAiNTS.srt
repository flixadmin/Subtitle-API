1
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,472
In here.

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,599
Hey!

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,360
Hey! Hey! What about him?

4
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,239
What about him?

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,278
Hey. Someone.

6
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,628
Help. Assistance.

7
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,593
This man needs help.

8
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,756
This man pays my salary.

9
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,951
Forty point two three pounds.

10
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,312
Are they back yet?

11
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,715
Have you heard from anyone?

12
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,436
If Pinkman is gone...

13
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,155
...I'm done. Do you understand?
I quit.

14
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,112
I just told you, 40.23 pounds.

15
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,952
Forty point two one.

16
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,838
My brother-in-law, he keeps talking
about driving out to the factory farm.

17
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,316
And I have- I have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

18
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,351
It's really at the point now...

19
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,472
...where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

20
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,752
So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,714
But I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

22
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,158
Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

23
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,634
Anything suspicious?

24
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,675
Still no, Walt.

25
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,076
Well, then should we go?

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,079
Got some place to be? Because it's,
like, the third time you asked me that.

27
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,114
No, I'm just curious
what the next move is.

28
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,357
Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

29
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,357
This here's the job, buddy.

30
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,473
Ain't all supermodels and speedboats,
you know.

31
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,912
Any cartel news these days?

32
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,557
Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

33
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,351
Yeah, well,
not a lot happening stateside.

34
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,552
Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

35
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,149
Lots of bodies, apparently.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,874
You know, even by cartel standards.

37
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,599
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

38
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,949
So when we gonna talk
about your face?

39
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,472
- I don't wanna get into it, okay?
- No, it's not okay.

40
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,558
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho...

41
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,990
...and he thinks
we're not gonna discuss it?

42
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,395
If you're in over your head
on something...

43
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,478
...don't you think I might be the guy
to come to?

44
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,637
You know, one of my old buddies
from Glynco had a gambling problem...

45
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,278
...except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack.

46
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,795
Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd
playing scratch-and-wins.

47
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,074
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

48
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,710
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

49
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,715
I'm just saying I'm here, you know.

50
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,037
If you want to talk about it.

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,316
I don't want to talk about it,
to you or to anyone else.

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,069
I'm done explaining myself.

53
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,959
Hey, you think he needs more blood?

54
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,032
It's in the refrigerator.

55
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,673
What, you- You want me to...?

56
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,716
A- negative, yes?

57
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,268
Your blood type?

58
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,116
I don't know, maybe.

59
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
A- negative, 25 years old...

60
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,830
...seventy kilo, 180 centimetres.

61
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,160
You smoke, you drink,
you puff, puff, puff.

62
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,075
But no disease, no condition.

63
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,037
No complication
other than an allergy to...

64
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,434
Oh, wait, don't say.

65
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,913
Erythromycin.

66
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,999
But I have cefazolin here,
so no problem.

67
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,074
How do you know all that?

68
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,632
Jesus.

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,035
He thought of everything.

70
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,631
O- negative.

71
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,319
That's what he needs.

72
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,117
It's time to go.

73
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,829
What about Mike?

74
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,949
With this injury? No travel.
At least a week.

75
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,958
I'll send for him.

76
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,118
You need protection, Gustavo?

77
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,956
I wouldn't have guessed.

78
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,350
Water and rest.

79
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,199
What happened to the plane?

80
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,591
There are many good ways south.

81
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,678
But, unfortunately, only one way north.

82
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,355
Six miles to Texas.

83
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,832
I've got a man there
who'll drive us the rest of the way.

84
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,309
I kind of liked the plane.

85
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,392
So you gonna make it?
Six miles is pretty far.

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,352
I'll make it.

87
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,798
You did well down here.

88
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,195
And you also proved a point.

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,436
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

90
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,198
Don't you?

91
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,830
Let Mr. White go.

92
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,392
Pay him off or fire him.

93
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,279
Don't kill him.

94
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,876
- You know that won't work.
- Then you got a problem.

95
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,233
Hi. We're home.

96
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,676
Are you doing your homework?

97
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,472
Yeah.

98
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,910
Well, dinner is in about 30.

99
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,111
Hey, sorry to call you at home...

100
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,278
...but I think maybe
you're not getting my messages.

101
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,711
That or you just
don't feel like talking to me.

102
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,396
Anyway, why I've been calling
is because that thing we discussed?

103
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,477
Well, I've been thinking...

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,435
...and I decided I can't do it. That's
probably not what you wanted to hear.

105
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,710
But hopefully you'll understand...

106
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,878
...and if you want to talk more about it,
that's fine.

107
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,196
So call me. I'm around.

108
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,194
- Hey. Come on in.
- Hi.

109
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,999
First, I wanna tell you that I get it.

110
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,433
From what you've told me, this situation
with Walt's gambling sounds...

111
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,757
...intense.

112
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,556
Yeah, it definitely was.

113
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,670
And continues to be.

114
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,911
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just help me out here.

115
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,157
Well, I've thought long and hard
about this...

116
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,591
...and here's what I want to do.

117
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,913
So is Walt gonna be okay?

118
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,712
Are you in contact with him?

119
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,719
He's fine.

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,275
Good. That's good.

121
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,512
- He doesn't know about you offering -
- No. Absolutely not.

122
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,315
And I mean to keep it that way, so...

123
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:01,153
Six hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars written out to me.

124
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,272
- What is this?
- I can't take your money.

125
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,799
- And why is that?
- Because, at the end of the day...

126
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,710
...paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings...

127
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,631
I don't know, it feels wrong.

128
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,554
"It feels wrong"?

129
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,432
To me it does.

130
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,758
I'm not judging you or Walt. I'm
just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

131
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,555
Well, Ted, the whole reason
we're in this mess...

132
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,558
...is because you had me
cooking your books.

133
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,311
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem for you?

134
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,875
Now, hold on,
that was a one-time measure...

135
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,469
...in an honest attempt
to protect my employees...

136
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,159
...and save my dad's company.

137
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,319
It might've been a big mistake, but
that's no reason to go out make another.

138
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,990
No, Ted, this is the big mistake,
right here.

139
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,718
You owe the federal government
$617,000. If you do not pay them...

140
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,230
...they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

141
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,230
And if they audit my business
find out that Walt and I paid for it...

142
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,194
...with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings...

143
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,712
...we will go to prison. Where you will
already be. Do you understand?

144
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,833
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

145
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,314
No one's going to prison.

146
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,875
Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

147
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,995
Okay, fine,
let's say I take your advice.

148
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,634
I pay the IRS. Then what?

149
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,035
Then you don't owe them.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,198
Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler.

151
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,029
I'm still going to go bankrupt
and lose my business and my home.

152
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,800
I still have to pull my girls
out of school.

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,596
Just because I pay some stupid fine
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

154
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,230
So if I'm understanding you
correctly...

155
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,797
...you're saying you can't take
the money I gave you...

156
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,428
...but you can take a larger amount.

157
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,200
No. I'm just saying...

158
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,392
...as much as I appreciate the gesture...

159
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,478
...the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

160
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,388
- Because it's not enough?
- No, no, don't twist my words.

161
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,991
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

162
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,197
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What? No. Blackmailing?

163
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,072
God.

164
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,031
- I feel I'm not explaining things right.
- I think you're explaining it fine.

165
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,437
I notice that this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

166
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,758
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

167
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,190
Now that you know,
you will be returning it.

168
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,472
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible...

169
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,035
...but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

170
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,674
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

171
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,750
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.
I want you to pay them.

172
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,552
Try it again.

173
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,195
Write a new cheque.

174
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,432
- Skyler.
- Same amount.

175
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,393
- This time, made payable -
- What happened to us?

176
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,388
Make it payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

177
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,679
- I can't.
- You have to.

178
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,158
- Actually, no I don't.
- Write it.

179
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,870
Saul Goodman, please.

180
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,469
Tell him it's important.

181
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,599
Yeah.

182
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,912
What have I done?

183
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,832
Hello, Hector.

184
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,836
All of them, Hector.

185
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,434
Don Eladio.

186
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,957
Don Paco. Cesar.

187
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,754
Renaldo. Artuno.

188
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,916
Cisco and Luis.

189
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,190
Escalada.

190
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,991
All dead.

191
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,880
As is your grandson, Joaquin.

192
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,711
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

193
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,831
Would you like to see?

194
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,349
This young man.

195
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,032
Do you remember him?

196
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,193
That young man
shot Joaquin to death.

197
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,353
While I made my escape.

198
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,710
I believe you have met him before.

199
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,871
It was just you and Joaquin.

200
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,039
He was the only family you had left.

201
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,958
Now the Salamanca name
dies with you.

202
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,430
Will you look at me now?

203
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,954
Look at me, Hector.

204
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,477
Look at me.

205
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,877
I really appreciate you doing this.

206
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,516
You guys must have your hands filled
with the car wash and all.

207
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,392
No, no. No worries.

208
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,712
Happy to do it.

209
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,115
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see how you work a case.

210
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,470
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

211
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,750
Like watching weeds grow.

212
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,314
This job can be boring as hell.

213
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,397
Until it's not.

214
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,917
So...

215
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,473
- Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
- No, same old, same old.

216
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,514
Bunch of animals
clawing each other's eyes out over turf.

217
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,755
So you think all the victims
were cartel members?

218
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,589
Not in the loop enough to know.
Take a right on this street, will you?

219
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,835
Right?

220
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,430
But we're going to the chicken farm,
that's straight ahead.

221
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,790
No, we're taking a little detour.

222
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,159
All right.

223
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,956
Yeah, there's this industrial laundry
I wanna check out.

224
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,038
It's not far.
Just, yeah, turn right here.

225
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,070
What-?
What laundry? What about it?

226
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,158
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

227
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,035
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

228
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,553
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

229
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,715
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

230
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,797
I mean, you said it yourself.

231
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,752
If this Madrigal, is it?

232
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,190
If this is such a big conglomerate...

233
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,439
...then, you know, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

234
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,717
No, it just -
It just sounds kind of thin.

235
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,151
Well, look at you. You lose your hair,
go on a couple stakeouts...

236
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,749
...all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak?

237
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,632
I'm just saying.

238
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,312
Now, the chicken farm, however,
boy, that place seems ripe...

239
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,990
...for some kind
of clandestine activities.

240
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,873
I just don't want us to miss anything,
you know?

241
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,355
You wanna talk
about clandestine activities?

242
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,074
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary...

243
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,193
...that manufactures this
state-of-the-art air filtration system.

244
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,992
And none other than Gale Boetticher
took delivery of one of these systems.

245
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,998
A chemist who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans...

246
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,910
...for a meth super-lab and was visited
by none other than Gus Fring...

247
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,793
...just days before he was capped
in the face, okay?

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,070
This shit is starting to feel like -

249
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,475
Like Three Days Of The Condor,
you know?

250
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,993
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be
one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.

251
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,873
There it is right up there.
Just turn in there.

252
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,836
Well, slow down.
You gotta turn in there, Walt.

253
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,349
- What are you doing? You missed it.
- Sorry.

254
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,269
It looked like a dirt road.
I thought you meant further up.

255
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,589
Just- Just bang a U-ie over here.

256
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,957
Hits the spot. Thanks, guys.

257
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,072
I said to Mom "ice cream,"
but she was like:

258
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,829
"It tastes the same and it's healthier."
So sorry.

259
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,314
I tried.

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,115
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
Tastes exactly the same.

261
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,470
I feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.

262
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,999
- Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, it's free food.

263
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,272
Free food always tastes good.
Free drinks even better.

264
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,833
Hey, hon.

265
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,399
Can you handle another visitor?

266
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,830
Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

267
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,838
- Don't run into any walls or anything.
- Okay.

268
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,109
Hey, Dad.

269
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,958
Hey, son.

270
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,037
So how you feeling, Hank?

271
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,913
It feels like one of those cones
they put on dogs...

272
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,636
- ...so they don't lick their own balls.
- Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

273
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
Anyway, hanging in there.
Glad you stopped by.

274
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,478
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.

275
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,114
I mean,
that guy just came out of nowhere.

276
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,117
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

277
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,038
I saw him coming a mile away.

278
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,234
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart...

279
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,512
...and be thankful no one got killed.

280
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,235
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

281
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,715
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

282
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,229
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

283
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,158
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

284
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,557
No, Marie's right.
It was a bit short-sighted of me.

285
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,638
- That's why I caved.
- Caved?

286
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,355
Yeah, I broke down.
I ordered me a gimp-mobile.

287
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,233
I wish you would stop calling it that.

288
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,233
What do you mean?
Like a handi-van with a lift?

289
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,479
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
It's got hand controls. I ordered it.

290
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,798
Should be here in about a week.
I don't expect to be in it long...

291
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,993
...but gotta get around on my own. Stop
being such a damn burden to everyone.

292
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,633
Sorry. Car wash business.

293
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,149
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

294
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,237
- I can listen.
- Fair enough.

295
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,671
He doesn't own a gun,
at least not one that he bought legally.

296
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,271
Nor does his home security system
have any panic button arrangement.

297
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,519
So way I see it, we're good to go.
If this is still how you want to handle it.

298
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,630
Like I said, I don't want anyone hurt.

299
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,832
All I want
is for him to write a cheque.

300
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,919
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on it.

301
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,158
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, thanks.

302
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,396
What-? You just can't -

303
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,038
- What's this about?
- I'll tell you what this is about.

304
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,471
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

305
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,714
- Huell? Who's Huell?
- This is Huell.

306
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,117
- Huell, you happy?
- Reasonably.

307
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,958
What would make you unhappy?

308
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,515
This motherfucker
not doing what he's told.

309
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,873
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

310
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,435
I'm gonna say no.

311
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,950
Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your chequebook. Ready?

312
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,436
Here we go. All right?
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

313
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,598
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

314
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,194
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $617,226 -

315
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,119
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Hold that thought.

316
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,279
Forgot to mention we know exactly how
much money is in your account, okay?

317
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,995
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

318
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,719
So $617,226 and 31 cents...

319
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,549
...made payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

320
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,873
What?

321
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,431
Wait, this is...?

322
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,354
- Skyler? Skyler White sent you?
- It doesn't matter.

323
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,790
For now, all you have to do
is worry about that.

324
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,797
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

325
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,468
Skyler is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

326
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,148
Let me call her. We'll...

327
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,751
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke. Phone call time is over.

328
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,838
- Cheque writing time.
- Skyler would never do this to me.

329
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,439
Sit down and write!

330
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,237
There you go.

331
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,358
Six hundred-seventeen thousand,
two-hundred-twenty-six dollars...

332
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,118
...and thirty-one...

333
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,197
Yeah, right.

334
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,478
You got it.

335
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,591
Huell, you happy?

336
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,277
Huell's happy.

337
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,268
All right. Everything else
has been filled out for you.

338
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,516
All's we need...

339
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,589
...is a signature...

340
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,074
...right there.

341
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,879
Great.

342
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,433
Hard part is over.

343
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,030
Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

344
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,596
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

345
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,870
Way back,
I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

346
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,072
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV...

347
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,192
...for the next couple
of days until the cheque clears.

348
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,958
Painless, right?

349
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,710
Unless you don't have cable...

350
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,714
...in which case it's gonna suck, so...

351
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,157
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

352
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,078
Nope.

353
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,672
Someone cooked here.

354
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,628
You've been out of commission
four days.

355
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,993
You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

356
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,760
Who cooked? Who was here?

357
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,834
I don't know how you're doing the flips.
Tell me.

358
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,189
Keep cool.

359
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,878
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

360
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,393
Jump.

361
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,439
You're pressing buttons,
and it makes you do magical stuff.

362
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,437
- No.
- Yes. Cheater.

363
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,358
- Hey.
- Who's winning?

364
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,279
- I am.
- Go on. Got you. Look at you.

365
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,835
- Look at -
- Yeah.

366
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,630
- A hundred and one back flips, I did.
- Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.

367
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,558
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Relax.

368
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,318
- You're in trouble.
- Good luck.

369
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,556
Mama is in the house.

370
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,198
Jesse.

371
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,839
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We need to talk.

372
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,988
I got nothing to say to you, man.

373
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,911
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

374
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,071
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

375
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,157
Get the hell out of my house.

376
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,793
Come on. Come on.

377
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,036
Hey. Just give me one minute.

378
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,800
Let me just explain. Okay. Okay.

379
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,274
Let me -

380
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,473
All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.

381
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,470
I know that you have been cooking
without me.

382
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,433
That's right. So what?

383
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,916
So what?

384
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,795
Isn't it obvious to you
what Gus is planning?

385
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,719
He's going to use you to replace me.

386
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,514
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

387
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,035
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree...

388
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,196
...to replace me...

389
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,068
...he will kill me.

390
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,390
You brought your brother-in-law to our
lab. What the hell is wrong with you?

391
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,558
- That's not my fault, Jesse.
- Get off.

392
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,919
You've got to help me. Please.

393
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,592
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

394
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,749
"I hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

395
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,759
You are done.

396
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,512
Fired.

397
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,795
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

398
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,835
Stay away from Pinkman.

399
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,999
Do not go near him.

400
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,032
Ever.

401
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,910
Are you listening to me?

402
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,675
Or else you'll do what?

403
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,512
What did you say?

404
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,234
Stay away from Pinkman...

405
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,910
...or else you'll do...

406
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,673
...what?

407
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,918
Kill me?

408
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,828
If you could kill me...

409
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,675
...I'd already be dead.

410
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,590
But you can't.

411
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,598
You can't kill me...

412
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,191
...because Jesse wouldn't cook for you
if you did.

413
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,916
That's it, isn't it?

414
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,473
No matter how hard you try...

415
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,716
...to turn him against me...

416
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,115
...to screw with his head...

417
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,153
...so that he would hate my guts...

418
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,870
...and he still won't let you do it.

419
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,398
For now.

420
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,434
But he'll come around.

421
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,237
In the meantime, there's the matter
of your brother-in-law.

422
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,272
He is a problem you promised
to resolve.

423
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,198
You have failed.

424
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,552
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

425
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,318
You can't -

426
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,114
If you try to interfere...

427
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,588
...this becomes
a much simpler matter.

428
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,075
I will kill your wife.

429
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,396
I will kill your son.

430
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,837
I will kill your infant daughter.

431
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,149
Great. Perfect. You know, this is just...

432
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,439
I told her you were my A-team.

433
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,437
It was an act of God.

434
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,871
Ain't no accounting
for no act of God.

435
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,877
Cheque is in the mail, at least.

436
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,639
"Hello, Mrs. White.

437
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,469
The good news is the IRS
has been paid off. The bad news is..."

438
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,558
Jesus!

439
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,679
Well, here goes nothing.

440
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,155
- Hey! Hey!
- Slow down.

441
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,679
- What the-?
- Saul.

442
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,952
- How did you hear?
- What? Hear what?

443
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,673
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.

444
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,269
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul. Saul.

445
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,198
This man that we spoke of before.

446
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,153
This person that you said
could disappear me.

447
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,713
- Give me a new life.
- Yeah.

448
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,797
- Make sure I'm never found.
- Yeah.

449
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,878
Yeah, I need him, Saul.

450
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,071
Gus is gonna murder
my whole family.

451
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,948
Christ.

452
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,674
I need this man now.

453
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,075
- Saul. Now, Saul!
- Yeah, yeah.

454
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,909
There's no coming back. You're gonna
get new Socials, new identities.

455
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,953
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

456
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,072
- All right. I understand.
- How are you gonna sell this...

457
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,670
- ...to that wife of yours and your son?
- I have got no choice.

458
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,792
You're wanted by scary individuals,
not to mention the law.

459
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,356
You're high-risk. You'll need
the deluxe service. It'll cost you.

460
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,709
How much?

461
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,673
Last quote I got on the deluxe
was 125 grand.

462
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,917
But you got four people.
It'll be at least half a million.

463
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,395
- He accepts cash only.
- I've got the money.

464
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,828
- Please!
- Here.

465
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,359
Okay.

466
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,754
This is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

467
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,270
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

468
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,311
You just call and leave a message.

469
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,512
You tell them
that you need a new dust filter...

470
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,553
...for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

471
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,149
I wrote it right on there.
He'll call you back.

472
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,158
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

473
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,237
The guy works fast. That's the game.

474
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,035
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

475
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,471
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

476
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,036
You gotta bring money. He doesn't
lift a finger unless he's paid.

477
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,514
Okay.

478
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,156
- Saul.
- Can't say it's been a pleasure -

479
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,555
I need you to do one more thing
for me.

480
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,239
You need you to call the DEA.

481
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,874
You need to tell them Gus
has a hit out on Hank.

482
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,833
- You have to do it for me.
- I gotta go on living here.

483
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,191
- I'm way too comfortable in my -
- Just call anonymously.

484
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,231
- You call anonymously!
- I can't!

485
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,192
I'm practically in the DEA family.

486
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,790
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

487
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,434
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do it for me.

488
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,835
- Please. Please.
- No.

489
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,316
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve
to die because of this.

490
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,750
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

491
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,076
- Okay.
- The most I'll go -

492
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,192
I'll say it's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

493
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,393
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to...

494
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,714
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

495
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,311
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

496
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,112
Yeah.

497
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,078
Thank you, Saul.

498
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,592
No, no, no.

499
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,154
Where's the rest?

500
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,472
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

501
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,274
- Walt?
- Down here!

502
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,675
Walt, what did that phone call mean?

503
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,958
Where is it?

504
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,712
Where's the rest?

505
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,949
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

506
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,670
Skyler, where is the money?!

507
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,555
I gave it to Ted.

508
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,113
What?

509
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,519
- You did what?
- Walt, I had to.

510
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,233
For us, for the family.

511
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,998
I swear, Walt -

512
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,430
You gave our money to Beneke?

513
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,668
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

514
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,393
Walt.

515
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,878
Walt.

516
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,269
Walt.

517
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,594
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

518
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,631
Skyler.

519
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,193
It's happening again.

520
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,678
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

521
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,230
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

522
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,151
Oh, God.

523
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,638
They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.

524
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,637
Oh, God.

525
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,638
When is this going to end?

526
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,236
Marie, I'm here.

527
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,953
I'm here.

528
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,799
Tell me exactly what happened.
