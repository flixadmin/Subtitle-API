1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:04,239
{\an8}<i>Ever since you began
to build your empire,</i>

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,359
{\an8}you've had a crutch to lean on.

3
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:09,399
<i>Mum, I swear
in the name of Almighty God,</i>

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,799
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,439
That, my friend, is the finest
opium in the world.

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,079
Perhaps we can meet
after you've spoken

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,919
<i>to your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.</i>

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,319
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,799
So speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,199
If he doesn'<i>t want to</i> buy
my opium,

11
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,239
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,999
It's Ruby. She's not well.

13
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,199
I'm coming home.

14
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,999
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,919
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

16
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,279
<i>You've been too busy</i>

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,359
<i>to punish the people
who killed her.</i>

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,159
<i>How is the family?</i>

19
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,639
Daddy!

20
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,399
Hello, Ruby.

21
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:06,879
Come here.

22
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,239
Let me see you.

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,679
I missed you.

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,999
I missed you.

25
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,839
There's the Black Madonna.

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,279
What presents did you get us,
Dad?

27
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,599
Son.

28
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,639
She's all better, Tommy.

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,599
You came back for nothing.

30
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,839
But I'm glad you're back.

31
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,799
Right,
before we do anything else,

32
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,279
we're going to go for a drive,
OK?

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,799
- Let's go.
- What about me?

34
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,319
Yeah, you can come too,
come on.

35
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,199
A drive where?

36
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,839
I've asked the driver
to take us to see Dr Robert.

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,679
I want him to have
a look at Ruby.

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,799
Why, love?

39
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,079
The appointment is in one hour.

40
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,599
You can stay here
or you can come.

41
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,679
Right.

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,399
Right, let's go.

43
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,359
Tommy?

44
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,919
Yeah?

45
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,679
It was all good.
Everything was clear.

46
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,279
That is a relief.

47
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,199
That's a relief.

48
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,239
Yeah.

49
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,119
Driver's bringing the car
round.

50
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,399
Daddy.

51
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,639
Hiya.

52
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,039
Come here.

53
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,079
When did you last sleep?

54
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,399
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

55
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,439
Well, now you know Ruby's
all clear, you can sleep.

56
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,799
Yeah.

57
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,559
Lizzie, I am very happy
that Ruby's results are clear.

58
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,319
But still you won'<i>t</i> sleep.

59
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,039
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

60
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,479
We could be on holiday.

61
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,959
We could be up a mountain
in America.

62
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,439
That wouldn'<i>t</i> have been
possible.

63
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,919
The man I'm dealing with
is coming to London.

64
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,199
I need to be there.

65
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
No escape.

66
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,759
We will escape, Lizzie.

67
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,679
One last deal to be done.

68
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,239
It'll be difficult.

69
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,759
Difficulties are to be
expected.

70
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,079
This is <i>why</i> I must move
from item to item.

71
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,439
Do you feel that?

72
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,919
Do you feel anything?

73
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,399
You know, you talk as if
you're watching everything

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,679
on a screen.

75
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,599
When we go home...
When we go home,

76
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,119
we'll give the kids to Frances,

77
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,279
and then you and me
will go to bed.

78
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,719
And I will be the next item.

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,759
That's how it feels now, Tommy.

80
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,919
Yeah.

81
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,559
Everything on a list.

82
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,879
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

83
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,199
Soon.

84
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,759
Tommy? Tommy!

85
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,519
Tommy? Tommy,
tell me what's happening!

86
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,679
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

87
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,119
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

88
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,719
Tommy, come here. Come here.

89
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,799
What's happening?

90
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,039
<i>Tommy!</i>

91
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:46,063
http://hiqve.com/

92
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,599
It is four years. <i>..</i>

93
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:07,479
<i>..</i> .One month and six days
since I had a drink.

94
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,799
My head is clear.

95
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,879
I am myself.

96
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,159
Is this the first time?

97
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,599
Once on the ship back.
Not as bad.

98
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,359
Tommy...

99
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,839
<i>...you</i> need to see a doctor.

100
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,199
I've work to do.

101
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,559
It's the work that's to blame.

102
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,359
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

103
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,639
We're going to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

104
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,199
Then we rest.

105
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,119
Then we Peaky Blinders
fucking rest.

106
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,839
<i>Comrades, before we end
this planning meeting</i>

107
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,319
and send you out
into the rain. <i>..</i>

108
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,039
...we have a surprise.

109
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,199
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

110
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,879
He came back early
and he has insisted

111
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,199
on addressing you volunteers
in person.

112
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,999
Comrades,

113
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,519
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

114
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,959
Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.

115
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,439
Silence, please!

116
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,559
I bring with me. <i>..</i>

117
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,519
<i>..</i> .On the train from London. <i>..</i>

118
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,199
<i>...a</i> message from Westminster.

119
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,279
No. No, no, no, not a message.

120
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,919
Not a message.

121
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,519
An instruction, in fact.

122
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,919
You must be silent.

123
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,359
You must say nothing.

124
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,039
Say nothing

125
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,399
about the present situation
in this <i>city.</i>

126
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,919
Say nothing about hunger.

127
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,999
Say nothing about jobs.

128
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,519
Say nothing about pay.

129
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,399
But those in greener pastures,

130
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,319
they may speak.

131
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,519
They may raise their voices.

132
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,639
But here in the smoke,
you men and women,

133
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,799
Irish and Italian

134
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,639
and English, who support
the socialist cause. <i>..</i>

135
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,319
And your socialist cats
and dogs and canaries.

136
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,519
<i>...you</i> must hush,

137
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,319
because the King
and all the King's horses

138
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,319
and all the King's men...

139
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,759
<i>...want</i> you to be silent.

140
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,999
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

141
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:06,159
the cuts in wages
and in welfare and in dignity!

142
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,639
And you must not complain,

143
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,319
because that would be
unpatriotic.

144
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,279
You soldiers
who have fought in France,

145
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,639
you are traitors
if you speak up.

146
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,719
You veterans of their wars

147
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,119
and their booms
and their busts,

148
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,439
it is you
who must take the blows,

149
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,159
and carry the burdens
for the sake of

150
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,079
those in greener pastures
who bellow at you. <i>..</i>

151
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,439
..."Silence! "

152
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,839
Well, watch this, comrades.

153
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,839
I will not be silent.

154
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,039
Never!

155
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,479
Not this Englishman.

156
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,239
No silence from me.

157
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,959
No silence from me,

158
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:53,039
because I have heard
your voices

159
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,639
when you come to me

160
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,079
and tell me about the cries
of your hungry children,

161
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,039
and I will gather up
every single one of those cries

162
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,439
and I will take 'em with me
on the train

163
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,039
back to Westminster. <i>..</i>

164
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,959
<i>..</i> .And I will let them
out of the bag

165
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,439
in the House of Commons,

166
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,719
and let them
<i>try to</i> silence that, eh?

167
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,479
Shouldn'<i>t that</i> involve
some sharing of the burden?

168
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,239
All of us taking a smaller
slice of the cake, eh?

169
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,079
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

170
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,599
and makes the cars
and melts the metal.

171
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,719
And the King, remember him?

172
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,439
The man who ordered
all of this.

173
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,599
Shouldn'<i>t</i> he be taking
some of the cuts?

174
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:54,439
Eh? Some of the blows?

175
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,559
Some of the pain? No or yes?

176
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,159
Yes!

177
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,519
Sh.

178
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,879
Hush, you working men
and women.

179
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,479
Silence.

180
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,679
Good.

181
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,719
Save your voices.

182
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,279
You're going to need 'em

183
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,679
on Saturday
when we rally together

184
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,759
at the Bull Ring Market. <i>..</i>

185
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,359
<i>..</i> .and together,

186
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,519
we'll raise the roof,

187
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,719
we'll break
the damned silence...

188
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,799
...and bring down
this broken government.

189
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,759
Tommy! Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy!

190
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,079
Thank you.

191
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,239
Laura McKee.

192
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:05,359
Battalion Commander,
Fermanagh IRA.

193
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,319
You missed the first
and second act.

194
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,999
Thank you for coming,
Mr Shelby.

195
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,279
Thank you. Thank you.

196
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,719
The third act was enough.

197
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,839
You both have reasons
to hate me

198
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,839
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing...

199
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,439
Sh!

200
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,799
Gypsy tradition.

201
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,639
We do not mention the name
of the dead in company.

202
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,359
Laura McKee,

203
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,959
in the Shelby family,

204
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,439
business comes
before issues of vengeance.

205
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,359
Our beloved departed
would understand and approve.

206
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:47,999
Let's go, boys.

207
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,239
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

208
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,599
No need for crowds.

209
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,639
We need you alive.

210
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,759
After you.

211
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,959
You know, Mr Shelby,

212
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,559
even though we've been doing
business for a while,

213
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,239
we've never met in person.

214
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,359
You spoke with passion. <i>..</i>

215
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,639
...and compassion.

216
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,159
You understand forgiveness

217
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,359
and you drink water.

218
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,999
Yet I heard
from many reliable sources

219
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:48,279
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

220
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,999
Moral turpitude. <i>..</i>

221
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,639
It's a good name
for a racehorse.

222
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,799
You don'<i>t</i> know what it means?

223
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,199
I know what it means.

224
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,359
It means you fuck people.

225
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,319
Fuck people over.
Don't give a fuck.

226
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,919
It means you covet and steal

227
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,039
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

228
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,159
Well, I'm changing,
Laura McKee,

229
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,359
and my organisation
is also changing.

230
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,959
So, what happened in Boston?

231
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,239
Jack Nelson said no.

232
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,199
Are we accepting no
as an answer?

233
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,479
These are letters. <i>..</i>

234
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,759
<i>...written to</i> and by
Jack Nelson

235
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,439
over the last three months.

236
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,719
This...

237
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,959
This is a private letter

238
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,239
from the President
of the United States.

239
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,879
Where the fuck
did you get this?

240
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,119
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

241
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,759
is just one of many
in my stables.

242
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,279
Sometimes, even now,
I'll take her out for a run

243
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,959
if there is a good cause
that requires her services.

244
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,439
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

245
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,679
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licences.

246
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,559
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

247
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,959
He's come to measure

248
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,479
the strength of support
for fascism in Britain.

249
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,039
He'll report back
to the President.

250
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,559
And how does that help us?

251
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,439
In this letter to his son,

252
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,959
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

253
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,519
In this letter
to a friend in Berlin,

254
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,959
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

255
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,559
He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

256
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,319
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

257
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,799
And you and I ...

258
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,239
...are going
to help him in that task.

259
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,239
I thought you were a socialist.

260
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,039
Well...

261
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,559
<i>..</i> .since I've entered politics,

262
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,759
I've learned that
the line doesn'<i>t</i> go out

263
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,159
from the middle to the left
and the right.

264
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,279
It goes in a circle.

265
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,799
I'll show you.

266
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,799
You go far enough left,

267
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,159
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

268
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,879
to get to the same place.

269
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,399
Working-class socialists
like me,

270
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,639
working-class nationalists
like you.

271
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,959
The result?

272
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,639
National Socialism.

273
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
And that's me...

274
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,119
...in the middle.

275
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,999
Just a man trying to make
an honest living

276
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,439
in a very dark world.

277
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,399
You have friends in Dublin,
Laura McKee,

278
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,399
who are actively fighting
for a fascist Ireland,

279
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,799
and you are acting
on their behalf, ain'<i>t</i> you?

280
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,119
When Jack Nelson
comes to London,

281
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:25,079
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

282
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,919
and to fascist sympathisers

283
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords,

284
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,839
on both sides of the divide.

285
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,159
Fascism is quite the thing. <i>..</i>

286
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,919
<i>..</i> .Among the very best people.

287
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,039
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

288
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,839
And you think this will allow
us to ship our merchandise

289
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,559
to Boston?

290
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,359
Perhaps.

291
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,319
There may be other benefits
for your cause.

292
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,799
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

293
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,959
and talk to him about
a new golden age,

294
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,679
and let him put a pin
in the map of Ireland

295
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,119
for the President
of the United States.

296
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,959
I came to collect Arthur
and put him to bed.

297
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,039
I found him in Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

298
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,719
A friend loves at all time.

299
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,879
A brother is born
for adversity.

300
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,279
Proverbs 17: 17.

301
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,079
I have <i>two</i> brothers in need,

302
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,879
but yours is the more urgent,
Tommy.

303
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,639
Will you come with me?

304
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,599
So, Laura McKee...

305
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,999
<i>..</i> .are you going to help me
change the world?

306
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:03,199
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

307
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,559
Never is.

308
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,679
Is that a yes or a no?

309
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,439
My answer's yes.

310
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,439
The answer's always yes.

311
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,679
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

312
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,879
And tell your friends
back home -

313
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:24,759
Tommy Shelby has changed.

314
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,719
Where is he?

315
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,599
When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

316
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,559
He's sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

317
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,039
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

318
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,479
It's all under control, Ada.

319
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,879
Well, <i>I'm</i> not under
fucking control!

320
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,199
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

321
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,159
Even though I'm trying to be.

322
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,519
She would have stopped this.

323
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,279
We will pull Arthur
through this.

324
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,759
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you!

325
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,679
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

326
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,319
Ada, this will be the end
of it, do you hear me?

327
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,879
This is the <i>way</i> out
for all of us,

328
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,519
and along the way,
I will be doing good.

329
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:04,639
No, along the way,

330
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,359
you're going to make yourself
a lot of fucking money.

331
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,999
All right, fair enough.

332
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,119
Any incidental rewards for
my good work will be welcome.

333
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,639
But you will get
your fair share, sister.

334
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,759
And by being
among the fascists,

335
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,359
by being among 'em,
I can undermine them.

336
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,839
Polly would approve.

337
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,719
Beneath all the gold
and diamonds

338
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,959
and fucking...fucking mink
and lace,

339
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,839
she was a solid socialist.

340
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:35,719
Look, I know it's too late
for this, Tom, but. <i>..</i>

341
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,559
This doorway.

342
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,439
This same fucking doorway.

343
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,599
We used to come here
for Dad's beer.

344
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:48,159
And we were so little, it took
<i>two</i> of us carry one bucket.

345
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,239
Yeah, I remember.

346
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,999
Look at us now, eh?

347
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,119
Yeah. Fucking look at us.

348
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,719
Take a good look, Tom,

349
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,599
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

350
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,479
Fuck! Opium and presidents!

351
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:19,319
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket. <i>..</i>

352
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,319
<i>..</i> .Then I wouldn'<i>t</i> blame you.

353
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,799
But this is my mission.

354
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,399
And I will have no limitations.

355
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,559
Where are you, Tom?

356
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,199
Hmm?

357
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,839
My big brother?

358
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,759
You know, you used to stop
sometimes and laugh.

359
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,439
Do you even remember
this place?

360
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,079
You walk into The Garrison
like a stranger

361
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,199
and you sip fucking water.

362
00:21:58,639 --> 00:21:59,959
But I'm alive, Ada.

363
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,479
Yeah.

364
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,599
And you're still looking for
trouble big enough to kill you.

365
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,279
Well...

366
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,359
...I think
you might have found <i>it.</i>

367
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,879
I have children, Tommy.

368
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,719
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

369
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,399
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison alley,

370
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,799
and the other
has no limitations.

371
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,119
I'm expected.

372
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,279
Oh, and Mr Solomons
no longer tolerates

373
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,719
the smoking of tobacco
in his presence.

374
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,159
I always thought that opera

375
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,679
was just fat people
fucking shouting.

376
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,399
Yeah? What do you think now?

377
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,839
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

378
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:33,359
reminds me of the crying out
of Italian soldiers

379
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,439
when they had my bayonet
inside them.

380
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,759
Ever since my own death,

381
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:42,119
I have been somewhat
haunted by <i>it.</i>

382
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:44,999
Dear me.

383
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,679
But instead of fighting
these voices,

384
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,839
I decided to write
their songs down,

385
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,119
you know, and turn them
into an opera of my own.

386
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,439
Do not light <i>that.</i>

387
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:59,399
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

388
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,839
What I was told, Alfie. <i>..</i>

389
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,639
<i>..</i> .Is that you have withdrawn

390
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,239
and that you spend your days
alone...

391
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,479
...obsessing
about opera singers.

392
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,359
Opera's not fucking singing,
is it?

393
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,799
It's not singing.

394
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,799
It is the sound
that people make. <i>..</i>

395
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,559
...before words.

396
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,559
And I do not allow smoking

397
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,479
because I do need to see
fucking clearly,

398
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,799
all right?

399
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,079
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

400
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,879
Not a sense of weakness,
no, Alfie.

401
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,359
- Huh?
- A certain knowledge of <i>it.</i>

402
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,399
Since you've been sat here,
writing your opera. <i>..</i>

403
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,479
<i>...a</i> member of your family
has died.

404
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,199
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

405
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,759
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging,

406
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,559
prostitution,
gambling syndicates

407
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,079
out of East Boston.

408
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,519
But last January,
poor old Charlie, well...

409
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:14,879
<i>..</i> .he was shot
in the Cotton Club,

410
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,319
in the lavatory,

411
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,959
by men that you know,

412
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,639
and <i>yet</i> you did nothing, Alfie.

413
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,119
Now, my opera is called
<i>America.</i>

414
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,519
<i>America</i> is my fucking
masterpiece!

415
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:37,519
The truth is,
your uncle is dead...

416
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,959
...Boston is gone...

417
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,559
...and you,

418
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,279
once the big man
who ran Camden Town. <i>..</i>

419
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:51,639
<i>...now</i> can'<i>t</i> even extinguish
another man's cigarette. <i>..</i>

420
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,799
...let alone his fucking life.

421
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,399
You need favours,

422
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,119
- Alfie.
- I need

423
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,959
a fucking final act, right?

424
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,799
Just a final fucking act
for my opera.

425
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,159
Yeah?

426
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,999
Alfie...

427
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,439
I think I may have
written your final act.

428
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,119
Why don'<i>t</i> you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

429
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,759
I have five tons of pure,
refined opium

430
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,039
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

431
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:56,399
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

432
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,079
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

433
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:05,039
Quebec, New York and Boston.

434
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,919
The income would be immediate

435
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,279
and would shift the balance
of power in Boston

436
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,839
back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

437
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:23,999
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

438
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,679
it is you
who takes the revenge.

439
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,599
Why would you sell?

440
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,039
The Irish are being difficult.

441
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,479
The Italians are not an option.

442
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,519
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

443
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,159
Pay you with credit?

444
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,279
- No.
- Oh...

445
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,839
I will take property.

446
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,919
You own half the warehouses
in Camden.

447
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,199
I'll take 'em
and knock 'em down,

448
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,159
build houses for the needy
and the deserving.

449
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,599
Oh.

450
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,599
Yeah, well, the, erm. <i>..</i>

451
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,599
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain'<i>t</i> they?

452
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:07,319
For about fucking 700 years.

453
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,919
You know that I once saw
an Irishman

454
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:15,599
arguing with the statue
of Oliver Cromwell

455
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,159
in Parliament Square.

456
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,199
The argument went on
for quite a while, actually.

457
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,279
It went into the night,

458
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,399
as his little voice echoed
all around

459
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,999
the Houses of Parliament

460
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,559
as he got more and more angered

461
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:29,199
Oliver Cromwell
was reluctant somewhat

462
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,879
to answer
his legitimate questions,

463
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:35,879
so angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

464
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:38,199
the statue on the nose

465
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,679
and broke his fucking hand.

466
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,199
And there it is, you know,
the Irish question, innit?

467
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,159
How come
you can remember so much

468
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,559
about what happened
200 years ago,

469
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,079
but you just can'<i>t</i> remember

470
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,999
what fucking happened
last night?

471
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,119
How much is a ton?

472
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,039
Johnny.

473
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:12,999
Only me today.

474
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,439
Jack says a few more weeks. <i>..</i>

475
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,479
<i>..</i> .Then you'll be free.

476
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,399
When do you travel to London?

477
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,199
Tomorrow.

478
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,759
I came to say goodbye.

479
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,759
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

480
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,359
Block your fucking ears,
if you have <i>to.</i>

481
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,159
I'll be with you, Michael.

482
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,399
I've been thinking about you.

483
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,759
Only you.

484
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,479
And don't worry
about Tommy Shelby.

485
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,639
I have no interest
in a dead man.

486
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,359
Jack says he has to die.

487
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,079
Well, you tell Jack to <i>wait.</i>

488
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,959
If anyone's going to kill
Tommy Shelby. <i>..</i>

489
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,399
It will be you.

490
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,519
I know.

491
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,559
I told Jack.

492
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,279
And Jack said, "OK.

493
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,359
"Let the kid do it."

494
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:47,279
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won'<i>t.</i>

495
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:52,639
$5 million.

496
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:56,159
The devil will be dead.

497
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,439
The future belongs to us.

498
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,359
Oh, and, uh, Michael...

499
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,599
Every night. <i>..</i>

500
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,559
...midnight in Boston,
5am in London...

501
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,839
<i>...</i> I'll be wide awake
in my big, wide bed,

502
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,879
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

503
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,479
And our souls
will come together. <i>..</i>

504
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,119
...and we'll fuck.

505
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,959
I won'<i>t</i> need an alarm clock.

506
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,319
And you won't sleep
until I'm done.

507
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,159
Midnight fucks 5am.

508
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,159
Every day.

509
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,919
Because we trust each other.

510
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,639
Hmm?

511
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,879
You're a fucking traitor,
Shelby! You're a fucking...

512
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,279
Darker.

513
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,919
Bluer.

514
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,759
Sharper.

515
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,239
I want to see it from below.

516
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,599
Darling, how's that?

517
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:02,679
You look absolutely terrifying,
my love.

518
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,239
Fuck lipstick.

519
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,319
Fun.

520
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,599
To launch the ship.

521
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,319
A long and terrible journey,
Diana.

522
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,759
Don'<i>t</i> fucking let me down.

523
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,759
Mr Shelby!

524
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,879
Mr Shelby!

525
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,359
<i>Daily Mirror.</i>

526
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,799
- Mr Shelby!
- Off!

527
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,439
May I ask <i>why</i> a socialist MP

528
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,719
would attend a fascist rally,
sir?

529
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,279
Let him in,
let me answer the question.

530
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,839
Mr Mosley's constituency
borders my own.

531
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,839
We have worked together
in the past.

532
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,519
He was once a socialist
himself.

533
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,319
My role here tonight

534
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,079
is <i>to...to</i> act as a bridge

535
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,959
between ideologies.

536
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,239
I'm in the middle.

537
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,559
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

538
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,079
Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight?

539
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,319
No. I am simply here
to remind my friend, Mr Mosley,

540
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,359
that the <i>way</i> of the British
people is compromise.

541
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:28,199
And you can print that, pal.

542
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,999
Fucking rag.

543
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,119
Lizzie, you should know

544
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,599
that Mosley's wife died
six months ago.

545
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,199
So give him your condolences,
will you?

546
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:48,119
Tonight,
he will be with his mistress,

547
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,039
who is apparently
a lady of some standing. <i>..</i>

548
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,759
...and has given him great
comfort in his time of grief.

549
00:35:56,959 --> 00:36:00,159
Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

550
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:02,279
Move out my fucking <i>way.</i>

551
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,079
What is Arthur doing here?

552
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,279
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

553
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,119
Arthur made me a promise,

554
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,559
which he appears
to have broken.

555
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:14,839
Move! I said fucking move.

556
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,159
I tried my best.
He's hid some junk in his sock.

557
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,079
- OK.
- Move along.

558
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,759
Oi!

559
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,319
- Oi, Tommy!
- Come on!

560
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,479
- Tommy!
- You're in! You're in.

561
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,199
- Come on, you're in.
- My brother.

562
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,479
- Tommy!
- Yeah.

563
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,159
Johnny Dogs.

564
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:34,679
Mosley invited me.

565
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,039
He said,
"Wear a black fucking shirt."

566
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,199
Here you are.

567
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,399
I said, "I'd look like
every other bastard."

568
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,719
Lizzie!

569
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,159
- Come on.
- For fuck's sake.

570
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:46,759
You're an angel. I know
I've fucking let you down.

571
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,959
I've fucking let you down,
I know I have. All right?

572
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,359
I've fucking said sorry
a million times

573
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,999
and I'll say it again.
I'm sorry, all right?

574
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,879
- Yeah.
- I'm fucking sorry.

575
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,199
Look at Johnny Dogs.

576
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:58,479
Fucking look
at the state of him.

577
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,879
He looks like a fucking waiter.

578
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,239
- Oh, shut up.
- Get me a fucking drink.

579
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,879
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

580
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,319
For fuck's sake, Tommy.

581
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:09,679
Take your fucking shirt off
and give it me now.

582
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,079
Get it off!

583
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,759
Arthur, this is my fault.

584
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,559
- This is my fault.
- Yeah.

585
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,119
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade?

586
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,999
- You voted no.
- I said no.

587
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,119
Remember? I overruled you.

588
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,479
I've not been here,
I've been <i>away.</i>

589
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,559
Where you been, Tom?

590
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,239
And Ada tells me you've been
hanging out with Mosley.

591
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,759
- Yeah, he's...
- Yeah?

592
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:33,119
In his big, beautiful
fucking house.

593
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,399
And they have parties there,
in Belgravia.

594
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,039
And they give me
fucking respect.

595
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,439
Yeah?
And what do you give them?

596
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,799
Snow and junk from the company.

597
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:41,919
Hang on.

598
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,199
Look at you, brother.

599
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,759
Half of you's gone.
Half of you's gone.

600
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,399
- What the fuck?
- Rag and bone.

601
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,159
You fucking slapped me.

602
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,679
You slapped me.

603
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:59,879
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

604
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:03,159
Unresolved.
Unresolved in everything.

605
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:05,639
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade,

606
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:07,679
and maintain the trust of both.

607
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,359
And I cannot have my brother
wearing a fucking black shirt

608
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,079
on the cover
of the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

609
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,079
If anyone takes my picture
in this,

610
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,319
they'll find their fucking
camera under my heel, Tom.

611
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:19,279
They are throwing petrol bombs
out there, Tommy.

612
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,239
I thought Ada was
taking care of you.

613
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,919
Ada's got decisions to make
about working with us.

614
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,959
She doesn'<i>t</i> know
what she wants.

615
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,799
I'll speak to Ada.

616
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,719
Listen, I'm going home,
all right?

617
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,159
No, you stay there.

618
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,079
I have something for you.

619
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,519
Lizzie, you can go in
with Johnny.

620
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,039
Johnny, take Lizzie
to her seat.

621
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,719
But I don'<i>t</i> have an invitation,
Tom.

622
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
Johnny, you're wearing
a fucking black shirt,

623
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,799
you can do what you like.
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

624
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,399
Go on, Dogs.

625
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,839
And get me a fucking drink
while you're there.

626
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,239
I know, Tom. Look at me.

627
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,759
Arthur, before I went
to America,

628
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,279
I wrote a letter.

629
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,919
Yeah? Who to?

630
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,519
To Linda.

631
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,279
And in that letter, I wrote,

632
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:11,039
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

633
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,239
"do you believe
in forgiveness?"

634
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,239
And this is what I got back.

635
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,479
Two days ago. Have a look.

636
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,999
"As a Christian woman,

637
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,839
"I do believe in forgiveness."

638
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,519
Yeah, and the word <i>do</i>
is underlined.

639
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,839
Arthur, I'm no Christian.

640
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,159
But I also believe
in forgiveness.

641
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,399
So, get yourself clean,

642
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,959
stay clean for <i>two</i> weeks,

643
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,119
I'll write Linda
another letter.

644
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,159
Cos I know where she is.

645
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,519
First, I need you back.

646
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,279
I need my brother.

647
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,439
I have a lot to do.

648
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,719
Need someone
to do the real work.

649
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,439
Yeah.

650
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,439
Yeah. Look at your smile, Tom.

651
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,439
Look at your smile, brother.

652
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,719
It's been so long.

653
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,759
Come on. Let's see what this
bastard has to say. Come on.

654
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,479
- All right. All right.
- Come on.

655
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,919
Yeah, I'm coming.

656
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,319
He is a bastard an' all, Tommy.

657
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:33,039
Black shirts and Jews.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.

658
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,679
Stay in the middle
and do nothing, Tommy.

659
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,679
But not fucking me.

660
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,359
Come here, you,
you Nazi bastard!

661
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,839
Come here, man,
I'll take your fucking eye.

662
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,439
Not here! <i>Not</i> here!

663
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,599
Come here. You've had your fun,
now let's go home.

664
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,919
We have business.

665
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,719
Johnny, you get him home.

666
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,239
This time,
check his fucking socks.

667
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,119
For fuck's sake!

668
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:32,879
Tommy, we should get out now.

669
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:35,959
Forget this American business.
We've got enough.

670
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,399
Not near enough.
Here she comes.

671
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,479
Remember to smile. Come on.

672
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,919
Shit.

673
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,519
Ladies and gentlemen,

674
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,439
tonight, he has truly earned
your adulation.

675
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,999
The future Prime Minister
of this great country,

676
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,399
Sir Oswald Mosley!

677
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,519
Fuck you, Mosley!

678
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,159
Fuck. I look terrible.

679
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:43,039
You look beautiful, Lizzie.
I need to impress this woman,

680
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,479
so I will act
as if she is beautiful as well.

681
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,239
Mosley.

682
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,239
Diana,

683
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,959
this is Tommy Shelby MP, OBE.

684
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,119
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

685
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,039
Oswald's most recent
and last-ever mistress.

686
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,279
This is my wife, Lizzie Shelby.

687
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,439
Beautiful earrings.

688
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:06,039
Oh, I stole them
from Tiffany's.

689
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,639
Actually, he bought
the earrings in Paris.

690
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:10,479
We were in Paris
on our honeymoon.

691
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:12,039
- God, I hate Paris.
- Hmm.

692
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,319
I hear you prefer Berlin.

693
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:16,159
Oswald and I are going to marry
there, aren'<i>t</i> we, Oswald?

694
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:17,439
Hmm.

695
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:20,239
Mosley, I have business
to discuss.

696
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,799
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

697
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:27,679
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

698
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:29,999
that we men go off
and discuss business

699
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,359
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

700
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,239
Goodness.

701
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:37,479
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

702
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,399
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

703
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,679
But, Mr Shelby,
if it's business,

704
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,159
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

705
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:48,199
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

706
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,399
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

707
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,919
I will join the meeting
as well.

708
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:55,279
But of course, you <i>must</i> come
as well, Elizabeth.

709
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,439
By the way,
I really don'<i>t</i> like "Lizzie".

710
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,719
I prefer liberated "Elizabeth".

711
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,399
She must be part of this.

712
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:02,999
She's been
all the <i>way to</i> Paris,

713
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,759
so she is a woman of the world.
Bravo.

714
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:08,119
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you. <i>..</i>

715
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,759
Only three. <i>..</i>

716
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,679
...because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn'<i>t.</i>

717
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,559
Our friend in Berlin
doesn'<i>t</i> either.

718
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:29,399
Well, they have <i>that</i> in common,
at least.

719
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,839
Oh, I imagine
they have lots in common.

720
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,119
Hmm.

721
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,319
Report to me, Shelby.

722
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:39,559
Officially,
Jack Nelson is in London

723
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,119
to buy import licences.

724
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:47,119
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

725
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,359
Well, as you can see
from this private letter. <i>..</i>

726
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,599
...he is far
from a neutral point of view.

727
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,319
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

728
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:04,159
"Individually Jews are fine,
but as a race they stink."

729
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:05,719
Hmm.

730
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,479
Elizabeth, do you even know
<i>why</i> the bridge

731
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,959
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

732
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,559
Actually, no.

733
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,839
I don'<i>t</i> really know much
about this business at all.

734
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:26,719
But I have fucked
your future husband,

735
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:29,119
so I know lots of things
about him.

736
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,199
Tommy, I'll be outside.

737
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,519
Well done, Elizabeth.

738
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:42,479
Do you people want
to meet Nelson or no?

739
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:47,519
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

740
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:49,079
If you like.

741
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,559
Of course we would.

742
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:53,399
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

743
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,319
But, Mr Shelby,

744
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:58,199
before this <i>enterprise</i>
goes any further,

745
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,279
you really must do
something about your wife.

746
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:30,239
Mr Shelby.

747
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,639
Yes.

748
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:34,039
Mr Nelson.

749
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,519
I came early.

750
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,119
I wanted to come
and take a look

751
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,279
around this beautiful church.

752
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,999
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

753
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,719
I hoped that by suggesting
we meet in church,

754
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,079
it might make us both
more...cautious

755
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,959
with lies and truth.

756
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,399
Well, your hope
would be forlorn.

757
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,119
There ain'<i>t</i> no-one listening
here.

758
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:00,919
You don't believe in God?

759
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,199
No.

760
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:07,639
It was the <i>way</i> Catholics
were treated in my country

761
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,559
that made me angry.

762
00:47:10,879 --> 00:47:12,519
Made me what I became.

763
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,279
What made you angry?

764
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:24,119
Slowness...in anything.

765
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,799
I wanted to have everything
already.

766
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,839
Two working-class
Catholic boys.

767
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,039
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

768
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,239
Some man in the shadows.

769
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,119
I carried a screwdriver
and a blade,

770
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,839
and everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

771
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,519
And do you?

772
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,439
Yes, I do.

773
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,599
First man I killed
was a priest.

774
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,759
You?

775
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,919
A Prussian boy with green eyes.

776
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,999
He was already underground.

777
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,679
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

778
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:16,639
Four years ago.

779
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:20,959
His name was Thomas Shelby.

780
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:23,879
He drank whiskey.

781
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:30,639
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

782
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:33,319
and deal narcotics
that'll kill people?

783
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,039
You deal in whiskey, Mr Nelson.

784
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:44,559
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

785
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,239
which said that whiskey
disproportionately kills

786
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,039
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

787
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,399
whereas opium is the sedative

788
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,399
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

789
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,239
In return,
there are people in England

790
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:03,559
who you think I should meet?

791
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,159
Yes.

792
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,599
Yes, like minds.

793
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,559
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

794
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,999
The booze
of the blue blood elite.

795
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,199
In America, <i>we... we</i> like
labels and aspiration.

796
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:27,679
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

797
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,759
You can add that
to your portfolio.

798
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,159
I hear Shelby labels are
favoured by the working class.

799
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:37,199
Indeed.
A fact of which I'm very proud.

800
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,679
They say you are a poet, too.

801
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,759
No, I only read <i>it.</i>

802
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,999
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

803
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:53,719
Fascists.

804
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,399
Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

805
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:58,479
The ones in tuxedos.

806
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,999
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

807
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,679
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

808
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:07,719
For many years now,

809
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,719
I have been working closely
with Winston Churchill,

810
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,599
in many different capacities.

811
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,919
I have his trust.

812
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:16,319
He's opposed
to the rise of fascism.

813
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:19,559
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

814
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,239
Well, I can give you
men of influence

815
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,159
who support your cause.

816
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:27,479
I can also offer you
a full report

817
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,839
on Churchill's strategies.

818
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:36,239
All this in return for access
to South Boston?

819
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:37,879
Alternatively,

820
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:41,079
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

821
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:42,879
without my intelligence,

822
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,519
and I can sell my opium
to the Jews.

823
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,919
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

824
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,319
A war hero, I hear.

825
00:50:57,439 --> 00:50:59,679
Every war hero I ever met,

826
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:02,359
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

827
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,279
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

828
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,959
I'll think a great deal
about what you've said.

829
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,919
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

830
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,679
Ruby?

831
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:51,519
Ruby?

832
00:51:56,919 --> 00:51:58,799
Ruby?

833
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:04,159
Ruby?

834
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:07,599
What are you doing, love?

835
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,599
I can hear voices...

836
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,679
<i>..</i> .coming from up the chimney.

837
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:17,079
What voices?

838
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,719
The grey man.

839
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:24,359
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

840
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:26,439
Mr Thomas Shelby.

841
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,559
Birmingham South.

842
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:33,759
Mr Speaker.
I was raised in a family

843
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:36,679
that endured living conditions
that would test

844
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:39,719
the morality of
even the most virtuous.

845
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:40,999
Indeed...

846
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,559
Indeed, even the best of us
would have our virtues trounced

847
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:47,039
and thwarted by life
in the meanness

848
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:50,119
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

849
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,839
What would you know
about virtue?

850
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,359
Quickly, please.

851
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,079
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

852
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,839
a bill which will offer
radical reform

853
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:11,679
in housing policy
in this country,

854
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,719
in which slums are cleared,

855
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,919
new houses are built

856
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,359
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

857
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,479
Westminster 245.
House of Commons.

858
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:34,839
The time has come for change,
the people have had enough.

859
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:37,719
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

860
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,799
build a new Jerusalem

861
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,759
brick by
Government-owned brick.

862
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,199
Into there.

863
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:55,359
Good.

864
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:01,279
Doctor?

865
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:06,639
Yeah, Westminster 245.

866
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:12,799
Mr Shelby.

867
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,599
<i>"Tickner maura, o beng,
o beng" over and over again.</i>

868
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:35,799
<i>How is the family?</i>

869
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:37,439
<i>And one of you will die.</i>

870
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:38,839
<i>He's staring at me, Daddy.</i>

871
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,719
<i>A man with green eyes.</i>

872
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:42,999
Can you stop the voices?

873
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,279
There are no voices, my love.

874
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:49,839
It's the grey man.

875
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:51,839
He says he's coming for me...

876
00:54:53,399 --> 00:54:56,039
...and he's coming
for Daddy as well.

877
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,039
Sh...

878
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:11,559
Mr Shelby?

879
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,559
Is everything all right
in there?

880
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,439
Mr Shelby?

881
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:19,999
Everything's fine.

882
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:22,679
Everything's fine.

883
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:36,759
- Hello?
<i>- Tommy.</i>

884
00:56:36,879 --> 00:56:39,759
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

885
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,639
- Just get here now.
<i>- Lizzie?</i>

886
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:43,879
- Please.
- Lizzie?

887
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,359
Where is she?

888
00:57:08,479 --> 00:57:10,319
She's with the doctor upstairs.

889
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,279
Listen, Tommy.

890
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,759
He said we shouldn'<i>t</i> come close
to her, in case...

891
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:18,519
In case of what?

892
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,759
When she coughs, there's blood.

893
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,639
Madonna,

894
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:45,399
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.

895
