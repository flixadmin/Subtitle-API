Barnes.

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,424
So, it seems anyone could've
gotten access to that bathroom.

Not just the guests.

All right. Start with statements
from everyone at the party.

30
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,243
Someone saw Symon go into that bathroom.

31
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,494
Okay.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,252
I still can't believe it.

33
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,977
I'm sorry things went down this way.

34
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,836
Don't apologize. You were right.

35
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,231
Did you give your statement already?

36
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,654
I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.

37
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,276
Until about an hour ago,
I couldn't pick Symon out of a crowd.

38
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,572
Did you talk to Barnes at the party?

39
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,261
A little. We had a drink.

40
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,516
Symon died around 10:30.
The attack happened just before.

41
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,650
What time did you talk with Barnes?

42
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,857
9:00. What is this about?

43

(SIGHS) Nothing.

44
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,816
Nothing, really?

45
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,447
I can't talk about it.

46
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,322
- No.
- Lee, I cannot talk about it.

47
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,090
Jim, I hope you know what you're doing.

48
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,533
Me, too.

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,668
Barnes? No. No, no, no, no, no.

50
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,588
I asked Symon who attacked him.
And he said Barnes.

51
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,210
Symon was a psychopath

52
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,968
who gave face transplants
to the mob using stolen faces.

53
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,344
Hardly a credible witness.

54
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,507
And this guy Barnes,
if he so much as jaywalked,

55
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,393
- he would write himself a ticket.
- I know.

56
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,095
And now you're saying he went to
Lee Thompkins' engagement party,

57
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,943
and out of nowhere,
busted some guy's face

58
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,253
and chucked him through a wall.

59
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,440
I know, Harvey.

60
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,063
- What's the motive?
- I don't know.

61
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,818
Maybe he saw Symon.

62
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,230
He got pissed he was released,
and he lost control.

63
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,357
Okay. So, you're saying

64
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,409
that a man with a spotless 20-year career
just went ape.

65
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,740
Is that your theory?

66
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,946
You know, something's been
off about him recently.

67
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,200
You yourself said
he nearly beat Tetch to death.

68
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,458
And what's with him insisting on running
point in the Paulie Pennies' case?

69
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,820
Look, I don't know,
but that does not make him a killer.

70
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,707
So where is he now?

71
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,920
Home? He spent the better part
of yesterday chasing down Symon.

72
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,509
Maybe he's tired.
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

73
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,887
The last thing I want is
for Barnes to be guilty.

74
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,139
I look up to the man.

75
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,679
But if there is even a chance,
then we have to know.

76
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,605
And something doesn't feel right.

77
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,983
Okay. Okay. Look, I'm gonna help you.

78
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,485
But, just so you know,

79
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,355
I'm doing it to prove he's innocent,
not guilty.

80
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,562
It's fine. All right.
So, I'll go back to the scene.

some prints from the bathroom.

00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,901
Hello.

166
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,322
This is Edward Nygma.

167
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,580
Why?

168
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,419
Very well.

169
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,919
It was the GCPD.

170
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,340
They wanna see me,
wouldn't say why.

171
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,762
Oh?

172
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,471
You don't think that something happened?

173
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,814
No!

The officer said Isabella
blew through a red light

179
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,050
and crashed into a train.

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,589
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

182
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,516
Yours was the last number in her phone.

183
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,684
I am so, so sorry, Ed.

184
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,650
Did she suffer?

185
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,942
No.

186
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,497
Anything you need, Ed, anything at all,

187
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,081
I am here for you.

Lady, you got two seconds
to get out of here

194
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,248
before I gut you like a fish.

195
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,409
You really don't recognize me?

196
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,125
Selina, it's me. Ivy?

197
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,421
Hey, you got anything to eat
around here? I'm starving.

198
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,384
- Yeah.
- BULLOCK: Jim, I'm outside the scene.

199
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,593
Forensics found tons of prints
inside the bathroom

200
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,641
where Symon was attacked.

201
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,772
- Barnes?
- That just means he was in there.

202
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,974
It puts him at the scene.

203
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,263
Listen, I've been thinking.

204
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,526
You gotta tell Barnes what Symon said.

205
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,395
Give him the right to defend himself.

206
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,943
I will

207
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,112
when I'm ready.

208
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,630
Help you?

209
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,545
Captain.

210
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,139
I was looking for
the Paulie Pennies file.

211
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,350
Thinking the cases might be related.

212
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,190
Thanks.

213
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,319
Fill me in.

214
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,657
- Nothing hard, yet. But we'll get there.
- Uh-huh.

215
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,775
I was reading through
some of the witness statements.

216
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,081
The couple from the alley?

217
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,666
They say when they found Symon,
he was still alive.

218
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,956
You were first on the scene.
Did he say anything to you?

219
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,298
No.

220
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,710
He didn't ID the killer?

221
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,254
No.

222
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,765
Ah. 'Cause one of the witnesses seems
to think that you were talking to him.

223
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,480
He tried, sure. But he couldn't speak.

224
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,729
He died almost right away.

225
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,684
Uh-huh.

226
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,190
Well, for what it's worth,

227
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,701
I called an old Cl of mine
with deep ties to the mob.

228
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,954
He says that once I collared Symon,
the higher ups got jumpy.

229
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,710
You're saying the mob had him killed.

230
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,917
He was giving these guys new faces.

231
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,248
He was probably the only one
who can ID them.

232
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,216
That's a lot to protect.

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,797
Makes sense.

234
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,552
My Cl also had a name.
Mid-level enforcer goes by Sugar.

235
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,137
Works out of the East End.
Says he actually did the killing.

236
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,543
I'll have a team pick him up.

237
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,116
I'd rather you kept this between us.

238
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,014
The mob still has their fingers
in most of these guys' pockets.

239
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,084
You never know who you can trust.

240
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,565
So, you ready to ride with the old man?

241
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,024
- Sure. Just let me run it by my partner.
- Why bother him?

242
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,409
We'll be there and back
before you know it.

243
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,899
JIM: So, where are we headed?

244
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,962
Sugar works out of an old foundry
at 133rd and 6th.

245
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,414
Oh, that reminds me.

246
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,925
BULLOCK: It's Harvey. Leave a message.

247
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,092
I'm with Barnes,
heading to 133rd and 6th. Get there.

248
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,444
You never know what's gonna go down.

249
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,296
BARNES: I have to say, Jim.

250
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,382
I'm disappointed with you.

251
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh, yeah? How is that?

252
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,300
Lead Detective for a high-profile murder,

253
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,725
and you don't collect statements
from everyone present?

254
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,557
Me.

255
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,762
(CHUCKLES)

256
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,392
Well, then, let's do it now.

257
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,691
And, for the record,
I waive my right to counsel.

258
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,856
- Captain...
- Ask your questions, Gordon.

259
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,653
Did you see Symon at the party?

260
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,401
Yes.

261
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,158
Did you talk to him?

262
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,454
No, I did not.

263
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,265
Did you see him go into the bathroom
before he was attacked?

264
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,664
Unfortunately, no.

265
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,003
Were you ever in it?

266
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,163
Yes.

267
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,506
Before it was a crime scene. Obviously.

268
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,261
So, Detective, am I in the clear?

269
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,842
For now.

270
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,009
(CHUCKLES)

271
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,524
This city is a cesspool.

272
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,019
Don't you ever wanna do
something about it?

273
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,650
I thought I was.

274
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,032
What, as a cop?

275
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,869
I would think that you of all people
would find that limiting.

276
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,659
Not anymore.

277
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,621
I came back to the GCPD
to do things right.

278
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,869
Like you.

279
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,712
Like me?

280
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,132
Last year, at Galavan's,
when we were attacked,

281
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,469
you told me the law shows you
where the line is.

282
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,045
It stuck with me.

283
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,257
Some would say that our job,
first and foremost,

284
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,434
is to protect the citizens of this city,

285
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,225
even if it means bending the laws.

286
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,356
No. We break the law,
we're no better than the criminals.

287
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,110
(CHUCKLES) Is that what you were thinking
the night that Galavan was killed?

288
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,365
The first time.
This city is at a crossroads, Gordon.

289
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,904
Question is, will good men fight for it?

290
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,331
Will they do what's necessary?

291
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,618
The decision is yours to make.

292
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,885
You passed our stop. 133rd and 6th?

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,095
Did I say that? 136th and 3rd.

294
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,927
It's an honest mistake.

295
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,888
BRUCE: I don't believe it.

296
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,898
Well, I should've known.

297
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,270
I saw what that freak Marv could do.

298
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,322
How he could age people.

299
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,494
And when you told me that the girl
wearing her sweater was older, I...

300
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,412
I should've realized.

301
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,364
BRUCE: That's really Ivy.

302
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,751
Trust me.
She came and literally ate all my food.

303
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,750
Immediately ate all my food. It's her.

304
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,043
So why is she back here?

305
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,625
Good question.

306
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,133
Ow!

307
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,633
- What was that for?
- For being alive and not telling me!

308
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,061
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,106
(SIGHS)

310
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,105
I was just having fun.

311
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,393
BRUCE: Why'd you come back?

312
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,069
I don't have to answer your questions.
Why'd you call him anyway?

313
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,740
'Cause you freaked me out.

314
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,200
Where have you been?
And why are you dressed like that?

315
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,997
Oh. It's so crazy.

316
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,127
Selina, when you look like this,

317
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,044
guys just come up to you
and give you stuff.

318
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,084
Half the time
you don't even have to steal it.

319
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,468
Hmm. And what do you give them?

320
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,680
Hmm. I have ways of getting what I want.

321
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,516
- I'll bet.
- You do look nice.

322
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,514
(SCOFFS)

323
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,943
So why did you come back?
And don't say it's 'cause you missed me.

324
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,478
It's true.

325
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,569
You may be 10 feet tall,
but you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.

326
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,571

00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,267
What?

643
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,440
I went to the intersection where she died.

644
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,814
It is four blocks from her apartment.

645
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,595
Who falls asleep four blocks
from their home? No one!

646
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,689
Also, a very fragrant homeless man
said that he heard her scream,

647
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,816
before the crash,
so definitely not asleep.

648
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,576
Now, if she were awake,
why didn't she brake?

649
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,458
- Why are there no skid marks?

650
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,910
Ed, you are exhausted.
You are emotional.

651
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,991
Her brake lines were cut!

652
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,370
Which leaves one conclusion. Murder.

653
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,582
- No!
- Yes.

654
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,875
And I know who did it.

655
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,045
Who?

656
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,139
Butch.

657
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,136
- Butch?
- In retaliation.

658
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,398
For exposing him as the leader
of the Red Hood Gang.

659
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,229
(GASPS)

660
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,854
That makes perfect sense.

661
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,072
I swear to you, Ed,

662
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,201
we will find him and make him pay
for what he has done!

663
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,240
Thank you.

664
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,533
(CHUCKLES)

665
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,740
I knew I could count on you.

666
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,578
(CHUCKLING)

667
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,210
I feel like this office is cursed.

668
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,153
You think Barnes will be all right?

669
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,632
I don't know.

670
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:57,061
- I'm sorry I doubted you.
- You didn't. Not when it mattered.
