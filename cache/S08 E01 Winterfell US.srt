1
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,812
You should consider yourself lucky.

2
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,693
-At least your balls won't freeze off.
-You take great offense at dwarf jokes,

3
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,987
but love telling eunuch jokes.
Why is that?

4
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,033
Because I have balls, and you don't.

5
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,564
I warned you.
Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

6
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,158
May the Gods protect us!

7
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,772
Look at you.

8
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,483
You're a man.

9
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,652
Almost.

10
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,716
-Where's Arya?
-Lurking somewhere.

11
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,100
Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

12
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,522
My sister, Sansa Stark,
the Lady of Winterfell.

13
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,025
Thank you for inviting us into your home,
Lady Stark.

14
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,738
The North is as beautiful
as your brother claimed, as are you.

15
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,952
Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

16
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,623
We don't have time for all this.

17
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,460
The Night King has your dragon.
He's one of them now.

18
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,547
The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.

19
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,764
As soon as we heard about the Wall,

20
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,433
I called all our banners
to retreat to Winterfell.

21
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,977
Lord Umber,

22
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,439
when can we expect your people to arrive?

23
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,822
We need more horses and wagons,
if it please my lady.

24
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,285
And my lord.

25
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,164
And my queen.

26
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,252
-Sorry.
-You'll have as many as we can spare.

27
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,088
Hurry back to Last Hearth
and bring your people here.

28
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,677
We need to send ravens
to the Night's Watch as well.

29
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,263
There's no sense
in manning the castles anymore.

30
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,015
-We make our stand here.
-At once, Your Grace.

31
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,017
"Your Grace?"

32
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,984
But you're not. Are you?

33
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,654
You left Winterfell a king
and came back a…

34
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,741
I'm not sure what you are now.

35
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,369
A lord?

36
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,496
Nothing at all?

37
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,708
-It's not important.
-Not important?

38
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,003
We named you King in the North.

39
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,131
King in the North!

40
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,013
You did, my lady.

41
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,768
It was the honor of my life.
I'll always be grateful for your faith.

42
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,317
But when I left Winterfell, I told you
we need allies or we will die.

43
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,113
I have brought those allies home
to fight alongside us.

44
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,824
I had a choice,

45
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,619
keep my crown or protect the North.

46
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,205
I chose the North.

47
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,014
If anyone survives the war to come,
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

48
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,101
He risked his life to show us
the threat is real.

49
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,603
Thanks to his courage,

50
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,773
we have brought with us the greatest army
the world has ever seen.

51
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,151
We have brought two full-grown dragons.

52
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,366
And soon, the Lannister army
will ride north to join our cause.

53
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,499
I know, I know, our people
haven't been friends in the past.

54
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,795
But we must fight together now...

55
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,963
or die.

56
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:38,096
May I ask, how are we meant to feed
the greatest army the world has ever seen?

57
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,431
While I ensured our stores
would last through winter,

58
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:45,686
I didn't account for Dothraki,
Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

59
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,357
What do dragons eat, anyway?

60
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,693
Whatever they want.

61
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,089
Hey, careful, lads.

62
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,426
-We need every last bit of it.
-Sorry about that.

63
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,849
Are these the last of the wagons?

64
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,893
-Aye.
-Let's get it all to the forges.

65
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,570
My lord.

66
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,781
My lady.

67
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,497
My lady.

68
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,094
The Lady of Winterfell.

69
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,055
Has a nice ring to it.

70
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,349
So does Hand of the Queen.

71
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,895
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

72
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,066
Last time we spoke
was at Joffrey's wedding.

73
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,362
-Miserable affair.
-It had its moments.

74
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,372
-Apologies for leaving like that.
-Yes, it was a bit hard to explain

75
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,708
why my wife fled moments after
the king's murder.

76
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,712
We both survived.

77
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,217
Many underestimated you.

78
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,094
Most of them are dead now.

79
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,648
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
the Lannister army's marching north.

80
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,569
You have every right
to be fearful of my sister.

81
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,323
No one fears her more than I do.
But I promise, you'll be safe--

82
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,160
Cersei told you her army
was coming north to fight for you?

83
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,620
She did.

84
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,248
And you believed her?

85
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,128
She has something to live for now.
I believe she wants to survive.

86
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,634
I used to think
you were the cleverest man alive.

87
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,042
You used to be taller.

88
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,505
How did you sneak up on me?

89
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,632
How did you survive a knife
through the heart?

90
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,509
I didn't.

91
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,529
You still have it.

92
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:27,908
Needle.

93
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,329
Have you ever used it?

94
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,040
Once or twice.

95
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,098
Valyrian steel.

96
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,435
Jealous?

97
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,979
Too heavy for me.

98
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,114
Where were you before?

99
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,242
I could've used your help with Sansa.

100
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,538
She doesn't like your queen, does she?

101
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,416
Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

102
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,836
She's the smartest person I've ever met.

103
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,007
Now you're defending her? You?

104
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,802
I'm defending our family.

105
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,931
-So is she.
-Yeah.

106
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,142
I'm her family too.

107
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,441
Don't forget that.

108
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,838
Your Grace, I'm afraid
I bring terrible news.

109
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,757
The dead have broken through the Wall.

110
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,429
Good.

111
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,466
Why don't you just get it over with
and kill me?

112
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,385
But we're family.

113
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,389
The last Greyjoys left in the world.

114
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,770
The last ones with balls anyway.

115
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,901
If I kill you...

116
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,695
who can I talk to?

117
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,827
I've got a crew full of mutes.

118
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,916
It gets lonely at sea.

119
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,128
Are we in King's Landing?

120
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,053
You picked the losing side.

121
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,351
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
somewhere else.

122
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,820
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

123
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,213
-Twenty-thousand men, is it?
-Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

124
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,925
They cheated at dice.

125
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,097
Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated.

126
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,518
They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.

127
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,687
-Horses?
-Two thousand.

128
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,649
-And elephants?
-No elephants, Your Grace.

129
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,443
That's disappointing.

130
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,447
I was told the Golden Company
had elephants.

131
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:40,452
They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,
but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

132
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,288
In any event,

133
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,665
you are most welcome in King's Landing,
Captain Strickland.

134
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,085
We look forward to fighting
on your behalf, Your Grace.

135
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,806
Am I most welcome here?

136
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,812
You are a true friend of the crown
and an honored guest.

137
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:11,191
Good. As a true friend
and an honored guest…

138
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,245
I was hoping we could talk in private.

139
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,749
After the war. That was our agreement.

140
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,377
Wars sometimes last years.

141
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,505
You want a whore, buy one.

142
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,509
You want a queen,

143
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,845
earn her.

144
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,224
How?

145
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,271
I've given her justice, an army
and the Iron Fleet,

146
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,524
yet she gives me no sign of affection.

147
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,694
My heart is nearly broken.

148
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,323
You're insolent.

149
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,912
-I've executed men for less.
-They were lesser men.

150
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,621
I hear the dragon burnt up
a thousand Lannister men.

151
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,331
Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

152
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,333
-Archie, was it?
-And William.

153
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,378
-Tall handsome William?
-Yeah, tall handsome William.

154
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,880
They said what's left of him
could fit in a wine glass.

155
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,925
I am the only man you ever met
who shot a dragon.

156
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,386
-Did you?
-Nearly killed it.

157
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,470
That's brave.

158
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,150
-That boy Eddie…
-The ginger?

159
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,236
That's him. Came back
with his face burnt right off.

160
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,904
He's got no eyelids now.

161
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,698
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

162
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,159
All right, can we stop talking
about the fucking dragons now?

163
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,577
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

164
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,372
You're kidding me.

165
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,250
Apologies for the interruption,
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

166
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,838
Sorry, ladies.

167
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,342
Another time perhaps.

168
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,394
You ever get lonely,
I am partial to older gentlemen.

169
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,901
Poor girl. The pox will take her
within the year.

170
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,279
Which girl?

171
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,823
The queen's brothers made promises
to you and broke them.

172
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,659
Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

173
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,916
She once gave me a castle and a wife,
then rectified me right out of them.

174
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,626
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

175
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,089
When Queen Cersei wants something,
she pays in advance and in gold.

176
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,593
Several chests of it, in fact.
Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

177
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,602
So she wants to murder someone,
but she can't send her soldiers.

178
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,855
If it's the Dragon Queen she's after--

179
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,857
She has other plans
for the Targaryen girl.

180
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,193
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

181
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,197
Our queen's brothers are unlikely
to survive their Northern adventures.

182
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,616
But in the event that they do…

183
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,543
She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

184
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,754
That fucking family.

185
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,800
When the Citadel expelled me, I thought
I would die poor and alone,

186
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,762
but in exchange for my service,
Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

187
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,016
What would she do for the man who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

188
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,451
I wanted those elephants.

189
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,834
So…

190
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,423
how do I compare to the fat king?

191
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,677
-You're insulting my late husband?
-Are you offended?

192
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,267
Robert had a different whore every night,

193
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,645
but he still didn't know his way around
a woman's body.

194
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,231
And the Kingslayer?

195
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,739
You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

196
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,870
-Life is boring.
-You're not boring, I'll give you that.

197
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,467
Do I please the Queen?

198
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,263
You might be the most arrogant man
I've ever met.

199
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,892
I like that.

200
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,063
But now I want to be alone.

201
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,447
I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

202
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,210
Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,

203
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,756
not if he's in King's Landing
with all his men and his ships.

204
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,759
We can take our home back.

205
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,094
Daenerys went north.

206
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,889
Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat
if they can't hold the North.

207
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,391
Somewhere the dead can't go.

208
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,650
You're my queen. I go where you command.

209
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,867
You want to go to Winterfell.
To fight for the Starks.

210
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,830
Go.

211
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,379
What is dead may never die.

212
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,842
What is dead may never die.

213
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,849
But kill the bastards anyway.

214
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,673
Welcome back, my lady.
If you'd follow me…

215
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,718
-The Karstarks.
-One of the better sigils.

216
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,388
Beats an onion, anyway.

217
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,266
Can't argue with that.

218
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,310
Not so long ago,
the Starks and the Karstarks

219
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,187
were slaughtering each other
on the battlefield.

220
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,774
-Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.
-And our queen is grateful.

221
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,902
Her gratitude is lovely,
but that's not my point.

222
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,158
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow,
not to her. They don't know her.

223
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,493
The Free Folk don't know her.

224
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,079
I've been up here a while,
and I'm telling you,

225
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,747
they're stubborn as goats.

226
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,001
You want their loyalty,
you have to earn it.

227
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,848
I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

228
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,143
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

229
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,480
On the off chance that we survive
the Night King,

230
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,234
what if the Seven Kingdoms,
for once in their whole shit history,

231
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,738
were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

232
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,161
-They do make a handsome couple.
-You overestimate our influence.

233
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,498
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen
to lonely old men.

234
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,624
I'm not that old.

235
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,002
Not as old as him.

236
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,257
-Our Queen respects the wisdom of age.
-Of course she does.

237
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,344
Respect is how the young
keep us at a distance,

238
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,096
so we don't remind them
of an unpleasant truth.

239
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
What is that?

240
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,643
Nothing lasts.

241
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,362
Your sister doesn't like me.

242
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,118
She doesn't know you.

243
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,622
If it makes you feel any better,

244
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,290
she didn't like me either
when we were growing up.

245
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,334
She doesn't need to be my friend…

246
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,337
but I am her queen.

247
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,051
If she can't respect me…

248
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,282
-What's the matter?
-The dragons are barely eating.

249
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,261
-What's wrong with them?
-They don't like the North.

250
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,820
Go on.

251
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,706
-I don't know how to ride a dragon.
-Nobody does, until they ride a dragon.

252
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,002
What if he doesn't want me to?

253
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,796
Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

254
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,901
What do I hold onto?

255
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,654
Whatever you can.

256
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,564
You've completely ruined horses for me.

257
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,700
We could stay a 1000 years…

258
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,078
no one would find us.

259
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,082
We'd be pretty old.

260
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,929
-It's cold up here for a southern girl.
-So keep your queen warm.

261
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,986
Don't be afraid.

262
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,387
-Gendry?
-He's here.

263
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,396
It isn't easy making a blade that big
with dragonglass.

264
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,109
You're saying you're good, is that it?

265
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,111
I'm just saying
it's a tricky material to--

266
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,029
You know who makes weapons
for the wildlings?

267
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,824
Cripples and cocksuckers.

268
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,244
-Which one are you?
-Leave him be.

269
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,961
I heard you were here.

270
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,132
You left me to die.

271
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,426
First I robbed you.

272
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,440
You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?

273
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,029
Guess that's why you're still alive.

274
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,830
That was a nice axe you made for him.

275
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,251
-You've gotten better.
-Yeah, thanks. So have you.

276
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,838
I mean, you look good.

277
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,383
Thanks. So do you.

278
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,431
It's not a bad place to grow up,
if it wasn't so cold.

279
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,395
-Stay close to that forge, then.
-Is that a command, Lady Stark?

280
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,774
-Don't call me that.
-As you wish, my lady.

281
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,240
Here's my wish.

282
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,036
Can you make it?

283
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,539
-What do you need something like this for?
-Can you make it or not?

284
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,083
You already have a sword.

285
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,043
What's that?

286
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,469
It's Valyrian steel. I always knew
you were just another rich girl.

287
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,140
You don't know any other rich girls.

288
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,986
Come in.

289
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,787
Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,

290
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,373
but he's staying in Deepwood Motte
with his men.

291
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,586
"House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

292
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,338
as we have for a 1000 years."

293
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,011
-Isn't that what he said?
-"I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.

294
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,139
"The King in the North."

295
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
-I told you we needed allies.
-You didn't tell me

296
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,061
you were going to abandon your crown.

297
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:56,941
I never wanted a crown.
All I wanted was to protect the North.

298
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,902
I brought two armies home with me,

299
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,405
-two dragons.
-And a Targaryen queen.

300
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,783
Do you think we can beat
the Army of the Dead without her?

301
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,995
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

302
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,289
You wanna worry
about who holds what title,

303
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,957
I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.

304
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,210
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

305
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,096
Do you have any faith in me at all?

306
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,683
You know I do.

307
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,481
She'll be a good queen.

308
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,983
For all of us.

309
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,944
She's not her father.

310
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,244
No, she's much prettier.

311
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,879
Did you bend the knee to save the North
or because you love her?

312
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,951
So you're the man?

313
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,871
Which man am I, Your Grace?

314
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,624
The one who saved Ser Jorah
when no one else could.

315
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,460
They could, they just wouldn't.

316
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,298
I'll have to make some changes
in the Citadel when I take my throne.

317
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:49,804
-A great service merits a great reward.
-It's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

318
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,348
Well, there must be something
I could give you.

319
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,688
If it's not too much trouble,
I could use a pardon.

320
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:00,606
For what crime?

321
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,986
I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

322
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,031
And also a sword.

323
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
-From the Citadel?
-From my family.

324
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,665
It's been in House Tarly for generations.
It would've been mine anyway, eventually,

325
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,252
but my father had other ideas.

326
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,089
Not Randyll Tarly?

327
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,217
You know him?

328
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,309
I offered to let him retain his lands
and titles if he bent the knee.

329
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,646
He refused.

330
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,199
Well…

331
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,371
at least I'll be allowed home again,
now that my brother's the lord.

332
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,628
Your brother stood with your father.

333
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,940
Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me.

334
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,778
-May I…
-Of course.

335
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,614
What are you doing out here?

336
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,367
Waiting, for an old friend.

337
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,204
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

338
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,373
No, no.

339
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,419
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

340
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,465
I'm not his brother.
He trusts you more than anyone.

341
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,218
Now's the time.

342
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,297
Sam?

343
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,759
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

344
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,057
-Were you hiding from me?
-Of course not.

345
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,768
What are you doing in Winterfell?

346
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,771
Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

347
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,609
What's wrong?

348
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,570
-Gilly? Is she all right?
-She's good.

349
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,030
Little Sam?

350
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,949
Don't you know?

351
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,285
Know what?

352
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,704
Daenerys…

353
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:49,293
She executed my father and brother.
They were her prisoners.

354
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:54,924
She didn't tell you.

355
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,267
I'm so sorry.

356
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,439
We need to end this war.

357
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,526
Would you have done it?

358
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,740
-I've executed men who disobeyed me.
-You've also spared men.

359
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,576
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

360
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:23,911
I wasn't a king.

361
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,331
But you were.

362
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,418
You've always been.

363
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,004
I gave up my crown, Sam.

364
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,842
I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.

365
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,510
I'm not talking
about the King in the North.

366
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,637
I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

367
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,150
Bran and I worked it out.
I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had…

368
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,529
-whatever Bran has.
-What are you talking about?

369
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,492
Your mother

370
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,870
was Lyanna Stark.

371
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,664
And your father…

372
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,669
Your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen.

373
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,590
You've never been a bastard.

374
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,094
You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

375
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,310
I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.

376
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,323
My father was the most honorable man
I ever met.

377
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,704
-You're saying he lied to me all my life.
-No.

378
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,459
Your father… Well, Ned Stark.

379
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,587
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

380
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,548
And he did. Robert would have murdered you
if he knew.

381
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,177
You're the true king.

382
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:08,057
Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name,
Protector of the Realm, all of it.

383
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,157
-Daenerys is our queen.
-She shouldn't be.

384
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,662
-That's treason.
-It's the truth.

385
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,666
You gave up your crown
to save your people.

386
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,877
Would she do the same?

387
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:49,134
-Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
-I've always had blue eyes!

388
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,145
Did you find anyone?

389
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,972
The Umber boy.

390
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,015
It's a message.

391
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,268
From the Night King.

392
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,480
His army's between us and Winterfell.
We're on foot.

393
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,401
We rode down from Castle Black.
We can double up on the horses.

394
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,321
If the horses last,
we'll get there before the dead.

395
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,616
We just have to hope
the Night King doesn't come first.

396
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,754
Keep moving! Straight up!

397
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,592
Stay together! Don't fall behind!
