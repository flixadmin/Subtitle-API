1
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,675
I'm almost at the goal line.

2
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,556
Look, I know I've been stable
for a few months, and I'm not due

3
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,935
for another treatment quite yet,
but I appreciate you checking.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,229
Hey, got to check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,067
All right, well,
you're all good now.

6
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,110
- Really?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,072
Well, it's... It's just that...

8
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:31,865
Um...

9
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,286
Lately, I've been forgetting things.

10
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,612
For instance, there was this dinner
at my dad's and I...

11
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,124
Dad.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,294
Weren't you just upstairs?

13
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:44,378
Yeah,

14
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:49,092
and then I went to the garage
because you asked me to get the files

15
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,552
from the old Scarpola case.

16
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:52,386
Remember?

17
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,013
Um...

18
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:57,433
Yeah. I must have just...

19
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,144
Checked out or something
for a couple of minutes.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,983
And then I have this hazy memory
of... of a train station,

21
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,068
and for some reason, I feel
like you were there.

22
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,904
<i>You forget we had
an appointment in the books...</i>

23
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:14,075
<i>You're gonna start moving
in and out of timelines again.</i>

24
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,805
It's news to me 'cause I'd remember
something like that.

25
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,622
Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

26
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,875
Hey, um...

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,254
How does someone catch
a "time sickness" anyway?

28
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,590
No idea. But I intend to find out.

29
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,677
Whoa, hold up now.

30
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,139
What is it?

31
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,809
I'm picking up mutations.

32
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,187
Ones I've never seen before.

33
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:44,981
Well, that sounds bad.

34
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,568
Actually, it could mean a lot of things.

35
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,696
Might even be a side effect
of my treatments.

36
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:53,823
Tell you what, I'm going to go hit up

37
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,146
my Force sibs to see if they can
help me figure this out.

38
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,078
Well, what do I tell Barry?

39
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,372
Nothing. I don't know what this is yet.

40
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,541
So for now, just chill.

41
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,459
Trust me.

42
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:10,006
All right? As soon as I find out
what's up, I'll come find you.

43
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,591
Wherever you are.

44
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,410
This case gives dead ends a bad name.

45
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:41,579
At least no one else has been hurt.

46
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,663
Yet.

47
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,791
Barr, what's wrong?

48
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,878
I just can't shake the feeling
that there's something we missed.

49
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,631
Look, I'm gonna dig into the evidence
you gave me

50
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,775
from last week's crime scene.

51
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,133
All right. Thanks.

52
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,260
Hey, where's Caitlin?

53
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,821
We need all the help we can get.

54
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,098
Ever since she decided
to go all-in with Marcus,

55
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,017
it's open season
on spontaneous getaways.

56
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,729
So one minute, they're listening to show
tunes, getting all weepy on the couch,

57
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,653
and then the next, they got
last-minute tickets

58
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,525
to <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> in Metropolis.

59
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,318
Well, good for her.

60
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,821
But where does that leave us?

61
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,871
One step closer
to the truth, y'all.

62
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,158
Okay, so I stayed up all night

63
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,829
building this cold fusion
alarm module for our satellites...

64
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,252
- Chester?
- Uh...

65
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,920
You all right?

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,716
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry, uh...

67
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,093
This all-nighter's got me zoning out.

68
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:43,516
Here's the deal. So, we know that
this meta's fire powers are cryokinetic,

69
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,186
meaning that their power output
would read as extreme cold pockets.

70
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,412
So, this alarm I just finished building?

71
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,108
It's going to alert us
as soon as there's any rapid drops

72
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,068
and barometric anomalies
anywhere in the city.

73
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,196
Only downside is we won't know
where our baddie actually is

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,740
until "flames on."

75
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,616
Or someone else gets burned up.

76
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,704
No, the moment we get a hit, I'll be
fast enough to get there in time,

77
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,749
and we can end this
before anyone else gets hurt.

78
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,628
Sue Dearbon.

79
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,341
Loving the non-catsuit look.
Why the change?

80
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,218
I got restless. So, here I am.

81
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,054
Iris?

82
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,515
Hi, you good?

83
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,684
Yeah. Yeah. I'm great. Um...

84
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah. So what brings you
back to Central City?

85
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,439
Oh, well, now that Black Hole is gone

86
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,399
and my parents
are in white-collar prison,

87
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,735
I am in charge of revitalizing
the family business,

88
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,111
so I'm just here showing face

89
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,573
at all the business holdings
and reassure everyone personally

90
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,367
that things are gonna be different.
And added bonus,

91
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,369
I get to pop in on my favorite tenants.

92
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,165
Well, we are eternally grateful
for your help in expanding our office.

93
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,048
Hey, you guys are the ones
doing all the work.

94
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,796
All right.
I have got to jet to Coast City.

95
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,381
We own a string of luxury hotels
I have to go inspect.

96
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,593
- Sounds fun.
- No. No, it's boring as hell.

97
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:04,138
Yeah. But if I'm lucky, maybe I'll catch
a glimpse of the C.C.P. while I'm there.

98
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:09,393
Oh. You guys haven't heard. Apparently,
there's been multiple sightings

99
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,354
of someone walking through walls.

100
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,774
It's popping up on socials as
#CoastCityPhantom.

101
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,210
Yeah, sounds like a new meta.

102
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,196
But I wonder how they got
their powers on the west coast.

103
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,991
Actually, I have run into
quite a few metas around the world.

104
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:27,203
Turns out there's folks all over
the place with latent meta genes.

105
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,705
All it takes is the right set
of circumstances

106
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,123
for their powers to manifest.

107
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,726
Maybe that's what happened
in Coast City.

108
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,964
Yeah, giving them their first meta.
Iris, this could be a great story.

109
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,425
Yeah. You should come with me.
I would love the company.

110
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,012
You don't mind staying in posh
five-star hotel suites, do you?

111
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,265
Um, I'll go.

112
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,182
You will?

113
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,477
Yeah. Allegra can cover things
while I'm gone.

114
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:52,978
I can?

115
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,690
Yeah, don't you have a blossoming
media empire to run?

116
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,359
Well, I can run things remotely.

117
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,296
And besides, Allegra's right.
I mean, this is a huge scoop.

118
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,116
And if this story pops, it could lay the
groundwork to a west coast expansion.

119
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,450
I am sold.

120
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,536
Great! That's that. Road trip.

121
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:09,744
Oh.

122
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,037
Let's go.

123
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,622
Okay.

124
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,131
Is that a cold spot?

125
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,676
Our fire meta just turned up
at 138 South Devon Road.

126
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,266
What the hell?

127
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,563
Flash, did you find him?

128
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:37,607
Barry, what's happening?

129
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,736
I'm too late.

130
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,121
Black fire?

131
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,666
Yeah, it was like nothing
I've ever encountered.

132
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,462
And it put itself out.
How's that even possible?

133
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,756
I don't know. But I'm telling you, man.

134
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,842
I mean, it was there one second,
the next, nothing.

135
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:06,885
So, what else do we know?

136
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,847
The vic's name, Parker DeStefano.

137
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,434
She teaches classes here at the studio.

138
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,899
Hey, are you seeing this?

139
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:22,776
Look.

140
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,530
Holy <i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

141
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,994
Okay. We need a way to preserve it.

142
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,748
Maybe we could try using
the micro-catalyzed containment unit.

143
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,626
- The what?
- Ray Palmer and I designed it together

144
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,837
in collaboration with the foundation
that he named after my dad.

145
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,258
The M.C.C.U. preserves
the vaporized integrity of gases,

146
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,803
but it's back at my workshop.

147
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,804
What does it look like?

148
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,891
It's like an eight inch vacuum-sealed
borosilicate canister

149
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,434
with an ionic-fused base and cap.

150
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,020
I'll be right back.

151
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,485
Yeah, yeah, okay, that's going
to take some time to get used to.

152
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,653
Is this it?

153
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,157
Yeah, yes, yeah.

154
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,866
Okay.

155
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,879
Okay, try to determine
its molecular properties,

156
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:27,299
- then reprogram our satellite module...
- To detect whatever meta-data I find.

157
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,802
Yeah. Then match it to
a city-wide search.

158
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,804
That way, if we're lucky...

159
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,222
We can catch this murderer

160
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,807
before they kill again.

161
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,896
I triangulated the last few
Coast City Phantom sightings

162
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,440
posted to social media,

163
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,026
and all of them occurred downtown.

164
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,945
Wow. You're really pulling out
all the stops.

165
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,032
So, how's tricks?
Everything okay at work?

166
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,786
Yeah, better than ever.
I mean, CCC Media is evolving.

167
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,457
How about you and Barry? You guys
still the couple of the century?

168
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,168
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

169
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,211
Lady, it is the best thing.

170
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,295
Agreed.

171
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,841
Uh, yeah, no, Barry is leveling up

172
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,926
and firing on all cylinders
with Team Flash

173
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,347
and... Hold on.
What's with all the prying?

174
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:16,848
It's nothing.

175
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:21,145
I mean, I get it. Life's grand
and you're busy as all get-out.

176
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,982
But with all that going on,
you're still really eager

177
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,778
to help this new meta become
<i>The Streak</i> part two.

178
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,464
And Allegra could have handled
this story

179
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,323
and taken some of this off your plate.

180
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,764
Is there anything you want to share?

181
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,620
Oh!

182
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,831
Oh, look at that. We got a hit.

183
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,291
Let's go.

184
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,964
Okay. Not them.

185
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,638
Could be either one.

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,700
- We should probably get closer.
- Uh-uh

187
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,768
Give it a minute.

188
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,448
Yahtzee.

189
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:22,289
Hi. I am Iris West-Allen
with the Central City Citizen Media.

190
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,373
Never heard of it.

191
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,211
- Fair enough. And this is...
- Her landlord.

192
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,672
Yeah. Still not caring.

193
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,924
So, if you don't mind...

194
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,176
Okay. Well, we were hoping
that you could help us

195
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,719
with a story that we're researching.

196
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,054
Not interested.

197
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,056
It's about the Coast City Phantom.

198
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,306
You ever heard of him?

199
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,599
Or her?

200
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,206
Look, we don't want
to cause you any trouble, okay?

201
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,107
We really just want to talk to you
and see if

202
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,442
there's any way that we can help you.

203
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,027
What's your name?

204
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,654
I'm not telling you that.

205
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,864
Order for Tinya.

206
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,447
Oh. Tinya.

207
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,622
Triple espresso.
That's a lot of caffeine for a teen.

208
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,003
Okay, I'm gonna be honest. When we heard
that there was a possibility of a meta

209
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,838
- in Coast City...
- What's a meta?

210
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,673
People like you, with powers.

211
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,301
And what?
You think I'm your next headline?

212
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,303
No, no, it's not like that.

213
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,640
It's just in Central City,
we have experience working with metas.

214
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,892
To do what?

215
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,977
Well, to help others.

216
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,354
Have you heard of The Flash?

217
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,399
Okay. Well, eight years ago,

218
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,110
I was the reporter
that helped break his story.

219
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,488
And if you let me,
I can help do the same for you.

220
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,189
How'd you guys find me anyway?

221
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,661
Well, metas like you are made up
of dark matter,

222
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,748
and this app helps us find just that.

223
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,707
Really?

224
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,759
Well, good luck finding me now.

225
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,993
Yeah, that went well.

226
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,020
I've triple-checked
the <i>Who's Who</i> binder.

227
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,191
Nothing on a <i>Tales from the Crypt</i> meta
who can conjure up black fire.

228
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,628
With no chemical signatures
to program into our satellites,

229
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,986
we're still flying pretty blind.

230
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:22,451
All right. Keep working the science.
I'm gonna pay Kramer a visit.

231
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,179
Now that she's part of the team,
she needs to know

232
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,347
what we're really dealing with.

233
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,707
Plus, maybe she can help us find
a connection between all three victims.

234
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,751
Just call me if you find anything.

235
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,961
Yeah...

236
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,838
No problemo.

237
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:42,513
Just me and the scary black flame.

238
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,682
Nothing weird about that.

239
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,318
Okay. Relax, Chester P.

240
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:57,986
Relax.

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,531
You got this.

242
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,933
No, no, no, no, no...

243
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:41,946
No!

244
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,956
Hey, hey, there's fire!

245
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,375
There's fire! Help! Help me!

246
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,877
Fire! Help!

247
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,172
Chuck? Chuck.

248
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,592
It's okay. It's okay.

249
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,511
It's just us.

250
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,975
You were shouting in your sleep.
Is everything okay?

251
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:11,893
Yeah.

252
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,480
Yeah, yeah, I just...

253
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,607
It's just a bad dream.

254
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,275
Must've been a doozy.

255
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,756
Hey, are you sure that's it?

256
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,282
I can feel how frightened you still are.

257
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,868
No, no, no.

258
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,662
I'm good. I'm good. Really.
I've just been working

259
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,831
way too much lately.

260
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,878
Maybe I just need some coffee
to power up the old mental hard drive.

261
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,216
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,475
Okay, I can feel him struggling.

263
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,746
Anybody else notice that he's
been having a hard time lately?

264
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,105
Yeah, I definitely have.

265
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,273
If something's bothering him,
why wouldn't he say so?

266
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,984
I mean, he's the most
touchy-feely person I know.

267
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,028
Must be super personal, then.

268
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,988
To keep us out? Team Flash?

269
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,739
Then that's just wrong.

270
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,866
He'll talk to me.

271
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,545
Since your phone's toast, I'm
downloading Chester's dark matter app.

272
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,132
Only seven hours and nine minutes to go.

273
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,218
Okay, I really need to upgrade
my service. I can afford it.

274
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,779
No, Sue, we don't have
that kind of time.

275
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,483
I mean, Tinya can walk through walls.
I mean, she could be anywhere.

276
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,184
Well, until this downloads,
we have the rest of the day

277
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,561
to come up with a better idea.

278
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,143
And this looks like
the perfect place to strategize.

279
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,942
Okay, well, we need to narrow down
all the places that we think

280
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,569
that she might be and search them.

281
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,698
Great. And we can talk about
the real problem while we're doing it.

282
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,617
Come on, Iris.

283
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,567
What are you really doing here?

284
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,043
It's... It's far out, so...

285
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,253
Try me.

286
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,590
Last year, I started feeling...

287
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,134
weird.

288
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:11,638
And so, the Still Force
took a look at me

289
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:16,518
and discovered that I had
contracted a time sickness.

290
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:22,024
Now, what that means
and how I got it is still a mystery.

291
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:25,319
But I don't know.
Recently, I feel like...

292
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,572
I'm starting to lose time.

293
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,911
Okay. Okay. I see why you're freaking.

294
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,914
Yeah. And then this morning,
I checked in with Deon

295
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,750
and he found something
that he had never seen before.

296
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,878
And even though he told me to relax
while he looks into it,

297
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,757
I mean, I can't help but feeling
that something is really wrong.

298
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,593
And that's why you threw yourself
into this story?

299
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,803
Yeah, I needed a distraction.

300
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,848
Believe me, I understand.
I did the same thing

301
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,019
when I found out that my parents
volunteered to work for Black Hole.

302
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,398
At first, I was so mad,
I just looked the other way.

303
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,736
I mean, seriously, I did everything
to avoid facing

304
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,321
the consequences of their actions.

305
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:15,327
But I had to stop running away
and face my parents.

306
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,288
And, Iris, you have to do the same thing

307
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,917
about this fear
around this time sickness thing.

308
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:27,714
Yeah, but I mean, what if Deon
shows up tomorrow with bad news?

309
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,424
Yeah, that could happen.

310
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,635
You could also be fine.

311
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,889
Either way, you have to stop running
from the fear of the unknown.

312
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,350
It's... It's a race you can't win.

313
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,271
- What?
- Tinya.

314
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,318
What if I'm not the only one running?

315
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,641
I think I know where to find her.

316
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,589
Got enough for a second cup?

317
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,633
Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

318
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,139
I'm not going to lie.
You look more stressed now

319
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,474
than you did during
the "Trials of Gyntarri" campaign.

320
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,687
Yeah. That was a tough one.

321
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,983
Wow. Even <i>D&D</i> talk
isn't going to perk you up.

322
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,401
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,862
I'm a little out of it.

324
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:36,658
I know this new fire meta case
is pretty intense.

325
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,371
And as our resident science guru,
you're in it pretty deep,

326
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:46,043
I mean, you have to examine victims
and run tests on bodies.

327
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,252
That's a lot of pressure.

328
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,757
I guess what I'm saying is,
you're not alone.

329
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,179
I mean,
we're all in this together, right?

330
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:03,685
So, if you need to talk
about something, anything...

331
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,532
It's happening again.

332
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:18,991
How'd it get out?

333
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,201
It didn't, trust me.

334
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,484
I know you're not really here.
This is just another dream.

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No, it's not.

336
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,676
Doesn't S.T.A.R. Labs have a fire
suppression system or something?

337
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,219
This fire is cold fusion.

338
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,696
It doesn't produce carbon dioxide.

339
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,098
Our sensors wouldn't pick it up
as real fire.

340
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,852
Please, please. Not like this.

341
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,189
It's here.

342
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,496
I can't put out these flames.

343
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,124
All right, just stay behind me.

344
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,151
I don't get it. First, Chuck has a dream
about this weird fire.

345
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,194
And then, the meta
who created it attacks us.

346
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,530
And why would anyone
want to hurt Chuck anyway?

347
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,905
I don't know.

348
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,793
But we're going to
keep you safe, I promise.

349
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,286
Thanks.

350
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,389
Chester, what about
your barometric-detection thingy?

351
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,456
Why didn't it go off?

352
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,100
When I programmed the search parameters,

353
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,085
I used the default setting
that establishes a tracking grid

354
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,171
outside of S.T.A.R Labs.

355
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,090
Right. Maybe you should fix that.

356
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,717
Yeah, I just did.

357
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,022
I also double-checked to make sure
that S.T.A.R Labs was clear, too.

358
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,849
It's like this black fire meta can
appear and disappear at random.

359
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,976
Plus their fire leaves no trace.

360
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,518
Like a ghost.

361
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,358
I gotta get some air.

362
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,406
He's hurting really bad inside.

363
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,701
Can you blame him? First, two bodies
show up at O'Shaughnessy's.

364
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,078
Then the yoga instructor,
DeStefano, this morning.

365
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,973
Yeah, and now the same person
is hunting Chuck,

366
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,584
a guy who would never hurt anyone.
It doesn't make any sense.

367
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,754
If this meta can get
inside S.T.A.R. Labs undetected,

368
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,422
they could be anywhere.

369
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,222
What if they're
controlling the flames remotely?

370
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,472
The shape that we saw in the fire
had no face.

371
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,932
No identifying marks.

372
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,935
Maybe it was some kind of projection.

373
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,687
I mean, it could explain
why you haven't been able to catch them.

374
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:56,942
The killer's never actually been
at any of the crime scenes.

375
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,236
But that doesn't explain
why our black fire meta

376
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,570
is going after Chester.

377
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,604
Put S.T.A.R. Labs on lockdown.

378
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,468
Nobody, except for me gets in or out,
till we figure out what's going on.

379
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,576
Where are you going?

380
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,912
If somebody
is controlling the fire remotely,

381
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,875
I'm going to search this city
until I find them.

382
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,914
Stay on comms.

383
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,625
On it.

384
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,921
She's not here.

385
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,802
How did you get...

386
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,390
I don't know how you found me,
but I'm out of here.

387
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,311
How about you stay?

388
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,315
Right. You do know that I can
walk through walls, right?

389
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,275
Well, we have friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.

390
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,821
And when I told them that we had
a ghost meta on our hands,

391
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,948
they gave me this.

392
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,661
It's called a molecular
destabilizing matrix.

393
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,164
Apparently, all I have to do
is turn it on

394
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,875
and it destabilizes any folks like you.

395
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,793
Within a three-block radius.

396
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,837
What do you say we give it a try?

397
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,173
Yeah, I thought you two helped people.

398
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:44,633
Oh, she does.

399
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,468
Me, it depends on my mood.

400
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,971
So... Why don't you relax?

401
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,389
Let's hear Iris out.

402
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,017
Why do you even care?

403
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,279
We know that you're looking
for your mother.

404
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,689
It was your backpack, at Jitters.

405
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,486
It looked like your whole life
was jammed inside of it.

406
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,950
I started looking through Coast City's
missing persons database.

407
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,954
And that's when I found out
that you had run away from foster care.

408
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,999
And that your birth mother
worked at that Jitters.

409
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,210
And that this apartment

410
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,462
was her last known address.

411
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,131
Yeah, she's a damn good reporter.

412
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:30,428
Okay, well, then you also know that my
real mom abandoned me when I was born.

413
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,391
And hasn't tried
to contact me since. Not once.

414
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:39,187
Not to see how I'm doing
or if I even survived.

415
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,399
But I did.

416
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,485
And it's been hell recently.

417
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,654
But now that I suddenly have
these new powers,

418
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,156
I have a chance to be somebody.

419
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:56,579
So you wanted to show your mom
what you've become.

420
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,649
Yeah, because maybe she'll think
that I'm something special.

421
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,003
And take me back.

422
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:10,427
Latent meta powers,
manifested by intense emotion. Check.

423
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,639
Let us help you find her.

424
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,297
Eh, it's just a paperweight.

425
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,358
Like I said, Iris is a great reporter.

426
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,396
And if there's anyone
that can help you find your mom,

427
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,487
it's her.

428
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,198
If you'll trust me.

429
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,078
We're gonna find out
what's behind all this.

430
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,714
And you're gonna be fine.

431
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,717
I'm starting to wonder
if that's still possible.

432
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,278
We've got your back.

433
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,096
Trust me, you're more than
just a part of this team.

434
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,391
You are a part of my life,
and I'm not letting you go anytime soon.

435
00:25:58,767 --> 00:25:59,767
Got it?

436
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,398
Allegra, I...

437
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,612
Never mind.

438
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,154
It's just...

439
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,450
You're just a really good friend.

440
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:19,329
So are you. The best.

441
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,582
Which is why I gotta tell you this.

442
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,128
That person in the fire?

443
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,882
I know who it was.

444
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,511
And it wasn't some new fire meta.

445
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,348
It was a ghost.

446
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,561
You seriously think
you're being haunted?

447
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,312
For real?

448
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,653
By my father.
That's who was in the fire.

449
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,072
And I know that
because that's how he died.

450
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,782
But for some reason he's...

451
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,659
He's come back.

452
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,622
But... I was there,

453
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:06,668
and whatever it was,
it didn't have a face.

454
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,211
It was just a shape.

455
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,797
No, no, no. It was more than that.

456
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,217
I wasn't with my dad
when he died, okay?

457
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
But when that fire appeared,

458
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,221
that thing inside of it
made me feel like I was.

459
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,726
Right there on the road,
where it happened 24 years ago.

460
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,772
It's almost like
I could see the wreckage.

461
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,193
And feel the heat
from the engine burning.

462
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,949
And then I could
hear my dad shouting for help.

463
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,119
But no one came.

464
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,207
Allegra, no one came.

465
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,709
He just...
No one came. He just...

466
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:48,792
He just...

467
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,085
He died alone.

468
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,883
I don't know what you saw.

469
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,636
But that wasn't your father.

470
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,598
- It couldn't have been.
- Yes, it was! It was!

471
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,142
Chuck, you told me what happened.

472
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,727
Last year, when you met.

473
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,689
How much he loved you, what a great dad
he turned out to be. All this time.

474
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:10,772
Chester...

475
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,151
A good father

476
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,321
would not do something like this.

477
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:20,158
It had to be. Look, Allegra,
I can feel it.

478
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,995
Okay? I can feel it. Like I was
right there at the crash site.

479
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,078
I can...

480
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,961
You said, "Quincy P. Runk loved his son
more than anything else."

481
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:39,469
Which means,
whatever you felt, or thought you saw,

482
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,554
it was a lie.

483
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,098
Allegra...

484
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,395
I hated him my whole life.

485
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,149
What if this is some kind of like...

486
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,193
Some kind of

487
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,655
messed up afterlife payback?

488
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,618
No! I don't believe in ghosts.
And neither do you.

489
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,288
Which is why we have to figure out
what's really going on.

490
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,931
He's back, isn't he?

491
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,558
If so, he's gonna
have to go through me first. Let's go.

492
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,332
- What's going on?
- We're not sure yet.

493
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,733
We've got cold fires on multiple levels,
and it's spreading.

494
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,641
And they're all headed our way.

495
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,083
If it's cold fire,
how come it's getting hotter in here?

496
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,751
His flames form in a sub-zero state,

497
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,813
but they still give off
high levels of kinetic energy.

498
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,837
Which means they can still
burn the hell out of us.

499
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,801
That was a router junction.

500
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,803
They're in the walls, too.

501
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,265
He's after me. This is all my fault.

502
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:12,395
No, it's not.
Chuck, you need to concentrate.

503
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,498
Okay? We're gonna
need your help to survive this.

504
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,942
No, I can't. The fire's already burning
through our structural supports.

505
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,942
Once they're done...

506
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,779
Every volatile resource
in S.T.A.R. Labs

507
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,905
will melt down
and contaminate Central City.

508
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,032
So, what do we do?

509
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,244
Chester... I know this is hard
right now,

510
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,829
but we need your help to stop this.

511
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,582
That means we need you
to initiate a search protocol.

512
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,126
Look for anything that could create
cold-catalyzed reactions.

513
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,562
We'll buy you as much time as we can.

514
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,296
Okay, I'm on it.

515
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,426
Tracking muon-catalyzed
heat signatures, and...

516
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,113
Barry, the flames
are converging on the Speed Lab.

517
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,431
I don't know why.
But maybe there's some sort of

518
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,475
epicenter forming there, or something.

519
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,602
Let's do this.

520
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,118
- Frost...
- I'm on it.

521
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,590
- Our heat index is off the charts...
- Chester.

522
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,510
I just felt a massive wave of despair.

523
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,512
I told you, I can't do this.

524
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,430
He thinks he is being haunted,

525
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,475
by his dad, and that's the reason
all of this is happening.

526
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,191
That's not the reason. Chester!

527
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,488
The despair that I'm sensing,
it's not just from you.

528
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,199
It's like I can feel the pain

529
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,953
of thousands of people, maybe more.

530
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,165
- What the hell is this?
- Cecile?

531
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,977
All right, listen to me. You guys
need to evacuate while you still can.

532
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,503
No, we're not leaving you behind.

533
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,802
It's here.

534
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,389
All that pain and sadness.

535
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,312
All that grief.

536
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:25,402
Dad?

537
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,326
Take my hand.

538
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,250
It's time to come home, Chester.

539
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,464
I'm so sorry I couldn't save you.

540
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,134
Chuck, that's not your dad.

541
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,594
It's true.

542
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,472
Chester, all of the sadness
that I'm feeling is...

543
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,142
It's coming from that thing.

544
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,604
Allegra's right. That's not your father.

545
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,023
Chester, we belong together.

546
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,859
No... no. Chester.

547
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,237
Everything that's inside of you,
is just moving

548
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,782
from you... into it.

549
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:16,120
It's... becoming a part of it.

550
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:20,374
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

551
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,128
It's feeding on your grief.
Chester, you have to let it go.

552
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,131
I love you, son.

553
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:31,427
It's lying. No, no, that thing is lying!

554
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,054
It's lying to you, honey.

555
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,057
It wants you to stay trapped
inside of your sadness. Because it's...

556
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,105
Hungry! Chester, honey,
you have to let it go.

557
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,691
I can't. I can't.

558
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:47,860
Chuck, listen to me.

559
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,280
Think about
the last time you saw your dad.

560
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,283
And what you remember most about him.

561
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,118
That's what you have to hold on to.

562
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,623
Okay? Yeah,
'cause if your real dad was here,

563
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,168
he would be the first to say,
"Remember how much I love you."

564
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:08,089
Hold on to that, Chuck.
That's what matters.

565
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,636
Take my hand.

566
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,392
My dad.

567
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:27,483
He would never ask me
to turn my back on my life here.

568
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,867
I know he would love the life
that I've built here.

569
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,201
Yes.

570
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:41,997
No.

571
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,916
He'd freak...

572
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,295
<i>if he saw my workshop.</i>

573
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,384
<i>And he'd love that I'm working
with an actual superhero,</i>

574
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,388
<i>helping him save the world every day.</i>

575
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,601
<i>No, my dad...</i>

576
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,271
he'd be proud of his son.

577
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,774
And the man that I've become.

578
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,861
I said, "Take my hand."

579
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:13,903
No.

580
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,991
No, I'm gonna stay here.

581
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,245
For my friends, because they...

582
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:24,206
They're my real family.

583
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,792
And you're not my dad.

584
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,296
So, why don't you just go to hell!

585
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,820
Chester, the cold flames are gone.
What happened?

586
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,364
I sent him packing.

587
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,058
With a little help from my friends.

588
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:17,218
Chester, seems like
you had a pretty close call, huh?

589
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,178
You, too, Barr.

590
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,597
Yeah, thankfully,
I was able to phase myself

591
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,350
and Frost long enough
for Chester to do the rest.

592
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:25,715
Ah, it wasn't all me.

593
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,354
If it wasn't for Allegra and Cecile,
I'd be just another

594
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,648
burnt corpse right about now.

595
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:34,819
Hey, what about the other three victims?
Joe, did you find anything?

596
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:38,155
I did some digging.
Called in a few favors.

597
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,283
Uh, turns out, our first victim,
Stan Mullen,

598
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,036
recently lost
all his belongings to foreclosure.

599
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,247
Then, Donna Winters?

600
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,332
Her sister died last week.

601
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,377
Let me guess, our yoga vic
was suffering some loss, too.

602
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,755
Fiancé and childhood sweetheart
to cancer.

603
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,465
It's a grief pattern.

604
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,135
Which fits
with where I've been at, lately.

605
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,846
So, this new meta, whoever he is,

606
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,473
eats grief and sorrow to survive.

607
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,226
Yeah, that's not terrifying.

608
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:08,894
It gets scarier.

609
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,021
We thought we were looking for
a meta serial killer.

610
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,065
Someone that was
controlling the black flames,

611
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,817
like the figure I saw in the fire.

612
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,278
But the fire created that.

613
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:22,908
And when I spoke to it, it heard me,
like it could understand or something.

614
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,616
Chester is right.

615
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:29,415
With all of that sorrow that I felt
coming out of that thing,

616
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,001
I also felt other emotions.

617
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:36,130
Determination, passion, desire.

618
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:39,592
It's almost like,
whatever that thing is,

619
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,510
it's got a mind of its own.

620
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:44,430
So, we're not looking
for a separate fire meta.

621
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:48,309
No. The will to seek out victims
to kill?

622
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,145
The need to satisfy its hunger
at all costs...

623
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,189
The flames have a survival instinct.

624
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,472
Which means, the flames
aren't being used by the killer.

625
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,359
They are the killer.

626
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,613
Because they're alive.

627
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,714
We're not interrupting, are we?

628
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,758
No, no, no, it's good.

629
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,345
Just trying to
wrap my head around all this.

630
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,973
You know, every member of this team
has dealt with grief.

631
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,184
Me, with my own mom, back in Houston.

632
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:34,271
- Nash, and Esperanza.
- And Barry.

633
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,817
All that he's dealt with,
and with both of his parents.

634
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,486
That's right. But I guess,
dealing with loss is just...

635
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,405
another thing that makes us human.

636
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,827
When we help each other deal with it...

637
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,328
It's what makes us family.

638
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,748
Yeah.

639
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:05,344
So, I have some filing I need to do...
Back at my office.

640
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,720
- Right now?
- Yep.

641
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,682
You guys stay. I'll see you tomorrow.

642
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,066
Hey, I know we have,
like, <i>D&D</i> plans for tonight.

643
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,944
But honestly, I just... I can't.

644
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,613
Yeah, I'll text Marco and the gang.

645
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,866
Maybe we can
pull an all-nighter this Saturday.

646
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,327
- I'd like that. A lot.
- Me, too.

647
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:32,871
And, Chuck...

648
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,126
You know I'll always be there for you,

649
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,628
- right?
- Yeah.

650
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,423
Yeah, I do.

651
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,342
And, for the record,

652
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,013
you're a very big part of my life, too.

653
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,237
<i>- How's Sue?</i>
- A life-saver, as always.

654
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,740
And, it turns out that
the Dearbon Corporation

655
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,743
owns an entire city block
in downtown Coast City.

656
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,454
- Oh, she "rich" rich.
<i>- Yeah, and you forget about it.</i>

657
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,665
Until she puts all three of us
in a place like this, and you're like,

658
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,751
"Yeah, billionaire."

659
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,210
So, Tinya is there, too?

660
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:24,882
Uh, yeah, she's sleeping
in the suite next door.

661
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,343
She has no place else to go, Barry. I...

662
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:29,219
I really wanna help her.

663
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:30,846
Yeah, that's what I love about you.

664
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,033
You make a real difference
in people's lives,

665
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:34,308
with everything you do.

666
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,684
Yeah, you, too.

667
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:41,482
Speaking of, I was thinking
that with powers like hers,

668
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,401
she could be a hero, too.

669
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,111
Like The Streak?

670
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,280
<i>I mean, why not? That worked out.</i>

671
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,867
<i>Yeah... Yeah.</i>

672
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,329
- Babe, what is it?
- No, I'm...

673
00:40:56,372 --> 00:41:00,125
I'm glad you decided
to stay in Coast City a little longer.

674
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,919
The black fires?

675
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,091
Yeah, it's just...
It's not safe here right now.

676
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:08,926
Um, okay, I mean,
is there anything that we can do?

677
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,012
No, it's okay. I mean,
we don't even know how to locate it,

678
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,389
let alone stop it,

679
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,265
If anything happened to you...

680
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,976
Yeah. No, I get it.

681
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,188
- Okay, well, I love you.
- I love you, too.

682
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,440
<i>- Get some rest, okay?</i>
- Yeah, you, too.

683
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,104
You found out what's wrong with me.

684
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,708
And it ain't good news.
