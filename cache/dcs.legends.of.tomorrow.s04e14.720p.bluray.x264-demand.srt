<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,430
What kind of egg is that?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,954
It's a dragon egg.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,920
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,599
Can't stop.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,160
I give up. You hear me, Neron?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,311
Spare Nate, and I'll let you have me.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,396
Neron?

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,437
I can make you whole again.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,590
My nipple.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,750
Gary, no.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,550
Nora, I need your help.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,279
I'm asking you to face another demon

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,714
as a member of the Time Bureau.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,950
Let's do this.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,936
All right,
enough of the sightseeing.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Can we go now?

18
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,111
I'm a bit knackered,
to be honest with you, mate.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,714
We're not here as tourists, Johnny.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,395
All right, you're gonna get rid of me
in some dramatic fashion.

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,800
Get on with it, will you?

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm not gonna kill you. Not yet anyway.

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,557
- I need you for a favor.
- Is that right?

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,837
Mmm. I need you
to open up a doorway to Hell.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,913
Oh, right, well, why didn't you say so?

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,192
I will gladly open up a vortex
right here

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,875
and give you the old heave-ho
into the great beyond.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,272
The door is not for me, Johnny.

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
It's to bring someone here
from the other side.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,910
Tabitha.

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,616
Ah, that's right. If she comes
straight through the doorway,

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,233
she doesn't need a human vessel.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,951
And what in that demented
demon brain of yours

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,509
makes you think that I'm going
to open a vortex for you, mate?

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,195
Unlike Gary,
I've still got both my nipples

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,840
so you don't have much to bargain with.

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,034
Speaking of which,
what have you done with the muppet?

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,634
Gary's just fine.

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,599
He's back at the Time Bureau
taking care of business.

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,433
Okay, Nora, you can do this.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,516
Just be normal.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,559
Hey, you can be normal
because you are normal...

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,896
Next!

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,195
Come on!

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,397
That's your ID picture?

46
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,119
They wouldn't let me retake it.

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,793
It can't be that bad. Let me see.

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,880
Uh...

49
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,601
Maybe we'll just use your photo
from the wanted poster.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,631
So, your ID's in process.

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,030
And you have me to help you
with your orientation.

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,156
All that's left is this.

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,556
What the hell is that?

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
It's your start paperwork.

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,039
No, I should be out looking for Ray.

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,456
I really need to fill all this out?

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,790
I know. I know, Nora.
But until we have a line on Neron,

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,136
there's really nothing we can do.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,994
And let's be honest, Nora,
you have a storied history here.

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,520
I need you to prove
that you can be a team player.

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,710
Have fun.

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,995
Oh, and you know what, Nora?

63
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm really, really proud of you.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,035
Welcome to the Bureau.

65
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,234
Director Sharpe.

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,476
I've been waiting for you.

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,056
Gary, I told you no playing
with my chair until after hours.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,993
Oh. Playtime's over. Shut the door.

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,589
We need to talk.

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,791
If Neron wanted John dead,
he would've killed him on the spot.

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,559
He must need something from him.

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,075
We have to find him
before he can get what he wants.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,776
And who knows what he's doing
in Ray's name,

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,190
or his perfectly grass-fed,
organic-butter body.

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,509
If Haircut's even there.

76
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,960
We don't know that Ray is gone.

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,160
Look, everybody, just breathe.
Gideon's already on it.

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
I've attuned the magicometer
to Constantine's frequency.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,554
When he uses his abilities,
I can zero in on his location.

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,915
And what do we do till then?

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,514
- Stress eat?
- Drink.

82
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,096
Yeah. How'd you lot survive until now?

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,157
Look, until we get an alert, we wait.

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,873
Right. We wait.

85
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,355
I gotta go clear my head.

86
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,536
<i>What do you think
this is about?</i>

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,631
With everything that's been going on,

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,157
I bet Director Sharpe
is about to lay down the plan of attack.

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,760
I've gathered you here because today,
we're setting time aside

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,473
to conduct performance reviews.

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,596
But this time,

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,336
I thought it would be useful if you were
assessed by one of your peers.

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,680
Agent Gary Green.

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,276
Gary?

95
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,476
Thanks, doll.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
How are my babies doing?

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,996
Let's rap for a sec.

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,753
Is Gary cool now?

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,160
That's impossible.

100
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,199
Now, I know performance reviews
can be quite a drag,

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,677
but this year's gonna be different
'cause you've got Super Agent Gary Green

102
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,831
in your corner, so no need to stress,

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,515
unless your infraction
is looking too good in that suit.

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,037
Agent Reyes
knows what I'm talking about.

105
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,430
Oh, my God, I think she just swooned.

106
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,795
This is a nightmare.

107
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,593
So I'll be meeting with agents
one-on-one,

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,433
and, uh, wait till I call your name.

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,791
Looking forward to some good face-time.

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,274
Ava, are you sure this is the best time
for performance reviews?

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,034
There's no better time to assess
the performance of our operation.

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,796
But are you sure Gary is qualified
for responsibilities?

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,351
Of course, Mona.
Gary Green is all the man we need.

114
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,475
Oh, my.
What a big, scary knife you've got.

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,075
I'd sooner be filleted
than do your bidding.

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
This knife is not for you.

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,836
It's for Raymond.

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,079
The human body is fascinating

119
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,753
and delicate and fragile.

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,120
Did you know
that if I cut this artery right here,

121
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,433
it will take only a matter of minutes
before Ray's body goes into shock

122
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,513
and eventually expires?

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,830
Hey, big man, come on,
I know you're in there.

124
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,070
Snap out of it, eh!

125
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,076
Ray's gone.

126
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,152
I've taken over his body.

127
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,670
We made a deal,
and you of all people should know

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,479
what it means to
make a deal with a demon.

129
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,917
No, if Ray was still in here,
would he do this?

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,033
I knew I could make you use your magic.

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,794
Great. Yeah. So you got me.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,833
What's that big grin all about, then?

133
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,070
Patience.

134
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,910
You'll see.

135
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,680
Huh.

136
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,833
I always took you to be more Springsteen
than "The Rite of Spring."

137
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,800
It's not for me, it's...

138
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,992
I read that classical music
is good for babies.

139
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,759
Wow. This is very, uh, impressive.

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Yeah, I found a book about dragons
in Constantine's collection.

141
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,434
"The egg must incubate under the mother
at her body temperature

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,159
lest the egg expire."

143
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,879
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit on that thing.

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,077
I figured as much.
That's why I got a heat lamp.

145
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,679
We have to do everything possible

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,036
to make sure nothing bad
happens to this egg.

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Hey...

148
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Hmm.

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,520
The egg's gonna be okay, I know it.

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,997
Wait till Ray sees that
we have a dragon.

151
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,836
- He's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,038
I've picked up an alert
with Constantine's magical signature.

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,315
That's them.

154
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,399
The signal is coming
from 1.3 million years ago.

155
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,440
That's the Ice Age.

156
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,399
He's in the part
of North America

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,392
that would come to be known
as "The Donner Pass,"

158
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,949
named after a doomed group of settlers
in the 1800s

159
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,509
who resorted to cannibalism
after their food supplies ran out.

160
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,513
There's such a thing
as too much exposition, Gideon!

161
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,274
A-ha! There they are.

162
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,194
Our heroes.

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,554
Captain Lance.

164
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,472
Thanks for coming all this way.

165
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,871
If you're looking for Ray,
he's, uh, checked out.

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,394
Is Neron on comms?

167
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
<i>But if you'd like to join him,</i>

168
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,235
I can make arrangements.

169
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,879
Sara, open fire now!

170
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,314
<i>This may be your only chance.</i>

171
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,595
We can't fire, that's Ray!

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,672
Ray made a deal with a demon. He's gone.

173
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,275
<i>We can't lose anyone else
to this bastard! Do it!</i>

174
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,396
What about you?

175
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,073
Blow us both to Kingdom come!

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,152
I'll be happy to go down for the cause.

177
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,271
- Gideon, ready the blasters.
- Yes, Captain.

178
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,032
If we kill Neron in Ray's body,
we lose Ray forever.

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,239
If you let Neron walk, then things are
gonna get much, much worse, trust me.

181
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Sara?

182
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,114
Come on, boss.

183
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,955
Something's wrong.

184
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,554
Awaiting orders, Captain.

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,196
Gideon...

186
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,675
Fire!

187
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,400
It's a trap!

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
We gotta move. They're getting away!

189
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,840
Get us out of here, Gideon!

190
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,236
That's not good!

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,549
By my calculations,

192
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,758
we're buried
beneath 357 feet of ice and snow.

193
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,513
Plus, our primary temporal delineator

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,990
has been rendered non-functional
with the extreme weather.

195
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,958
So that's it, then.
We're just snowed in?

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,350
Yeah, at the Donner Pass.

197
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,397
No one's turning me into beef jerky!

198
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,631
Everyone, calm down.
Gideon, hail the Bureau.

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,920
Should we leave a voicemail?

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,640
Ava will get the alert.
In the meantime, we wait.

201
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,274
Gideon, how long until the ice thaws?

202
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,353
The Ice Age ends
in 11,121 years.

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,671
All right, who are we eating first?
'Cause shotgun, not.

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,797
Captain, we're running
on reserve power.

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,951
I recommend disabling
all non-essential functions

206
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,599
to conserve energy for life support.

207
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,037
Do it. We need to be responsible
and conserve power.

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,111
Cut off the main generator,
the fabricator and the thermostat.

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,795
Neron is out there
with Ray and Constantine,

210
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,176
all because we fell for his trap,

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,793
because you fired on Ray!

212
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,590
And what was your plan, pretty?
Beat him to death in a snowball fight?

213
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
We were supposed to take him in,
not take him out, Mick.

214
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,279
Ray's gone.
When a team member goes dark,

215
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,670
you end them before they end you.

216
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,029
Rory, with me.

217
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,430
You made the call,
you're helping us get out of here.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,116
No problem.

219
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,314
All right.
I just assumed I'd go out alone anyway.

220
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,816
First, you kill my friends,

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,877
and now you bring me
to this miserable era.

222
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,471
Oh, Johnny, quit being such a cry baby.

223
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,075
I just did what I had to do.

224
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,833
Can't have your friends
getting in the way

225
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
of us creating that door to Hell.

226
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,873
There's still no way I'm helping you.

227
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,713
Besides, the vortexes I make
are strictly one-way. They suck you in.

228
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,518
Don't you think if my magic was powerful
enough to stabilize a vortex,

229
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,115
I wouldn't have saved Desmond or Astra?

230
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,032
Yes, and that's why we're here.

231
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,237
As powerful as your magic is,

232
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,118
you can always teach
an old dog new tricks.

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Yeah.

234
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
And it's more than magic
that you need to learn.

235
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,638
Yeah, right. So, I'm supposed

236
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,110
to learn something
off one of these yokels, am I?

237
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,715
Oh, Johnny, not from them,

238
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,870
from a king.

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,397
Hold on a minute,
that bloke's got my face.

240
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,952
That's because he's your ancestor,
King Constantine, ruler of these parts.

241
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,640
And progenitor
of your magical bloodline.

242
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,155
What kind of creature
do you think they're hunting?

243
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,039
I can't be sure,
but I'm guessing it wasn't rabbits.

244
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,634
Make way for your king.

245
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,952
Start paperwork, am I right?

246
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,158
My forms keep getting rejected
because records show

247
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,994
I am 15
and living in a mental institution.

248
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,960
I forget that we don't have
normal problems anymore.

249
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,360
Speaking of which, Ava's having Gary
do performance reviews.

250
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Okay.

251
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,671
I mean, he's not my first choice
for responsibilities,

252
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,638
- but don't we have bigger issues?
- Exactly!

253
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,951
And when I pointed that out,
Ava shut me down.

254
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,959
Not to stereotype, but I think
a clone might have replaced her

255
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
and we need to look into it.

256
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,118
- No.
- Yes.

257
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
No!

258
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,239
I just earned my freedom,

259
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,630
and I don't want to get caught
going behind Ava's back.

260
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,355
You heard what she said,
I need to focus on being a team player.

261
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,196
She said, "Gary is all the man we need."
That's not weird to you?

262
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Why is that weird?

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,398
Gary Green is all the man we need.

264
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,560
Okay. I will check on Gary,

265
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,031
and you contact the <i>Waverider</i>
and see if Sara knows anything.

266
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,473
And then,

267
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,200
we're gonna find out what form 37-C is.

268
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Okay.

269
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,269
Ah, this is useless.

270
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,033
Why don't we just blast a way off?

271
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,157
Using your heat gun
in here, Mr. Rory,

272
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,799
will deplete our low supply of oxygen.

273
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,270
Yeah, ease up, Mick.
Last time you pulled the trigger,

274
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
we ended up here.

275
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,471
You're pissed at me for firing on Erica.

276
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,616
Oh, well, it's a good thing
that this Snart bloke

277
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,472
kept a supply of jackets,
though, isn't it?

278
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,776
They smell good, too, actually.

279
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,553
What is that? Is it sandalwood?

280
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,439
Look, I'm pissed at you
because that wasn't your call to make.

281
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Someone had to make it.

282
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,398
It was our only chance
to take out Neron.

283
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,153
I made the call you should have.

284
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,431
All right, guys, come on.
Just pick away, will you?

285
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,231
No, this is good. All of a sudden,
now you care about the mission?

286
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,074
Where were you
when Neron took Ray in the first place?

287
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
Oh, you're gonna put that on me as well?

288
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,016
All right. As much
as I wanna watch you guys duke it out,

289
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,430
let's save it
for when we're not freezing to death.

290
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,749
You know what? Both of you,

291
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,395
off scamming people
at some book convention,

292
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,392
while there is a demon on our ship.

293
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,836
Hmm. Let me get this straight, Captain.

294
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,756
You're the only one that can have fun
outside of this rusted bucket of bolts.

295
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,832
All you do
is spend time with the girlfriend,

296
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,159
and nothing's ever, ever your fault.

297
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,389
You know what? You have all the answers.

298
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,875
You get us out of here.

299
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,270
Oh, when I was a boy,

300
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,671
we used to run wild
in these woods around the village.

301
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,679
Not a care in the world.

302
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,559
Now these same woods
where your children play today,

303
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
and where my hunting party

304
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,396
just encountered
another dangerous beast,

305
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,670
that threatens not just our safety,
but our entire way of life.

306
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,239
Oh, this bloke is right tedious.
Why are we here?

307
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,950
'Cause I want you to learn
that it was your ancestor that created

308
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,272
the rift between humans
and magical creatures.

309
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,392
And why would he do that?

310
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,359
Because fear is a powerful source
of energy for magic.

311
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,438
The more he exploits these creatures
to stir up fear in his people,

312
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,637
the more powerful his magic becomes.

313
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,956
I come from a long line of bastards,
but not even we would resort to that.

314
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,596
- Because your kin are always so right.
- Yes.

315
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,317
And if the king is sending
this creature to Hell,

316
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,073
then surely it deserves it.

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,318
Do you really think that
everyone in Hell deserves to be there?

318
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,870
What about Astra?

319
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,594
Or Raymond Palmer?

320
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,309
Or my Tabitha?

321
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,075
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

322
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,750
Starting with her.

323
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,999
You know, if your plan is
to guilt me into doing what you want

324
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,518
by showing me the sins of my forefather,
it ain't working, sunshine.

325
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
...but to another.

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,198
Behold! The unholy beast.

327
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,032
Hold on a minute, that's a Puca.

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
It may not look threatening,

329
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,874
but sometimes in order to see
the true nature of a creature,

330
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,912
one must draw it out.

331
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,596
No, no, no, he's got it all wrong.
They aren't evil.

332
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,696
I guess your bloodline isn't
as righteous as you think it is.

333
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,791
He's clearly misinformed.

334
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,950
Well, if you think that,

335
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,477
maybe you should go
and have a chat with the king.

336
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,115
You are truly blessed that I am here.

337
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,553
For I alone can save you
from these monsters,

338
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,951
and tonight at the rise of the low moon,

339
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,160
I will banish this creature
straight to Hell.

340
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,631
<i>Agent Powell,
please report to my office</i>

341
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,989
<i>for your performance review.</i>

342
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,835
Just need to signal the <i>Waverider.</i>

343
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,910
That's weird.

344
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,515
What are you doing in here?

345
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Uh...

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
Just thought I would check
on the timeline.

347
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,077
Yep. Looks good.

348
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,536
Do you have clearance for this?

349
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,240
Have you completed
your performance review?

350
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes. I've had my performance review.

351
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,951
And? How did it go?

352
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,833
Gary Green is all the man we need.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,878
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

354
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,198
- Nora?
- You were right. We have to talk.

355
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,109
But we can't do it here.

356
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,560
The heat lamp must have turned off
when Sara shut down the generator.

357
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,277
It's okay, Wickstable.
You're gonna be okay.

358
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,429
Wait. What did you call it?

359
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Wickstable.

360
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,629
The drawing I made of Heyworld
when I was a kid,

361
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,509
the one that inspired my dad,
the dragon in it, I named it Wickstable.

362
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,416
So I thought we could just name it that,

363
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,432
but I'm open to other ideas.

364
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,200
No, uh, I like, I like Wickstable.

365
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,597
Our little Wicksty.

366
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

367
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,256
but I think it needs
skin-to-skin contact

368
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,430
like the book said.

369
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
I think it's working.

370
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,960
Hey, uh, why does it feel like

371
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,676
we skipped past all the fun stuff into,
you know, this?

372
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,835
We can still do the fun stuff.

373
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
- What about the egg?
- Uh...

374
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,040
There's other ways we could create heat.

375
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Seriously, dude?

376
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Yeah.

377
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,917
Come on, Gideon, there's got to
be a way to boost the engines.

378
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,516
Ray would know how to read this.

379
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,318
How much longer do we have
on life support?

380
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,676
Power reserves
are at 34 hours, Captain.

381
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,355
- Hey, you got a second?
- Not now, Rory.

382
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,397
I actually came here to apologize
for blowing up before.

383
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Well, that's...

384
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Thank you.

385
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,999
- And I should've never...
- And another thing.

386
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,635
Give it up, Charlie.

387
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,240
Why were you wearing my face?

388
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,554
Were you about to apologize?

389
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,758
- Only because Charlie was catfishing me.
- All right. Shut up.

390
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
Do you think Ray would be fighting
right now?

391
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,031
No. He would be trying
to get us out of here.

392
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,398
Yeah, you're right.
He's always got a plan, it's annoying.

393
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,632
All right. Let's search Ray's quarters,
see if we can find something helpful.

394
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Thanks.

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Hmm.

396
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,256
I tried talking to Ava,

397
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
and all she'd say was,
"Gary Green is all the man we need."

398
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,232
Gary must be controlling
the Bureau somehow.

399
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,754
It's those performance reviews.

400
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,559
If we can find out how he's doing it,

401
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,831
maybe we can find a way
to snap them out of it.

402
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,230
I can try tapping into my power,
see if I can read him.

403
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,392
- If I can get to his office...
- No.

404
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,274
We're all we have left.
We can't risk losing each other.

405
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I've got it.

406
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,277
We'll tell Gary you found some security
issues in the containment cells.

407
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,990
You walk him over here, like this.

408
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,274
Then I'll close the cell doors
and you courier out, trapping him.

409
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,589
That's a great idea.

410
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,192
Yeah, just like that.

411
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,431
Okay, it works.

412
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,876
You can let me out now.

413
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm sorry I can't do that right now.

414
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,392
Sure you can. Just use the hand thing.

415
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,313
No, Mona, you need a timeout.

416
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,558
Gary Green is all the man we need.

417
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
No.

418
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,599
Go and tell the others
to prepare the ritual for tonight.

419
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,030
As you wish, my lord.

420
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,800
You're wasting your time
focusing on that monster.

421
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,312
A Puca
only reflects the person it's with.

422
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,471
It's only angry
because you scared the fur off it.

423
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,711
That creature doesn't deserve
to go to Hell.

424
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,991
I see not why I should heed
the advice of a stranger.

425
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,080
Then perhaps you will heed
the advice of your kin.

426
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,955
I know not of any kin
outside of this village,

427
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,557
and yet the similarities
in your features...

428
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,673
I am a cousin from afar
and a practitioner of magic like you.

429
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,350
If you wanna rid your village
of a real monster,

430
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,277
then I know of a demon in our midst
that we can banish together.

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
A demon?

432
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,314
In my village?

433
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,312
Well, then lead the way, my kin.

434
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,712
Put this face-stealer
with the other creature.

435
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Aye, my liege.

436
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,157
Hell shall have two more guests
by the end of the night.

437
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,030
"Cards to save the timeline.

438
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,237
A team-building card game
by Ray Palmer."

439
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Ugh.

440
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,354
I miss hating him.

441
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,999
Do you remember that night
we all met standing up on that rooftop,

442
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
and Rip told us
that we were gonna be Legends?

443
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Mmm-hmm.

444
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,190
Embarrassing.

445
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
You know what?

446
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,033
We're the last of the originals.

447
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,876
Weird.

448
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,155
Yeah, weird.

449
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,240
Legends were different back then.

450
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,074
We were different back then.

451
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,519
Look, I know that book convention
was important to you.

452
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,439
And I'm really glad that you got to go.

453
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm glad you have Ava.

454
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Thanks.

455
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,469
Guess we're growing up,

456
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,557
and hopefully not growing apart.

457
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,717
Ah. Here we are.

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,960
What is it?

459
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:07,191
"Ray Palmer's Survival Guide."

460
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Yes, it is.

461
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh.

462
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,001
Hey.

463
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,158
"What to do if you're caught
in an avalanche."

464
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,675
Oh. What does it say?

465
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,674
We've already tried all of these.

466
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,394
"If all fails,
remember you still have each other,

467
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,631
so enjoy that as long as it lasts."

468
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,040
Ah. We're dead.

469
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Yeah.

470
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Maybe.

471
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,078
Hey, it's all right, little one.

472
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I don't bite.

473
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,880
I see your talk went well.

474
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,990
I knew you'd be here.

475
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,752
So, I come from a long line
of bloody bastards. Big reveal.

476
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,550
Have you even considered what it's
really gonna be like for you in Hell?

477
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,431
With all those pissed off folks
you sent there

478
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,115
just waiting for you.

479
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,831
- Including my Tabitha.
- Tabitha...

480
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,072
Who is this bird anyway?
Why is she so important?

481
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,435
- Who is she?
- Yeah.

482
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,475
Just like your ancestor.

483
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,679
So convinced you're always right,

484
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,752
you don't even know
who you're sending away.

485
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,312
Fitting that he's
about to do the same to you.

486
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,311
But once you see how powerful
magic can be when fueled by fear,

487
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,713
then you can save yourself
from being sucked into Hell.

488
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,119
Oh, you'd love for me to stabilize
that vortex, wouldn't you?

489
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,035
You see the thing is,

490
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,597
I'm not afraid of going down.

491
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,431
I've always counted on the fact
that I'd end up there one day,

492
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,996
no matter what.

493
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,397
And what about this innocent creature
beside you?

494
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,591
Well, I guess I'm just a bloody bastard,
then, aren't I?

495
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
What's the bad news now?

496
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,035
Oh. No bad news and no more fighting.

497
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,791
Gideon, fire up the ship.

498
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,078
If I do that, life support
capacity will be reduced by half.

499
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,514
You heard me, Gideon.

500
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,399
Turn on the fabricators
and turn on the heat.

501
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,555
I'm thinking s'mores,
maybe some hot cocoa.

502
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,876
- The captain's gone mad.
- She's not mad.

503
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,190
She's right.

504
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,950
I could go for a s'more.

505
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,272
Look, Ray would want us
to have faith that we will escape.

506
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,238
He wouldn't want us cold and miserable.

507
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,836
So right now we are going to enjoy
our time together.

508
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,476
Let's go.

509
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,359
Finally. Let's get some music goin'.

510
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,191
Who's gonna bring me food
if I'm stuck in here?

511
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,517
This is how I'm gonna die, isn't it?

512
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,113
Without any books or laughter

513
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,672
in the basement
of a government building!

514
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Whoa.

515
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,311
You're right. I'm not alone.

516
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,029
I have you.

517
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,630
I'm sorry you're stuck here with me,
little one.

518
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,199
You should be out there in the woods
frolicking about.

519
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,033
Or whatever it is
you Pucas get up to these days.

520
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,435
Well, to tell you the truth,

521
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,474
I'm bloody well terrified.

522
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
No.

523
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,556
It's not the eternity of torture.

524
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,118
Or all the people
who are after my head, no.

525
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,800
It's that I'll have to watch

526
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,679
Raymond and Astra.

527
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,597
And all the others I have failed
be tortured along with me.

528
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,318
I even led the Legends to their death,

529
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,514
and you're next in line.

530
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,872
Yeah, that's right. You sense
the rottenness inside me, don't you?

531
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,431
No better than the bloody king.

532
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,397
Why would you heal a bastard like me?

533
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,194
Up with you. Time to see the king.

534
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,195
Come on, then, little one.

535
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,400
Let's go see what this party
is all about, shall we?

536
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,670
We live in a world
of wonder and amazement.

537
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,193
At times, it's beautiful, breathtaking.

538
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,590
At other times cruel, dangerous...

539
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,353
and monstrous.

540
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,550
Before you are two foul creatures
of the dark.

541
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,590
One, a grotesque woodland creature

542
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,911
that would not hesitate
to tear out your heart.

543
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,799
The other, an impostor.

544
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,718
A wielder of the dark arts
that would usurp my very body and soul.

545
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,312
Now, my people.

546
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,992
I seek your wisdom in these matters.

547
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,159
What would you have me do
with such wretched beasts?

548
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,110
To Hell. To Hell.
To Hell. To Hell.

549
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,956
To Hell. To Hell. To Hell. To Hell.

550
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,239
To Hell. To Hell. To Hell.

551
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,520
We're very excited for you to receive
your performance review.

552
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,630
But what actually happens
at the meeting?

553
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,632
Feel free to give me any spoilers.

554
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,154
Don't worry. I had my doubts, too.

555
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,792
But then I met with Gary and realized

556
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,039
Gary Green is all the man we need.

557
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,555
Gary Green is all the man we need.

558
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Bye.

559
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,713
Please step forward, Miss Wu.

560
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,439
Take a seat
and make yourself comfortable.

561
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Mint?

562
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,153
- Uh... No, thanks.
- Don't mind if I do.

563
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Let's see.

564
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Mmm.

565
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,712
I see you've made quite an impression
in your brief time here.

566
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,509
But lately, you've been slacking off.

567
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,396
It says right here,

568
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,473
you've been very disloyal
to the Time Bureau.

569
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,070
Not yet, Wolfie.

570
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,840
All right, I'll judge this round.

571
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,800
"You and your team
are stuck in a trash compactor

572
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,594
in an impromptu
and possibly fatal homage to <i>Star Wars.</i>

573
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
What do you do?"

574
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,800
Boom, that's the one.

575
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Yep.

576
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,318
Ooh. Gonna have to go with "steel up"
as Sara scales the wall.

577
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,757
- Another point for me.
- Favoritism.

578
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,600
Why would I display favoritism?

579
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
'Cause you two are obviously shagging.

580
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
- What?
- Hmm?

581
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,516
- Yeah.
- Yes, finally!

582
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
This is great. Maybe you guys
won't be so weird now.

583
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,431
Okay, I'll judge next.

584
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,714
"A teammate turns on you,
lost to the dark side.

585
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,915
What do you do?"

586
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,400
"Escape via musical number."
Not this time.

587
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,958
"Fabricate evening-wear
and infiltrate a party."

588
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,077
You guys know I love a good party sneak.

589
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,790
"Don't give up on each other.
Work together.

590
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,236
You're more than a team.
You are a family."

591
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,296
Well, I guess
that card's a winner, then.

592
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,073
Point to Charlie, I'm on the board.

593
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,435
What the hell was that?

594
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,696
Due to your reckless use
of our rapidly depleting energy,

595
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
internal temperature of the ship

596
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,919
has melted the surrounding ice
enough to shake the ship loose.

597
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,431
- What do we do?
- We work as a team.

598
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,076
Zari, engine room.
Get the thrusters back online.

599
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,958
Seal the Cargo Bay. You two with me.

600
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,911
My dear people,

601
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,515
I hear your cries and feel your anger.

602
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,471
And, therefore, by your command,

603
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,351
I send these creatures
where they belong.

604
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,116
Straight to Hell!
Straight to Hell! Straight to Hell!

605
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,760
Straight to Hell! Straight to Hell!

606
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,880
Be gone, you unclean beasts.

607
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,480
Come on, Johnny.
You know what you need to do.

608
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,393
Oh, bollocks.

609
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,000
Run. Run.

610
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,996
What have you done?

611
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,152
I've used your own magic against you.

612
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,637
We may be kin, but we are not the same.

613
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,438
You may not agree with my methods,

614
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,194
but I will always protect my people.

615
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,514
Now, the question is, Miss Wu,

616
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,678
what shall we do about your disloyalty?

617
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,950
Uh...

618
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,633
Maybe, I lose my snack room privileges
for a week.

619
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,798
Oh, no. Not my almonds.

620
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,996
Oh.

621
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,112
I wouldn't worry about your almonds,

622
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,039
because as I'm sure you've heard,

623
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,354
Gary Green is all the man you need.

624
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,152
Now, gaze into the nipple.

625
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,111
Wolfie, now!

626
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,796
What's a wolfie?

627
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,516
Wolfie?

628
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,038
Bravo. I knew you could exploit fear
to make yourself even more powerful.

629
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,757
Well, it looks like you taught
this old dog some new tricks after all.

630
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,078
But now I'm gonna use those new tricks
to strike you down.

631
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,279
You know,
I do have a few tricks of my own.

632
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,776
We're running
on very low reserve power.

633
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,256
The odds of us successfully
pushing through the avalanche above us

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,192
are 3,720 to 1.

635
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,112
Never tell me the odds, Gideon.

636
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,953
Everyone, hold on tight.

637
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,357
- Oh, this better work.
- It will.

638
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,000
- You got Wicksty?
- Yeah, I'm not letting go.

639
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,511
Come on. Come on.

640
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
- Boom!
- Whoo!

641
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Yes!

642
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,032
All systems
are back online, Captain.

643
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,389
Fantastic, Gideon.

644
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,359
Now, let's go find Constantine and Ray.

645
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,919
Damn executive privacy button. Uh...

646
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,272
Hey, can you do me a solid
and press that button, over there?

647
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,189
Do you really think
I'm letting you get out of here alive?

648
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Help!

649
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
Get away from him, you beast.

650
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,351
- What happened?
- I don't know.

651
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,960
But I'm guessing he had something
to do with it.

652
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,756
Whoa.

653
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,159
It may be too late to save Ray,

654
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,475
or Desmond, or the Legends.

655
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,916
But at least I'll get to send you back
where you belong.

656
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,559
Oh, you bastards. You did it.

657
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
You bloody survived.

658
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,791
I've never been so happy
to be wrong in my life.

659
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,993
Don't do it, John. Don't kill him.

660
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,640
Don't give up on Haircut.

661
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,920
What are you going to do, Johnny?

662
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,880
You're all out of moves.

663
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,356
No, I'm not.

664
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,639
I'll see you lovely lot in the end.

665
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,036
I'm gonna save Ray.

666
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,590
John.

667
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,155
The magicometer is picking up
strange activity on the ground.

668
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,476
Tabitha, show yourself.

669
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,516
So wonderful to be back.

670
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,395
Brimstone was so awful
for my complexion.

671
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,678
But you look ravishing, my love.

672
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,080
- Hold on. Is he kissing...
- Ugh. The Fairy Godmother.

673
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,949
Is that tongue?

674
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,510
More singing.

675
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,714
We're so screwed.

676
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,320
Come with me, my pet.

677
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,193
Let's find you a new host.

678
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,156
It's his nipple.

679
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
He tried to hypnotize Mona
with his nipple.

680
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,360
His nipple.

681
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,235
Neron gave you back your nipple,
which became bad in Hell.

682
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,596
Which is now poisoning your mind
and making you evil,

683
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,672
and that's why you came back
to the Time Bureau.

684
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,719
So that you could nip-notize everyone
and Neron could take over.

685
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Yeah.

686
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,354
You will do no more harm
with your nipple.

687
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,320
No, no! No, please. No!

688
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

689
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,634
It wasn't me, it was my nipple.

690
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
I swear.

691
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Save me.

692
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,755
As you wish.

693
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,796
You have to go.
Tell the Legends what's going on.

694
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,037
- What about you?
- I'm not leaving Mona behind.

695
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Always knew you were a team player.

696
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,154
- Ava. You okay?
- It's a long story.

697
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,675
But Gary took over the Bureau.
He nip-notized everyone.

698
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,256
Yeah, you're gonna have to explain that.

699
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,873
The germ turned?

700
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,676
- It's not just him. It's Neron and...
- Fairy Godmother... Tabitha.

701
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,759
- She's Tabitha?
- Yeah.

702
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,036
- You missed a lot.
- And Ray is still in Hell.

703
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,880
I know he hasn't given up,
so we're not going to give up on him.

704
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,511
Now, let's do this. For Ray.

705
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,115
Bloody hell.
