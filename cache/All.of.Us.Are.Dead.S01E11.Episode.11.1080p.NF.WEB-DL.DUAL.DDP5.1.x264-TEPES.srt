1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,209
Oh, Dad.

2
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,293
You...

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,848
Let me see you.

4
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,155
Get out!

5
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,826
Damn it.

6
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,411
Not here.

7
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,455
Who are you?

8
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,998
How did you get in?

9
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,836
I heard something.

10
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,090
I thought it was in here.

11
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,343
Out of my way.

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,851
Where were you? Is it okay there?

13
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062
It's okay everywhere. I love it.

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,857
The school is heaven.

15
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,403
- Later.
- Where are you going?

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,696
You'll die if you go out.

17
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,825
Don't go out, asshole!
Do as I say.

18
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,962
Are you hungry?

19
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,381
What?

20
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,973
You...

21
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,392
hungry?

22
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,185
I'm starving.

23
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm full right now.

24
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,528
So you get to live.

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,656
Count yourself lucky.

26
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,704
What is that smell?

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,004
Why do you smell like them?

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,006
What? What do you smell?

29
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,049
Let go of me.

30
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,635
You were with Cheong-san, weren't you?

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,928
Who's that?

32
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,681
- Where is he?
- What are you talking about?

33
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,933
You wanna know?

34
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,647
Are you okay?

35
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,357
Are you hurt, On-jo?

36
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,109
What took you so long?

37
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,735
I kept waiting for you.

38
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,366
And you kids, are you okay?

39
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,371
Yeah.

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,455
Good.

41
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,127
Cheong-san.

42
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,130
Mr. Nam.

43
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,602
Okay. Are you all able to run?

44
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,562
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,690
Good.

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,403
Okay. If you go straight
through the tennis courts

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,240
and pass the construction site,
you'll hit the mountain.

48
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,842
If you cross the mountain...

49
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,302
...and get to Yangdong...

50
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,410
Mr. Nam!

51
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,332
Dad, no!

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
Kids. Run!

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,758
Shit.

54
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,805
GYMNASIUM

55
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,098
Hurry!

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,601
Come on.

57
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
Run! Go! Run!

58
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,689
To the tennis courts!

59
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,691
Hurry up!

60
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,196
Go! Go! Get in.

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Get in.

62
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,456
Get in! Get in!

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,963
Run!

64
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,257
Hey, hey, hey. Wait.

65
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,059
We can't go out there.
We can't go anywhere.

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,383
- What should we do, Dae-su?
- Damn it.

67
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,605
What do we do?

68
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,296
- Oh, shit!
- What now?

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,853
Step back.

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,772
Let's go.

71
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,234
Hurry.

72
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,572
Hurry.

73
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,242
Cheong-san...

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,368
Take On-jo with you.

75
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,620
But why?

76
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,371
Dad, where are you going?

77
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,498
Dad. Dad!

78
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,500
Dad!

79
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,545
Dad, no!

80
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,509
Dad, come back!

81
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,019
Dad, come back!

82
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
Run!

83
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,652
Get out! Get out now!

84
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,529
Get out!

85
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,868
Mr. Nam!

86
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,998
Go. Go! Get out!

87
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,375
Hurry. Go.

88
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,173
Why are you?

89
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,553
Dad?

90
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,722
On-jo, look at me.

91
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,432
Go.

92
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,520
Run! Go.

93
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,608
- Go!
- Dad.

94
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,276
Go!

95
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,113
Go!

96
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,158
On-jo! Go...

97
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,827
Run.

98
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,915
Dad...

99
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,209
Go, On-jo!

100
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,753
Run!

101
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,090
Dad!

102
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,982
CONSTRUCTION NOTICE

103
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:03,983
Hurry!

104
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,779
Stop!

105
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,282
Why, why, why?

106
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,374
Go upstairs. Go!

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,001
Hurry! To the second floor!

108
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,045
Hurry!

109
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,308
Where do we go?

110
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,730
There's no way out. It's blocked.

111
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,023
There's nothing here.

112
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,149
Go through this way!

113
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,529
- Can we go?
- Let's go out this way.

114
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,112
Get back.

115
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,203
Hurry up.

116
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,417
Shit.

117
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,593
DO YOUR WORK STEP BY STEP
HASTE CAUSES ACCIDENTS

118
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,803
Careful.

119
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,478
Stay away from the edge.

120
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,688
Uh-huh.

121
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,527
- Here. Come here.
- Quiet.

122
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,697
Don't make any noise.

123
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,420
On-jo! Go!

124
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,379
Dad!

125
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,543
It's okay.

126
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,213
Just cry.

127
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,178
<i>It's better to just die.</i>

128
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,353
<i>This virus changes
a person into a different being.</i>

129
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,147
<i>The person I loved</i>

130
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>becomes a monster.</i>

131
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,654
You can forget someone who dies...

132
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,869
but it's hard to forget someone
who has changed.

133
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,111
To think that's the very last image
of the people...

134
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,240
I loved the most.

135
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,554
Remember now?

136
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,101
I don't know anyone
named Cheong-san, you freak.

137
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:55,065
Everyone went to the assembly hall,
and I got out by myself.

138
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,567
The hall?

139
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,320
I don't know who Cheong-san is.

140
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:06,452
We went with some juniors. That's all.

141
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,039
That means the others are still there.

142
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,747
You're fucking brave.

143
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,723
You'd better run.

144
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,600
Or I'll eat you.

145
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,221
I told you to run. Why didn't you listen?

146
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,860
Damn it. Nothing is working out.

147
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,279
We keep hitting dead ends.

148
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,738
Would you just be quiet?

149
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,449
It's your fault Joon-yeong died.

150
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,159
Dae-su. Don't.

151
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,537
If you hadn't bitched at him
and just shut up,

152
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,247
he would never have jumped out there.

153
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,751
Okay. It is my fault. Happy?

154
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,503
Are you happy, asshole?

155
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,921
You give it a rest too.

156
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,464
Dae-su.

157
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,260
What does it matter who's responsible
for someone's death?

158
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,888
What does living
and dying even mean?

159
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,139
I don't know.

160
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,901
If we make it out,
will it really be living?

161
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,811
Hey, you know our friends died.

162
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,105
And our parents too.

163
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
What's the point?

164
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,943
Do you wanna die?

165
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,695
Then will you die?

166
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,323
Try being a senior.

167
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,575
Then you'll really wanna die.

168
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,243
Yeah, big deal, you're a senior.

169
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,370
You try being one.
You'll see what it's like.

170
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,996
You kids.

171
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,877
You better survive till next year
and see what it's like being seniors.

172
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,381
Survive until next year
and tell me which is harder,

173
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,799
zombies or senior year.

174
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,968
Hey.

175
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
Your father, he...

176
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,937
He saved all of our lives, you know.

177
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,899
I'll never forget what he did.

178
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,610
None of us ever will.

179
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,531
If many people remembered someone,

180
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
that person...

181
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,121
is sure to go to heaven.

182
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,875
Mm-hmm.

183
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,972
Mi-jin.

184
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,056
Let's go.

185
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,139
Where? Why?

186
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,227
Let's look for a good spot
where we can jump off.

187
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,144
We're the oldest.

188
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,646
Sure. Whatever.

189
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,481
It's not like we get any respect.

190
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,441
I'll go this way. You go that way.

191
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,946
She's so cool.

192
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,158
I'll go.

193
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,535
Stay down, kid.

194
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,869
It's okay.

195
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,957
You little...

196
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,541
Get away.

197
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,551
Oh, shit.

198
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,350
I hope no one steps up anymore.

199
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,480
Whatever ends up happening...

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,818
I hope no one sacrifices themselves.

201
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,783
It's too hard living for someone.

202
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,328
When there's nothing
you can do for them at all.

203
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,624
It's like you have
to live extra heart for them.

204
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,877
It's too selfish.

205
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,256
You can't die and...

206
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,593
if you don't have the courage to live.

207
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,847
Let's...

208
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,517
talk a little later, okay?

209
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,148
Tomorrow or the next day.
Or maybe even next week.

210
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,694
Let's eat, take a bath
and then we can talk about it.

211
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,281
That's what we agreed to do, right?

212
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,127
That side.

213
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,588
What?

214
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,591
You probably don't remember.

215
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,635
What?

216
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,719
Cheong-san, hold on.

217
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,726
Is it better like this?

218
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,728
Or like this?

219
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,109
Look close. Like this? Or like this?

220
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,569
That side is better.

221
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,821
Left.

222
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,699
What do you mean by that?

223
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,371
I'll tell you tomorrow.

224
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,881
Cheong-san.

225
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,967
ONE HEART

226
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,652
That moron became a zombie.

227
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,139
Watch as we raised the frequency to 24kHz.

228
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,406
Based on tests
that we ran previously in Hyosan,

229
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,742
they respond most at 24kHz.

230
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,930
Let's begin the briefing.

231
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,714
We plan to emit sounds using drones

232
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,050
to lure the infected
into target locations.

233
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,528
This will allow us
to maximize the resulting impact

234
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,054
with minimal explosion.

235
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,222
The targets...

236
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,225
Hyosan Intersection, the sports complex,

237
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,186
Hyosan High, Hyosan Future College.

238
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,688
A total of four.

239
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,147
Expected damage.

240
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,819
Out of 170,000 residents,
110 are in various quarantine camps.

241
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,988
Sixty thousand casualties estimated.

242
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,032
Among them,
we estimate 50,000 are infected

243
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,535
and 10,000 are uninfected or asymptomatic.

244
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,414
We'll send soldiers after the explosion
to evacuate whoever is left.

245
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,710
Play the evacuation warning nonstop
until the explosions are detonated.

246
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,485
<i>Eat him.</i>

247
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>It's okay. Eat him.</i>

248
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,165
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

249
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,758
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

250
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,410
It's okay.

251
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,747
It's not okay.

252
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,082
Yes, it is.

253
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,834
If it happens again,

254
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,961
bite me instead.

255
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,677
If you bite me, I'll end up like you.

256
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,366
I really think that
that's the only way out.

257
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,537
No. It drops into
the basement on that side,

258
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,539
and there are exposed steel bars.

259
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,290
No way we can jump.

260
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,669
That side faces the school,
so there's no point trying it.

261
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,256
The ground is filled with zombies,
we'll die if we go down.

262
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,050
There's a door on the first floor
that leads to the mountain.

263
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,760
We have to go that way.

264
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,263
But it's full of zombies in there.

265
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,564
Can't we reach the roof
if we use that and the windows?

266
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,193
If someone goes to the roof and screams,
the zombies will follow them.

267
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,572
Then I'm pretty sure it'll empty out
in there, and the rest can escape.

268
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,739
I think it can work.

269
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,823
No.

270
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,286
- If that's the only way...
- I said no.

271
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,872
Please stop sacrificing yourselves.

272
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,832
Yeah, I agree with you.

273
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,751
We said we'd all survive together.

274
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,171
Me too.

275
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,798
I feel the same.

276
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,968
I'm with you guys too.

277
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,762
Then we should just wait for now.

278
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,972
And then what?

279
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,849
Do you have a plan?

280
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,935
Maybe if it rains again,
they won't be able to hear us.

281
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,562
Who knows when it's gonna rain?

282
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,399
Don't worry. My knees are throbbing.
It's gonna rain soon.

283
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,482
You'll see.

284
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
It's way too clear.

285
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,535
Hear that?

286
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,290
What?

287
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,627
They're saying to take cover.

288
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,128
Who is?

289
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,340
This is a public announcement.

290
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,343
Explosives will be detonated
at the sports complex,

291
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,512
<i>Hyosan High School, Future College,
and Hyosan Intersection.</i>

292
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,807
If you hear this, take shelter
in subways and underground garages.

293
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,976
We need to take cover.
There will be explosions.

294
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,728
What do you mean explosions?

295
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,021
Are you sure about that?

296
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,652
Hyosan Intersection,
Future College...

297
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,530
...and also our school will be blown up.

298
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,868
Hey, are those fucking soldiers
gonna shoot missiles at us?

299
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,119
When is it gonna happen?

300
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,412
I can't really tell.

301
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,414
They're just saying to evacuate right now.

302
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,708
Shit. Where are they expect us to go, huh?

303
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,211
When are they gonna bomb
this whole place, huh?

304
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,047
<i>Initiate operation.</i>

305
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,693
Activate the sound.

306
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,759
Send in all the drones.

307
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,930
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN
CHICKEN AND BEER

308
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,896
Won't we all die if we just stay here?

309
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,648
Do they say where to flee to?

310
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,568
They say that we should hide underground.

311
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
What if they drop a nuclear bomb?

312
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,033
Korea doesn't have nukes.
What are you saying?

313
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,493
- Huh?
- Whatever.

314
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,496
They're gonna blow up our school.

315
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,749
Where are we supposed to take cover?
There's nowhere to hide.

316
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,586
Cheong-san!

317
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,630
What?

318
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,344
It's Gwi-nam.

319
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,221
That asshole never dies.

320
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,764
Who's that?

321
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,809
Maybe we heard wrong?

322
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,518
It's quiet now.

323
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,407
Here you are.

324
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,759
- What the hell?
- Cheong-san!

325
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,877
Cheong-san! No!

326
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,881
Cheong-san!

327
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,973
No.

328
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,479
Cheong-san!

329
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,820
Help! Hurry!

330
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,406
Come on. Shit.

331
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,542
- Cheong-san!
- Don't!

332
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,123
Sir, they've all arrived at the targets.

333
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,291
Execute.

334
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,335
Let me confirm the order, sir.

335
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,420
Fire now!

336
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,353
It's okay.

337
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,815
It's not what you think. It's okay.

338
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,484
Do you hear me?

339
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Don't do it.

340
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,822
You're going to be fine.

341
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,531
On-jo.

342
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,618
No one's dying.

343
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,205
Not here. Not today.

344
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,248
I just...

345
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,668
Just don't say anything.

346
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,255
Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Mm-hmm?

347
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,154
LEE CHEONG-SAN

348
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,949
You hold on to it for me.

349
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,247
And I'll hold onto this.

350
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,083
LEE CHEONG-SAN, NAM ON-JO

351
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,138
Su-hyeok, go to the first floor.

352
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,183
Cheong-san!

353
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,852
Hey!

354
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,230
All of you.

355
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,899
Come after to me!

356
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,568
Today I am...

357
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,572
...the happiest guy in this school!

358
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:18,912
Hey!

359
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,040
Hey!

360
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,297
Come on, everyone. This is it.

361
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,216
We have to go.

362
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,468
Nam-ra, let's go.

363
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,928
Come on.

364
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
Can you climb up?

365
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,897
Okay. Come down.

366
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,691
Hurry.

367
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,734
Hey!

368
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,995
Hey!

369
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,205
Hey!

370
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,668
Hey!

371
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,397
- Hurry. Hurry, hurry.
- Let's go faster. Come on.

372
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,381
Hey!

373
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,683
CAUTION, RISK OF ACCIDENT

374
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,532
Come at me now.

375
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,826
All of you!

376
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,024
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

377
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,987
Come on, come on.

378
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,822
Go, go, go.

379
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,602
You know,

380
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,063
I thought it was gonna be super fun
to kill you.

381
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,859
But not anymore.

382
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,778
I'll kill you even if it isn't fun.

383
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,530
Stop acting tough.

384
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,867
What do you think? You look cool?

385
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,244
Nobody thinks that way.

386
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,665
You're just scared
because you'll get caught

387
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,292
for killing the principal.

388
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,880
You're still a coward and a loser.

389
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,811
I have nothing to fear.

390
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,733
I'm not scared of you, either.

391
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,161
I'll gouge out your eye.

392
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,527
Run away.

393
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,159
I'll let you live if you run.

394
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,349
The Sports complex. Bombing complete.

395
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,523
Hyosan Intersection. Bombing complete.

396
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,156
Future College. Bombing complete.

397
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,640
Ah, shit.

398
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,479
Ha-ri!

399
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,606
Are you okay?

400
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,786
Commander.

401
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,339
Commander. Operation, complete.

402
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,011
Sure. Okay.

403
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,849
Send in the troops in the early morning
to take care of the rest.

404
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,018
You're in charge now, officer.

405
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,604
You want me to?

406
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,939
You'll do a good job.

407
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,818
I need a sleep.

408
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,945
I've been up for too long.

409
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,268
You're here to chat?

410
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,611
Or you came to watch?

411
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,660
I came to tell you,
Hyosan was bombed last night.

412
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,996
What was that?

413
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,001
Forty percent of the population
of Hyosan has perished.

414
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,880
You're a murderer.

415
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,634
You should be ashamed of yourself.

416
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,632
I thought about it.

417
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,936
Could anyone...

418
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,107
offered comfort to the people
of Hyosan now?

419
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,860
That is why I came to see you.

420
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,823
Please tell the people of Hyosan...

421
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,409
that I'm truly sorry.

422
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,054
JIN SEON-MOO

423
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,199
This morning,

424
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,371
I watched the final video
of Lee Byeong-chan,

425
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,748
the man who created the virus in his lab.

426
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,920
<i>He tried to save his wife and son</i>

427
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,339
<i>who had already been infected
by the virus,</i>

428
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,340
<i>but he failed.</i>

429
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,094
<i>What he did was his last resort.</i>

430
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,478
Jin-su.

431
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,691
Honey...

432
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,279
<i>Please stop!</i>

433
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,490
<i>I respect the decision he made.</i>

434
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,371
<i>Lee Byeong-chan was a father
and a husband.</i>

435
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,332
<i>I'm sure he couldn't kill anyone.</i>

436
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,920
However, I am a soldier.

437
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,922
So today,

438
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,926
I ordered the bombing
of the city of Hyosan.

439
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,263
No one else has instructed me to attack.

440
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,682
No one ordered me to do anything.

441
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,728
It was my decision and mine alone
as the martial law commander.

442
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,859
I take full responsibility.

443
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,218
WIFE

444
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,890
Hi, it's me.

445
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,391
Did you eat?

446
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,312
Look at the time.

447
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,980
How come you haven't eaten dinner yet?

448
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,732
And the kids?

449
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,568
Mm-hmm.

450
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,364
It's not a big deal
if they miss school a few times.

451
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,824
Better to stay healthy, right?

452
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,494
Yeah.

453
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,079
Well, I guess
we can just look for a tutor.

454
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,748
Mm-hmm.

455
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,667
It doesn't matter if it is expensive.

456
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,215
Okay, well. Maybe not too expensive.

457
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,550
Mm-hmm.

458
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,222
Well, honey.

459
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,642
I miss you.

460
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,603
Hmm?

461
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,689
I'm so sorry.

462
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,991
I love you.

463
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,263
WIFE: I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU
I LOVE YOU TOO

464
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,890
WIFE: WHEN CAN YOU COME HOME?

465
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:37,133
NAM ON-JO
