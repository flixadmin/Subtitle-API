1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,291
They think we're academics, not thieves.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,833
Why are you such a pessimist?

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,000
How long have you known Tatiana?

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,500
Why does it matter?
You can't time love.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,083
You have to live it.

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,333
You can't risk this entire plan
for a woman.

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,500
That's the first rule, Andrés. The first.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,666
"A job can't be tainted
by a romantic relationship."

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,583
Never.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not hard to understand.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,333
You're so sweet.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,250
No loose ends.
You're going to put your life at risk.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,250
Your life is already at risk in there.
You need to understand that.

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,458
Dying is a possibility.

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,208
- Only if there are mistakes.
- No.

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,500
No. That's the funny thing.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,583
You're hurtling towards chaos,
absolute chaos,

18
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,041
yet you insist
on maintaining control at all costs.

19
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,000
With a perfect plan,
there wouldn't be any chaos.

20
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,541
For the love of God,
of course there's chaos.

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,708
Chaos interferes in life all the time.

22
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,291
You don't need to make mistakes to
be killed. How long do I have left? Huh?

23
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,541
Three years? What mistake did I make?!

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,791
Did I make mistakes?

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:19,875
I didn't?

26
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,041
Realize

27
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,375
you can't prevent it.

28
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,708
What mistake did Dad make?

29
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,666
- He must have made a mistake.
- No, it's much simpler than that.

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,041
It's possible the police were too close.

31
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,041
Or someone saw him enter,
or his gun jammed.

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,666
Little brother, you're smart.

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
But accidents

34
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,333
are the mystery of life.

35
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,708
Which is why
how you live doesn't make sense.

36
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,791
- And how was that, Andrés?
- Without Tatiana.

37
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,791
What I mean is…

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,666
Without enjoyment.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,875
Because in the end,
that's the only thing that matters.

40
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:02,791
We're here.

41
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,791
You have to understand that, okay?
Before I…

42
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,625
Thank you very much, Joao.

43
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,125
Ah, quick question.
Where are you from, Joao?

44
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,333
From São Paulo.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,333
Brazil. How marvelous.

46
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,166
Our father loved Brazil.

47
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,166
Hmm? Our father

48
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,750
was in love with your country.

49
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,041
The parties, the magic,

50
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,708
the soccer.

51
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,375
I'm not really into soccer or party.

52
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,500
Sure, but I bet you know
soccer is played in Brazil.

53
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,166
- Beautiful.
- Exactly.

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,000
They play beautifully.
They're fearless.

55
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,208
They don't think about

56
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,833
every little thing that could go wrong.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,041
They enjoy it.

58
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,833
They dance.

59
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,541
They play while they dance.

60
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,041
That's what makes them different,
little brother.

61
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,250
The best.

62
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:02,125
During the World Cup,
I always pray a lot for our national team.

63
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,333
Thank you, Joao.

64
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,375
Have a good day.
Thanks.

65
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,125
And there you have it.

66
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,041
They enjoy it.

67
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,416
Cherish it, little brother.

68
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,208
Every step.

69
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,583
Because someday,

70
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,041
something bad's gonna happen

71
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,500
that might cost you your life

72
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,583
or something much worse.

73
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,250
And on that day, you can't begin to think

74
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:35,166
that you are to blame for something
that you could never control. Understand?

75
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,625
Your life is here.

76
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,125
Enjoy it…

77
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,791
until the party's over.

78
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,458
Tamayo, I need the emergency military now.

79
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,250
You don't have enough personnel?

80
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,916
No, we have 420-hectare of forest
and 183 houses.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,208
Farms, sheds, wells, and a perimeter that
needs to expand 20 kilometers every hour.

82
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,458
- <i>Give me the unit.</i>
- I'll talk to defense and send them.

83
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,375
Great.

84
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,916
- Suárez, let's take a look at those farms.
- I'll take care of it.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go!

86
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,625
Marseille will be here in three hours.

87
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,250
- Received.
- <i>How are you?</i>

88
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,208
Well, scared.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,500
And pissed.

90
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,041
And surrounded by chicken shit.

91
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,333
Sorry, Raquel.

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,708
<i>I'm truly sorry.</i>

93
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,125
<i>Look, I've</i>

94
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,000
lived many years and you're my first love.

95
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,166
I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to talk about this.

96
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,750
I just know that I need you in my life.

97
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,416
<i>I've cherished everything</i>
<i>that you shared with me.</i>

98
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,625
Um, cooking

99
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,458
together in our filthy boat.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,250
Um, swimming fully-clothed in the sea.

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,541
And letting me know that
Van Morrison is very good, really.

102
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,875
{\an8}<i>I like him a lot.</i>

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,625
{\an8}<i>Everything is better now</i>
<i>that I'm with you.</i>

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,958
{\an8}Because I'm in love with you.

105
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,750
{\an8}You should have told me once
that you loved me.

106
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,666
{\an8}I don't know to say this to your face.

107
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,875
{\an8}<i>And forgive me because</i>

108
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,125
{\an8}when we were arguing,

109
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,625
{\an8}I was talking as

110
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,583
{\an8}the misanthrope who doesn't enjoy life,
the Professor.

111
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,833
{\an8}<i>But as Sergio, I…</i>

112
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,166
{\an8}I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

113
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,791
{\an8}I feel so stupid.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,125
{\an8}Crying.

115
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,708
{\an8}While a chicken stares at me.

116
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,083
{\an8}They say hens are good luck.

117
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,791
{\an8}Yeah, I don't know. Because it's not
in the Chinese horoscope.

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,791
{\an8}I think I can wait three hours
after everything you said to me.

119
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,041
{\an8}Let's touch base in 15 minutes.

No, there's nothing
you haven't seen before.

143
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,291
Rio, I wanted to tell you…

144
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,166
You did what we should have done
a long time ago.

145
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
Hey. Not a long time ago.

146
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,333
We had fun together.

Even though I'm sure
you're pissed right now,

148

you haven't beat the shit out of me yet.

149
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,583
Yeah, we had our fun.

150
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,416
We had good moments.

151
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,125
But that wasn't enough.

152
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,291
We got wrapped up in all this.

153
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,166
Wrapped up in what?
What the fuck are you talking about?

154
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,833
The heist. The pressure.

155
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,125
Being millionaires.

156
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,708
Hello, Denver.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,375
- I didn't hear anything.
- Hmm?

158
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,583
- See you later.
- Where are you going?

159
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,583
- Don't go, don't go.
- What?

160
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,458
Rio, did you know
I almost hooked up with Denver?

161
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,458
Tokyo, what the fuck are you doing?

162
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,708
- Hmm? In Toledo. After the festival.
- What are you doing, Tokyo?

163
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,791
You were drunk.

164
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,750
Fine. Fine. He was drunk.

165
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,041
And you were also drunk
and so was I, okay?

166
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,208
Mm, no. Actually,
Moscow ruined everything.

167
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,333
Coming into the room…

168
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,000
What we had together was casual.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,875
Anything…

170
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,250
Anything could have happened back then.

171
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,541
Now I'm wondering the same thing as you.

172
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,583
How were we able
to stay together for so long?

173
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,208
Hmm?

174
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,250
Thank you.

175
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,083
Rio, nothing happened. Nothing.

176
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,291
<i>Love is like two people</i>
<i>on a seesaw.</i>

177
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>When one goes up, the other goes down.</i>

178
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,083
<i>The balance is always fucked.</i>

179
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,291
<i>Thanks to time, monotony…</i>

180
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,541
<i>And sometimes, because of people like me,</i>

181
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,708
<i>who only know one way</i>
<i>to get over the pain,</i>

182
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,416
<i>give a little back.</i>

183
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,708
Rio was implanted
with a microphone and GPS.

184
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,416
<i>We extracted it. No problem.</i>

185
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,208
Did you manage to get the chips placed?

186
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,041
But of course, my dear.

187
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,916
<i>They're in a little box,</i>
<i>in a symphony of dreams.</i>

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,916
<i>The police have been basking in a melody</i>
<i>of sleep for some time now.</i>

189
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,208
<i>It's time</i>
<i>to give them something more. Palermo.</i>

190
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,291
It's time for Plan Alcatraz.

191
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,458
<i>Initiate as soon as possible.</i>

192
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Plan Alcatraz?

193
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,250
<i>Sergio, what the fuck</i>
<i>is going on out there?</i>

194
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,750
Our situation

195
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,541
is extreme.

196
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,791
Lisbon and I may be faced
with pressure at some point

197
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,166
that we won't be able
to handle by ourselves.

198
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,625
We'll have the army on top of us.
The police.

199
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,458
And some things may go wrong.

200
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,666
But that's why

201
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
we have Plan Alcatraz.

202
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,833
If Lisbon and I find ourselves
in a critical situation,

203
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,791
we'll need you to create
the largest diversion possible.

204
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
The objective is
for the police to be looking

205
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,833
at two places at the same time.

206
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,541
And there's only one thing more powerful
than capturing the two of us.

207
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Capturing all of us?

208
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,083
If all of you were to escape,

209
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,833
that would be
the biggest distraction we could create.

210
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,125
This will drive them crazy.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,916
Any update?

212
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,000
Colonel.

213
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,125
The seismometers are picking up movement.

214
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,208
They could be drilling
with industrial equipment.

215
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:07,916
Bernardo!

216
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,500
You've conducted exhaustive research
on the subject.

217
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,875
Tell me. Are they capable
of escaping down there?

218
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,500
I'd say no, sir.

219
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,583
That is a very unlikely scenario.

220
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,125
Unlikely or impossible, Bernardo?

221
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,500
This is an engineering project that needs
tunnel-boring machines

222
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,083
100 meters below the ground.

223
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,166
So what?

224
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,666
These people can do anything.
Don't underestimate them.

225
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,666
They could build anything
without anyone noticing.

226
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,166
- How many of your men are down there?
- 25 men.

227
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,208
25 men? What, were there budgets cuts?

228
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,208
Fifty meters, 100.
I want a policeman in every puddle.

229
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,791
They can't take a step without
being spotted. Get it together, Bernardo.

230
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,791
Yes, sir.

231
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,125
Let's go.

232
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,708
Get me an expert
that knows every rock in this subsurface.

233
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,916
Georadars, seismologists,
engineers, whatever is necessary!

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,208
This is fucking unbelievable! Come on!

235
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
What are you doing here?

236
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,833
I was hiking. I got lost, sir.

237
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,791
I came here to rest. I'm very sorry.

238
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,833
You were resting in there
with the chickens?

239
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:30,666
Listen… I knocked on the door, sir,
but nobody came up. Please.

240
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,958
And those spurs?

241
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,666
Climbing.

242
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,250
There's no mountains here.

243
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,750
Or ice.

244
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,833
You think I'm an idiot?

245
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,083
I know who you are.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,875
Raquel Murillo.

247
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,083
Okay.

248
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,625
I'll tell you the whole truth.

249
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
- Don't do that!
- Easy.

250
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,125
- Don't aim it! Put down the gun!
- Easy.

251
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,125
What's your name?

252
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,500
- Put down the gun!
- Your name.

253
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,625
What's your name?

254
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,291
Tell me your name.

255
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,500
- Justino.
- Justino. Justino, easy.

256
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,250
Look at me. Look at me.

257
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,250
Now…

258
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,500
Now you have two guns pointing at you.

259
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,833
You only have a little shotgun
to kill birds with.

260
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,166
You can hurt me.

261
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,166
But if you shoot me, you're dead.
So lower your weapon.

262
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,791
Lower it, Justino.

263
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,750
Easy.

264
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,625
Easy. That's it.

265
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,916
You have no chance.

266
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,458
If I were you, I wouldn't risk my life.

267
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,583
They asked for help from civilians.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,125
And they're offering ten million euros
as a reward, miss.

269
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,000
You put down your guns.

270
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,500
It's okay.

271
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,833
It's okay.

272
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,458
It's okay.

273
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,500
Relax!

274
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,875
- Be careful!
- Relax!

275
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,875
Throw your weapons.

276
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,125
Back up, now!

277
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,083
Renata, back off!

278
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,000
- Quiet, Justino.
- Back off!

279
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,916
Calm down, Justino.

280
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,583
Throw your weapons.

281
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,833
I know how to play this, you don't.

282
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,291
Does it look
like we're playing here, Inspector?

283
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,583
You're a police officer.
I've seen you on TV.

284
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,541
And you won't shoot us.

285
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,666
But we can shoot you.
You're on our property.

286
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,625
Now you really need
to have good aim with both hands.

287
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,291
This shotgun is for big game,
not little birdies.

288
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,708
It'll make a big hole.

289
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,750
Drop the fucking guns now!

290
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,458
It's okay.

291
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,958
We're gonna do something. Okay?

292
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,541
- Hey!
- Hey!

293
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,083
How about we do some negotiation?

294
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,333
Wow, this is nice.

295
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,500
Really pretty.

296
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,416
Very nice.

297
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,500
It's hot in here. Look.

298
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,000
Here it is.

299
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,416
What are you doing?

300
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,833
- Nairobi! Nairobi!
- Ooh, ooh.

301
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,541
- What…?
- Now we're both single, aren't we?

302
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,458
Mm, yeah.

303
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,791
Yeah, now we can go
get some little kitties.

304
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay. What happened?

305
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,833
Nothing, girl. But, you know…

306
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,333
Love en… ends, right?

307
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,625
- It just ends.
- All right, come on. Come on.

308
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,958
Fellas!

309
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,541
- Come on, let's go.
- We all stormed in here with the cavalry.

310
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,500
- Eh?
- Tokyo!

311
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,458
- What are you doing?
- And I stepped in horse shit.

312
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,583
The oven!

313
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,708
- All right, come here.
- What?

314
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,083
You're gonna go upstairs
and drink a little coffee.

315
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,875
Then I'm gonna come and we'll talk.

316
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,000
- No. Coffee, no. I'll throw up.
- My love, then throw up.

317
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,166
- No.
- Throw up.

318
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,208
What?

319
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,583
I'm gonna take a shower.

320
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,833
- What shower? You're drunk as fuck.
- Yes.

321
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,958
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

322
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:23,666
I need to be in water
and be in the darkness.

323
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,958
- Floating!
- Relax!

324
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,583
Why don't we both go upstairs
and have a little talk.

325
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,083
- Just you and me.
- Of course.

326
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,625
Since you're in love
with the big fat guy in our gang, right?

327
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,000
But look I…

328
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:45,000
I had a really good story.
Good. When love…

329
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,416
I'm taking a shower.

330
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,041
Okay. Hey! Hey!

331
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,250
Radio!

332
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,541
Hey!

333
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,416
Denver, get your ass down here
and grab Tokyo.

334
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,958
- Giddyap, cowboy!
- Let her go, man. She's really funny.

335
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,791
Shut the fuck up, Matías.

336
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,500
If she wants to snorkel, I'll teach her.

337
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,500
Get back to work. You're on the clock.

338
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,708
Whatever, all right.

339
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

340
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,583
These ovens are set to 1,500 degrees.
We're not here to deal with drunk girls.

342
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,000
The macho alpha. Hmm?

343
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,791
You're like a big buffalo, Bogotá.

344
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,291
- Quit screwing around.
- Oh, I get it.

345
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,250
You love Nairobi.

346
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,291
Like a lady on top, huh?

347
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,208
Quit screwing around.

348
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,875
Fine. How about this one? Ready for this?

349
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:46,458
If I can't dive in the water,
let me dive in gold like Scrooge McDuck.

350
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,541
Denver, you're back?

351
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,958
Denver… here again?

352
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,250
Take her away.

353
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,291
Tokyo, what the fuck are you doing?

354
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,041
What are you doing?
You're putting us all in danger.

355
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,958
- Sorry.
- Don't fucking apologize.

356
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,833
This is total bullshit.

357
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,666
We're here because of you
and you're fucking drunk?

358
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,916
If you're not gonna help,

359
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,791
then the least you can do
is try to not get us all killed.

360
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,375
I'm pathetic.

361
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,541
It's no surprise you told me to fuck off.

362
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,833
Listen Tokyo, wait a second.
Wait a second.

363
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,041
We came here to get Rio.

364
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,750
Right? That's why we're here.

365
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,625
Not to save your relationship.

366
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,166
And you did it.

367
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,833
Because you are incredible.

368
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,791
Now it's time to move on.

369
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,208
Mm-hmm.

370
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,333
I can't move on.

371
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,208
You think you can't but…

372
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,166
But yes you can.

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,958
Repeat after me.

374
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,125
"I gonna move on

375
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,375
because I'm the fucking boss."

376
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:09,291
I…

377
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,458
What? Um… Tokyo!

378
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,791
- What was that?
- I don't know.

379
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,208
You don't know.

380
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,375
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,208
It doesn't matter. Okay?

382
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,666
- Okay.
- Doesn't matter.

383
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,000
No. I'm not here for this. Okay?

384
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,875
- No. Fine.
- Stay over there.

385
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,416
- Stay there. Please
- I won't do anything.

386
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
- I'm not doing anything.
- Okay.

387
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,208
- We're not gonna move.
- Not gonna move.

388
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,250
No, not the elevator.

389
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,541
We… We're going up. No.

390
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,166
Cut it out.

391
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,625
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Just stop it.

392
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,916
It's not funny.

393
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,541
You wanted it once.

394
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,916
Get out.

395
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,166
Get out. Right now.

396
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Motherfucker.

397
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:27,875
With Rio, they'll try to sneak in at least
one microphone and GPS tracker,

398
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,333
which we'll use to our advantage

399
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,041
in Plan Alcatraz.

400
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,750
So, they'll think we're escaping.

401
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,458
We'll allow them to hear it<i>,</i>

402
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,041
<i>which is much more powerful.</i>

403
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,250
Stop. Stop, Helsinki!

404
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,458
The seismometer stopped working.

405
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,958
<i>There's the opening.</i>

406
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:53,208
Our sense of hearing combined with
fear is the best way to cause paranoia.

407
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,291
We'll be able
to make them believe anything.

408
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,041
It's the tunnel.

409
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,083
<i>Get</i> <i>Palermo, hurry.</i>

410
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,000
A tunnel?

411
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,916
Are there tunnels that far down there?

412
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,833
No.

413
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,958
None from before.

414
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,958
There has to be something. Find it!

415
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,958
- There aren't any tunnels.
- Search for it!

416
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,791
<i>You see</i>…

417
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,583
An escape is about tension,

418
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,708
excitement, darkness.

419
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,625
It's about the echo within space.
It's the moist subsurface.

420
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,583
<i>They need to hear all of that.</i>

421
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:27,958
And they will.

422
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,708
They're in a flooded tunnel.

423
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,583
Turn up the volume.

424
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,041
There's an echo.

425
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,083
Where's Nairobi?

426
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,750
She's finishing smelting the gold.

427
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,708
Get everyone down here. We have enough.
We've gotta get out of here!

428
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,750
Sierra, can they smelt 90 tons of gold
in two days?

429
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,125
No. That's impossible.

430
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,833
Tell me, can you or can you not
to smelt 90 tons of gold in only two days?

431
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:09,000
You need at least 150 to 200 ovens.
I'd have to crunch the numbers.

432
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,208
Technically, it's possible, but…

433
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,250
Very unlikely.

434
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,791
If they did things that were likely,
they'd steal from your local bank.

435
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,583
Their ears will create so many doubts

436
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,458
they'll need confirmation
through a different sense.

437
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,583
Through sight.

438
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,166
And that's exactly when the new member
of the gang will come into play.

439
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,208
Behave yourself, Sofía. You're up.

440
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,583
Sofía.

441
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:42,541
We'll plant on Sofía the GPS tracker chip
and get her ready

442
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,958
<i>while we continue to bombard their ears</i>
<i>with aural hallucinations.</i>

443
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,833
What the hell is that?

444
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,833
- It sounds like some kind of boat engine.
- An engine?

445
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,875
Actually, it could be
an outboard motor with a…

446
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
recoil start.

447
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,333
Who gives a shit about the recoil start?
They're on the move.

448
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,916
They're fucking escaping!

449
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,458
There's only one conclusion they'll reach
and it'll be very clear.

450
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,208
And they are not gonna like it.

451
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,000
It's just like El Chapo's modus operandi.
The escape from Altiplano Prison.

452
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,250
Okay, I'm ready.

453
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,291
<i>We're all here, let's go.</i>

454
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,041
What is that?

455
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,208
They have wagons.

456
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,125
They have wagons.

457
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,333
Then comes the moment for us

458
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,291
to send them into a frenzy.

459
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,125
<i>We'll release Sofía.</i>

460
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,416
We have confirmation from the satellite.
They're moving.

461
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,916
How fast are they going?

462
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,333
18 kilometers per hour.

463
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,958
Holy… At that pace,
they'll be gone in half an hour.

464
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,291
What is it, Ángel?

465
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,500
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

466
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,125
- <i>Quickly.</i>
- Quickly, my ass.

467
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,000
They're getting the gold out
through a tunnel.

468
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,208
The national reserve is in wagons
with a fucking recoil starter.

469
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,083
The unit is staying in Madrid.

470
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,833
We'll cut the signals from the microphones
and the satellite will be all that's left.

471
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,750
So their only option
will be to watch the GPS.

472
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,500
They'll follow Sofía.

473
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,041
We've lost audio.

474
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,875
The signal is out of range.

475
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,041
They're too far down.

476
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,583
Connect me to the unit
we have underground.

477
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,000
I want a full detail done
outside the sewers.

478
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,958
Send every single unit right now!

479
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:00,750
Suárez.

480
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,750
We only have two farms left.
We're almost there.

481
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,458
Okay.

482
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,416
Gentlemen!

483
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,375
Let's move.

484
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,875
40 meters.

485
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,166
Come on, come on, come on.

486
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,375
Move.

487
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:31,708
That's right. We got 'em.
We got 'em, Bernardo. We got 'em!

488
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,625
Thirty meters.

489
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,333
They're right next to you, Bernardo.

490
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,833
You're close.

491
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,875
Come on!

492
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,625
Fifteen meters.

493
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,250
They're right around the corner from you.

494
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,041
They stopped.

495
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,166
Let's move.

496
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,000
Everyone ready. Stay sharp.

497
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,041
Five meters.

498
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:07,875
Bernardo!

499
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,041
Three meters.

500
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,083
<i>Two.</i>

501
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,666
They're here.

502
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,291
Bernardo, what's happening there?

503
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,125
- Where are they?
- Here.

504
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,541
One meter away.

505
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,833
What the fuck is this?

506
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:25,750
<i>Colonel.</i>

507
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,541
It's a ferret.

508
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,833
<i>It's dressed like a Dalí.</i>

509
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,291
Sons of bitches.

510
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,416
Sons of bitches.

511
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,833
<i>All units on alert</i>
<i>until perimeter is secured.</i>

512
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,208
It's not that bad,
if you know how to read the situation.

513
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,916
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

514
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,625
They faked an escape.

515
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:55,583
It's just an extreme maneuver
to distract us.

516
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,208
He's fucked.
He wants you to look somewhere else.

517
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,541
You stepped in shit, right?

518
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,708
But I assure you
he's on the verge of collapse.

519
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,833
It's all part of this bastards' plan.

520
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,125
Yes, but he's not
the only one who has plans.

521
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,208
This is the moment to hit them
where it hurts the most.

522
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,125
We attack.

523
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,458
We go directly for the heart.

524
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,041
We destroy them from within.

525
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,666
And I know how to do it.

526
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,083
Tell me.

527
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:40,750
It's already happening.

528
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,500
Everything.

529
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,625
<i>I have money.</i>

530
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,125
The police do as well.

531
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:51,666
Ten million.

532
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,833
Are you sure that you've heard my name
in the news?

533
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,208
- Oh yeah.
- Because…

534
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:00,208
they say that they're offering ten million
for the Professor.

535
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,750
And even that's not sure.

536
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,500
Those rewards have a lot of fine print.

537
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,708
We may be farmers,
but we are not complete idiots.

538
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,708
It was on the television, the news.
It's everywhere.

539
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,500
And I've been police,
they don't get paid, never.

540
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,375
Never. Ever.

541
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,541
Tom Lee, a man from Michigan.

542
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,166
He gave crucial information
about Bin Laden's whereabouts.

543
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,333
They offered 25 million dollars.

544
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,166
He's still trying to claim it.

545
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,625
I'm not lying. You can check the internet.

546
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,000
I can give you guys the money.

547
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:45,750
Today.

548
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,750
And much more than
the police are offering.

549
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,208
How much?

550
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,166
How does 15 million sound to you?

551
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,166
Fifteen?

552
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,541
Watch for any movement on the perimeter.

553
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,583
<i>Stay sharp, everyone.</i>

554
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,666
<i>Perimeter covered.</i>

555
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,833
The windows.
Keep your eyes on the windows.

556
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,708
<i>Copy.</i>
<i>Keeping an eye on the third floor.</i>

557
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,125
<i>Inspector?</i>

558
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,250
<i>Covered.</i>

559
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,375
Motherfucker.

560
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:49,666
Come here.

561
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,333
You're the biggest piece of shit
in the world.

562
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,958
We came here to rescue you

563
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,583
and the first thing you do
is break up with Tokyo?

564
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,541
Denver, that's a personal thing.

565
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,041
Personal my ass.
Tokyo is a bomb ready to go off.

566
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,125
You know that as well as I do.
You're gonna apologize to her.

567
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,625
Get back together.
Hell, ask her to get married.

568
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,916
I don't give a fuck,
just do what you have to do.

569
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,958
When you get out of here,
you can leave her. Not now.

570
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,000
Maybe for once
you can stop acting like a child.

571
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,083
There's a pregnant woman
coming a stuffed animal.

572
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,625
Did you guys order a circus?

573
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,041
Someone wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

574
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,416
<i>Watching left flank.</i>

575
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,458
<i>Entering maximum security perimeter.</i>

576
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,958
- <i>Lower sector?</i>
- <i>Perimeter covered.</i>

577
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,500
<i>Get the windows.</i>

578
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,833
<i>Affirmative.</i>

579
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:47,625
She's crazy.

580
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,958
We have to go outside for that bear.

581
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,166
That's exactly what we're doing, genius.

582
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,125
I'm going.

583
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,000
Nairobi!

584
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,916
- No way, Nairobi.
- What do you want?

585
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,583
We're sticking to the protocol.

586
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,000
What crawled up your ass, Nairobi?

587
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,416
Nothing.

588
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,333
Denver.

589
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,833
Choose a volunteer.

590
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,166
I got one.

591
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,250
What are you looking at?

592
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,375
Miguel.

593
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,333
Come here. Listen.

594
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,000
You're gonna go out there
and get a stuffed bear.

595
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,291
Um… But won't that be dangerous?

596
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,500
"Danger" is your middle name.
Get out there.

597
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,583
Stop it!

598
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,833
Don't do it, kid. You don't
wanna be a hero. It's not worth it.

599
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,750
If you send him out there,
it'll look like an attack.

600
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,875
It's practically suicide!

601
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,875
Listen to me, kid.
Going out there is certain death.

602
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,583
You're sending him to the slaughterhouse.
What if it's a fucking bomb?

603
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,791
If it was a bomb, I'd send you!

604
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,125
Shut up!

605
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:59,000
Hey. Hey, this is your moment.
We talked about this. Remember?

606
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,291
Listen, hey.

607
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,708
I believe in you. Remember to
stay calm and keep it together.

608
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:05,750
Just think of Amanda.

609
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,875
Let's go, come on. Come on!

610
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,041
Masks on!

611
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,041
Rio!

612
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,250
The doors are opening, sir.

613
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,958
There are ten hostages
with assault rifles.

614
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:41,083
No fucking shit, Antoñanzas!
I'm watching it too.

615
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,916
Don't shoot, I'm a hostage.

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,791
My name's Miguel Fernández Talanilla,
from Totana, Murcia. I'm a systems intern.

617
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:51,125
Keep an eye on the Dalís,
some of them might be the terrorists.

618
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,875
<i>Copy that, sir. We're alert.</i>

619
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,250
<i>Standing by for orders.</i>

620
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,125
<i>He's picking up the bear.</i>

621
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,791
The bomb is inside.

622
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,833
Mission accomplished, Mr. Denver.

623
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,125
Good job, Miguel.

624
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,250
Now, hand it to me slowly.

625
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,583
Don't make any sudden movements.
Take it to the x-ray.

626
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,541
You can send me out whenever you need,
Mr. Palermo.

627
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,291
There's a phone, but it's not a bomb.

628
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,458
And there's something else.

629
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,583
Open it, Helsinki.

630
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,250
Just a cell phone.

631
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,125
Mother fucking cock sucker.

632
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,875
What the hell do you want?

633
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,208
I can make you an offer.

634
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:41,916
Go fuck yourself!

635
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,291
Okay.

636
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,333
Where do you think you're going?
Don't be an idiot.

637
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:49,250
Get off me.

638
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,458
Can someone tell me
what the hell's going on?

639
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,166
I don't know what is going on,
but get her back here now.

640
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,750
I said now!

641
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,458
No. No.

642
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,750
"No" what?

643
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,583
- Let me.
- Stay out of this.

644
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,500
I said let me.

645
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:20,416
Between the police and the thieves,
I trust the police more.

646
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,500
These thieves have released
140 million euros in the center of Madrid.

647
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:28,791
Do you think they won't have 15 million
or 20 to give you in case you help me?

648
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,083
Yeah, yeah, but that's dirty money.

649
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,833
- The money from the police is legal.
- It's legal.

650
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,541
If you turn me in,
it will turn you into a plague.

651
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,916
As soon as they have me,
they'll disappear.

652
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,875
But guys?

653
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,916
You're gonna be on all the televisions.

654
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,333
"The couple who turned in Lisbon."
Everyone will hate you.

655
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,750
Because the whole world loves us.
Do you know why?

656
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:56,291
Because we came back to rescue
our friend who they were torturing.

657
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,041
The torturers are the same people
who are offering you ten million euros.

658
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,375
So really think about it.

659
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,083
And take the money.

660
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,875
You can have it in two hours.

661
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,875
And nobody will ever know about this.

662
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,833
I give you my word.

663
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,208
Agreed.

664
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,083
Shit.

665
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,875
The police. It's the police, Justino.

666
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,416
That's your son's, isn't it?

667
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,041
It doesn't smell like him.

668
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:11,875
Nairobi.

669
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,375
- They did this to hurt you. You know that.
- Yeah. I know.

670
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,166
And they really fucked me good…

671
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,708
…now the only thing I want

672
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,375
is to smell my son.

673
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,458
I'm a bad mom.

674
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,416
No.

675
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,250
No, Nairobi.

676
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,666
You did everything that you could.

677
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,625
And you paid for it.

678
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,458
So much. And you're still paying.

679
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,333
You have no fucking idea.

680
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,875
Do you know what I did with this bear?

681
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,791
I'm so embarrassed,
I couldn't even tell Helsinki.

682
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,041
When they used to call me
to pick up drugs,

683
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,708
I'd take my son and go to the park.

684
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,000
I'd get him dressed up.

685
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,041
And I'd sit him in his seat.

686
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,333
And I'd give him his little bear.

687
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,208
And Mama would open the bear

688
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,958
and put Molly,

689
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:20,958
cocaine,

690
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:22,958
heroin,

691
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,958
whatever I had to.

692
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,291
And that's how my son went to the park.

693
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,958
I used him

694
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:37,583
like a mule.

695
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,000
They took him away.

696
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,083
And they did it for a good reason.

697
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,750
<i>I have your son.</i>

698
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,916
What?

699
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,083
<i>Axel.</i>

700
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,250
<i>He's here with me.</i>

701
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,125
I don't believe you.

702
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,041
Yeah, yeah.

703
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:38,000
I have him here, right next to me.
Just as adorable as always.

704
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,750
<i>And he's only nine.</i>

705
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,500
- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- A chef.

706
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,500
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>A chef.</i>

707
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,458
What?

708
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,708
A chef!

709
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,625
- You wanna be a cook?
- You're lying. I'm gonna hang up.

710
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,833
Don't hang up.

711
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,750
I wanna offer you a deal.

712
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:57,166
<i>But first and foremost,</i>

713
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,250
I'll show you that I'm telling the truth.

714
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,208
I don't trust lying cunts.

715
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,666
Yeah, the feeling's mutual.

716
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:06,791
Let's go, Axel.

717
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,041
Look, let's do this.

718
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,125
I'm gonna go outside

719
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,416
with him.

720
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,666
And you'll see that I'm telling the truth.

721
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,333
Then we'll talk.

722
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,750
It's important that we trust each other.

723
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,250
- I have a clear shot.
- My baby.

724
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,291
- Fire.
- Nairobi, get back!

725
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:09,875
Nairobi. Nairobi. Stay still. Stay still.

726
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,666
- No!
- Stay still.

727
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:14,500
I need help!

728
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,375
Please! Help in here!

729
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,000
Please, hide me somewhere.

730
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,583
Please, I'm telling you. Hide me.

731
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,416
Please. Hide me somewhere, please!

732
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
Twenty million.

733
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,875
Yes, that's okay. That's okay.
I have two in my bag.

734
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,500
When I'm out, I'll give you the rest.

735
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:31,041
- I swear.
- Don't listen to her.

736
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,500
There's no time, Justino!

737
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:33,958
Hey, hands up! Hands up!

738
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:37,125
Easy. It's a radio.
I want you to hear this.

739
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,500
<i>Professor. It's Lisbon. I'm surrounded.</i>

740
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:44,875
I need to give 18 million to some people
so they can help me. Is that possible?

741
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,000
We'll deliver it to them
as soon as possible.

742
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,833
He never goes back on his word.
Neither do I. Twenty million.

743
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,458
Do you accept?

744
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,958
Sniff.

745
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,625
They have a dog.

746
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:00,375
They're gonna find her.
We will go to jail, Justino.

747
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:04,041
We have a trapdoor in the basement.
We can cover her in fertilizer.

748
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,416
- <i>The dogs won't smell anything.</i>
- There's no time!

749
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,041
- Please, Reni.
- Please!

750
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,750
No.

751
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,958
Ah… Help us, please!

752
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,375
What happened? Nairobi!

753
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:27,875
You have to hold on, please, Nairobi.

754
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,208
You have to hold on. It's gonna be okay.

755
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,583
I'm really fucked, Helsi.

756
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,875
It's okay.

757
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,708
It's inside. It's not that bad.

758
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,916
We'll take it out.

759
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,458
It's okay. Gauze! Gauze!

760
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,125
Give me the fucking gauze!

761
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,083
You're gonna be okay.

762
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,375
Now that they're playing doctor…

763
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,916
Go in with everything, right?

764
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's finally time.

765
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,500
Ladies and gentlemen, launch the attack!

766
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,916
Armored cars, advance.

767
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,208
We're gonna break down that fucking door.

768
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:20,708
Raquel.

769
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,666
Come on.

770
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,458
They're going to hide me in the basement.

771
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,083
Stop right there!

772
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,083
Raquel Murillo is in there!
She's talking to the Professor.

773
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:39,041
Move it.

774
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:44,541
What the fuck?

775
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,500
Easy, tiger.

776
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,125
- It still inside?
- Yeah.

777
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,125
- Morphine!
- They fucked me up.

778
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,458
My insides are destroyed.

779
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:53,500
No.

780
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,250
Put the weapon on the ground.
Drop your weapon.

781
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,791
Against the tree!

782
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,833
- Against the tree!
- I didn't do anything.

783
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,666
Sierra, do you copy?

784
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,625
- Talk to me.
- <i>We got Murillo.</i>

785
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:07,625
She's communicating with the Professor.
What do you wanna do?

786
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,833
- Hands up!
- No, Justino, no.

787
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:14,666
- <i>Get back!</i>
- <i>Hide me. Hide me.</i>

788
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,583
Quiet!

789
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,416
On your knees!

790
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm gonna give you morphine.
We have to take out the bullet.

791
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,083
Hold on. Hold on.

792
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,625
- Morphine!
- Stay still.

793
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,666
We have to get it out. Hold on.

794
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,416
Justino, help me.

795
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,625
I can't.

796
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,125
Velasco, Solana, with me.
The rest of you surround the structure.

797
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,083
Police!

798
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,041
I don't know what to do.

799
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,916
Guys!

800
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,000
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

801
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:51,208
The bastards are coming
with armored fucking cars! Fuck!

802
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,583
Police! Police!

803
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:01,083
Drop your weapon!
Put your hands where I can see them!

804
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,125
On your head!

805
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,125
You, get out of here.

806
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,625
Raquel.

807
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:09,458
Why are you sending him out?

808
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,291
Don't leave. Justino, don't leave!

809
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,416
She's dangerous. You need to leave.

810
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,291
- What are you gonna do?
- Suárez.

811
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:20,416
I'm turning myself in. I'm unarmed.
What are you doing?

812
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,750
Velasco, get this civilian out of here!

813
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,833
- What are you gonna do?!
- Don't leave, Justino. Don't leave!

814
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,333
What are you gonna do?!
What are you gonna do?!

815
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,250
Against the tree.

816
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,416
I said against the tree! Don't move!

817
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,375
Suárez. Suárez, I'm not a threat.

818
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,375
You're the biggest threat, traitor.

819
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,666
You sold us all out, you fucking bitch!

820
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,958
Suárez, lower your weapon.

821
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,416
Where is the Professor?

822
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:53,250
Raquel, give them my surrender.
Buy some time until I get there.

823
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,250
<i>Raquel, tell them.</i>

824
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,833
Where is the Professor?!

825
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:58,083
I don't know where the Professor is.

826
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,000
Tell them I'm almost there. Raquel.

827
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,875
Where is the Professor?!

828
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:02,958
I don't know!

829
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,916
Are you sure?

830
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,250
I'm only going to ask you one more time.

831
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,166
Get out of there!

832
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,375
<i>Get out of there!</i>

833
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,250
I don't know where the Professor is.

834
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:18,666
I don't.

835
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,166
That's the wrong answer.

836
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,875
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

837
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,916
Just get out. Just get out!

838
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,208
This was self-defense, you understand?

839
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,625
You got me, Solana?

840
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:58,750
<i>She shot first.</i>

841
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:01,916
<i>Take the gun. Clean off the prints.</i>
<i>Put it in her hand.</i>

842
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,500
Professor, it's Palermo.

843
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,416
Everyone, stand by to enter the bank.

844
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,791
After we break that goddamn door down,
we go inside immediately with all units.

845
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,958
<i>Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?</i>

846
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,666
Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?

847
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,375
<i>Sergio! Are you there?!</i>

848
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:31,416
Sergio!

849
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,458
They executed Lisbon.

850
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,166
In here, they shot Nairobi.

851
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,083
A sniper. It's very bad.

852
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,416
- Nairobi.
- Helsi.

853
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,000
Hold on.

854
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,208
I saw my son.

855
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,791
My son.

856
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,916
And he's okay. He's okay.

857
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,416
He's okay.

858
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,583
Palermo! Palermo! They're coming in
with fucking armored cars!

859
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,333
They're gonna bust down the door.

860
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,625
They're going to attack.

861
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,625
Palermo…

862
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,958
this is no longer a heist

863
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,000
or taking down the system.

864
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,291
This is a war.

865
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,166
Act accordingly.

866
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,208
Sir…

867
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,666
it's been an honor to serve with you.

868
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,583
DEFCON two!

869
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,583
Denver!

870
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,041
Positions.

871
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,791
When he turns 18,

872
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,375
you give him the money
and you tell him who his mother was.

873
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,666
- Promise me.
- Yeah.

874
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,250
Look at me. Look.

875
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,000
Give it to him yourself.

876
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:03,500
Okay?

877
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,750
You're gonna get out of here.
And out there, <i>you </i>can do it.

878
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,750
- Helsinki! DEFCON two now!
- Palermo!

879
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:16,375
Not now! I need to stay
with Nairobi, Palermo.

880
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:17,958
I'll go!

881
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:29,041
We're ready for the assault.

882
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,333
Now!

883
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,791
Attention! Get out of the way.

884
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,458
Two groups in the corners. Now!

885
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,125
On your knees holding your head!

886
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,583
Hurry up!

887
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,083
Rio, let's go.

888
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:12,000
Come on, Rio. Let's go.

889
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,250
In position.

890
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,875
Hold it.

891
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:25,541
Hold it!

892
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:32,458
Denver!

893
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,416
Fire!

894
