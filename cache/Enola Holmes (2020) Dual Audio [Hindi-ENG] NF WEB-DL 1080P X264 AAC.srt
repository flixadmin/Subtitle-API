157
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,850
<i>[Sherlock] Huh.</i>

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
<i>But it wasn't foul play.</i>

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,470
<i>How? Are you certain?</i>

160
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,930
<i>Her regular supply of drawing pencils</i>
<i>has dwindled to nothing.</i>

161
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,390
<i>She clearly had decided</i>
<i>not to replace them,</i>

162
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,100
<i>and you rarely find that kidnap victims</i>

163
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,720
<i>have planned for their own disappearance.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

164
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,020
<i>She wasn't returning,</i>

165
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,220
<i>and yet she disguised her intentions</i>
<i>perfectly.</i>

166
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,930
<i>That's good news, is it not?</i>

167
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,390
<i>Depends if you're relying on her</i>
<i>coming back.</i>

168
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,350
<i>[Mycroft] Hmm.</i>

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,770
<i>[Mycroft] Oh, good God! Feminism.</i>

170
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,600
<i>Perhaps she was mad, or senile.</i>

171
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,100
<i>Though madness, in our family?</i>
<i>I would doubt it.</i>

172
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,470
<i>-Ooh. [grunts]</i>
<i>-[Sherlock] I think I can surmise</i>

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>by the way that she left</i>
<i>leaving no clear leads,</i>

174
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
<i>she still had her full wits</i>
<i>about her. [sniffs]</i>

175
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,310
<i>No madwoman could compile the accounts</i>
<i>she sent me over the last ten years.</i>

176
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,140
<i>Perfectly clear and orderly,</i>
<i>detailing a bathroom...</i>

177
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
<i>-Which does not exist.</i>
<i>-[Mycroft] And a water closet.</i>

178
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,310
<i>Likewise.</i>

179
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,060
<i>[Mycroft]</i>
<i>And the constantly rising salaries</i>

180
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,270
<i>of the footmen, the housemaids,</i>
<i>the kitchen maids,</i>

<i>-gardeners, under gardeners...</i>
<i>-You get the point.</i>

182
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>...and for Enola, a music teacher,</i>

183
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,180
<i>a dance instructor, a governess.</i>

184
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,100
<i>Enola, you at least had a governess?</i>

185
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>She wouldn't like you in here.</i>

186
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,560
<i>This is her private space.</i>

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,220
<i>Tell me, she at least saw</i>
<i>that you had an education?</i>

188
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,390
<i>She valued education.</i>

189
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,680
<i>[scoffs]</i>

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,180
<i>She taught me herself.</i>

191
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,560
<i>She made me read every book</i>
<i>in Ferndell Hall's library.</i>

192
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
<i>Shakespeare, Locke,</i>

193
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,470
<i>and the encyclopedia,</i>

194
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,560
<i>and Thackeray, and the essays</i>
<i>of Mary Wollstonecraft.</i>

195
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,100
<i>And I did it on my own account.</i>

196
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
<i>For my own learning.</i>

197
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,680
<i>Which, Mother said, was the best way</i>
<i>to become a young...</i>

198

<i>woman.</i>

199
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,310
<i>Well, </i><span style="style2">this is what</i>
<i>she wanted you to become?</i>

200
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,850
<i>-Mycroft.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,270
<i>I don't know what she wanted me to be.</i>

202
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,770
<i>She's left me too.</i>

203
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,220
<i>[scoffs]</i>

204
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,770
<i>She will return, won't she, Sherlock?</i>

205
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,310
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

206
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,100
<i>Won't she?</i>

207
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,140
<i>[Mycroft] What is she up to, Sherlock?</i>

208
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,600
<i>She was too old to remarry, she had</i>
<i>no passions or ambitions I was aware of.</i>

209
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,810
<i>She simply had to ensure Enola</i>
<i>a decent life</i>

210
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,770
<i>and to live her remaining years</i>
<i>with dignity.</i>

211
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,270
<i>This is my house, not hers,</i>
<i>and has been since Father died.</i>

212
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,890
<i>She asked for 16 years</i>
<i>to bring up Enola here.</i>

213
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,350
<i>I gave it. And for that,</i>
<i>I deserve to be robbed?</i>

214
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,520
<i>I am not the villain here.</i>

215
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,350
<i>Perhaps she needed the money.</i>

216
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,390
<i>You clearly don't,</i>

217
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,680
<i>-or has the government cut your salary?</i>
<i>-[Mycroft sighs]</i>

218
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,140
<i>[Mycroft] It's always the same, isn't it?</i>
<i>Always the same.</i>

219
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,930
<i>We don't see each other for months,</i>
<i>and then you blast in without a care</i>

220
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,930
<i>and condemn me with your bon mots.</i>

221
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,640
<i>-Simply inquiring.</i>
<i>-You are judging.</i>

222
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,850
<i>You are judging something</i>
<i>for which you took no responsibility.</i>

223
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,930
<i>You've never shown an interest</i>
<i>in this family.</i>

224
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,600
<i>[Sherlock] I don't mean to judge.</i>

225
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,890
<i>We have two problems, as I see it.</i>

226
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,060
<i>One, finding a boarding school</i>

227
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,850
<i>that is willing to take Enola on</i>

228
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,470
<i>so she won't be a complete failure</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

229
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,350
<i>That I am in the process of solving...</i>

230
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,520
<i>with the help of an old friend.</i>

231
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,220
<i>[brakes screech]</i>

232
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,220
<i>And two, finding Mother.</i>

233
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>The first is my problem,</i>
<i>the second I consider yours.</i>

234
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
<i>My dear!</i>

235
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,310
<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-[Mycroft chuckling] My dear!</i>

236
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,020
<i>Ooh. [chuckles]</i>

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,430
<i>-[Mycroft] Let me.</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

238
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,350
<i>A motor car.</i>
<i>How delightful, Miss Harrison.</i>

239
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,060
<i>[Miss Harrison]</i>
<i>Well, I am an educator, Mr. Holmes.</i>

240
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,140
<i>I like to keep ahead of the times.</i>

241
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,020
<i>Enola </i>may prefer to stay here.</i>

242
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,100
<i>You could acquire a governess.</i>

243
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,930
<i>-She needs a firm hand, Sherlock.</i>
<i>-[Miss Harrison] </i>Where is she?</i>

244
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,970
<i>[Mycroft] She's inside,</i>

245
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,640
<i>though I must warn you in advance,</i>
<i>she's unbroken.</i>

246
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,220
<i>[Miss Harrison chuckles]</i>
<i>We'll soon see about that.</i>

247
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
<i>We need to break her and build her up.</i>

248
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
<i>-[Miss Harrison] Stand tall, girl.</i>
<i>-[door closes]</i>

249
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,890
<i>That's better.</i>

250
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,720
<i>In Mother's absence,</i>
<i>she is my ward, not yours.</i>

251
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,220
<i>-[seamstress] Waist, 24 inches.</i>
<i>-[Miss Harrison chuckles]</i>

252
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,520
<i>-[seamstress] Chest, 33 inches.</i>
<i>-Well, that's too small.</i>

253
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
<i>They are perfectly fine.</i>

254
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,140
<i>[seamstress] Hips, 35 inches.</i>

255
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,600
<i>Oh, how disappointing.</i>

256
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,470
<i>We will have to use an amplifier.</i>

257
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,390
<i>A wild and dangerous woman</i>
<i>brought up a wild child.</i>

258
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,850
<i>She seems intelligent.</i>

259
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,310
<i>Hips are simply a function of legs,</i>
<i>aren't they?</i>

260
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,270
<i>What need have they of amplification?</i>

261
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,430
<i>Aren't you the clever little tongue?</i>
<i>I'll enjoy that.</i>

262
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,970
<i>I won't enjoy being imprisoned</i>
<i>in those preposterous clothes.</i>

263
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,810
<i>These clothes will not imprison.</i>
<i>They will free.</i>

264
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,100
<i>They will allow you to fit into society,</i>
<i>to take part in its numerous pleasures.</i>

265
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,930
<i>To catch an eye, to attract.</i>

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,720
<i>With Miss Harrison's help,</i>
<i>we'll make her acceptable for society.</i>

267
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,970
<i>Father would be turning in his grave.</i>

268
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,640
<i>[Miss Harrison] </i>At my finishing school,</i>

269
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,060
<i>you will learn how to be a young lady,</i>

270
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,100
<i>and you'll make many new friends.</i>

271
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,020
<i>I don't need friends.</i>
<i>I have my own company.</i>

272
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,720
<i>[Mycroft] </i>An unedcated, underdressed,</i>

273
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,390
<i>poorly mannered wildling.</i>

274
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,930
<i>And I don't need to go</i>
<i>to your ridiculous school.</i>

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,810
<i>[Enola grunts]</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>[Enola] No! Please don't do this to me.</i>

279
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,220
<i>Let me remain happy. I am happy here.</i>

280
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,350
<i>You are a young woman now, Enola.</i>
<i>You need an education.</i>

281
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,220
<i>Test me on anything you think</i>
<i>I need to know</i>

282
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,640
<i>-to be sufficient for this world.</i>
<i>-If she taught you so well,</i>

283
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>you wouldn't be standing</i>
<i>in your undergarments in front of me.</i>

284
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,220
<i>You have no hope of making a husband</i>
<i>in your current state.</i>

285
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,810
<i>I don't want a husband!</i>

286
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,140
<i>And that is another thing</i>
<i>you need to have educated out of you.</i>

<i>[Enola whispers] Sherlock.</i>

<i>-You are his ward.</i>

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,600
<i>Make me yours.</i>

<i>-For him, I am a nuisance. For you--</i>
<i>-Enola.</i>

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,310
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

293
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,470
<i>It's out of my hands.</i>

294

<i>And if you still can't see that,</i>
<i>then shame on you both!</i>

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,970
<i>So remarkable that she left you</i>

<i>You had a pine cone wrapped in wool,</i>

<i>[Enola] Thank you.</i>

<i>That's flattering.</i>

347
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,810

<i>to bring you home.</i>

348

<i>She meant to go.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>But the truth is,</i>
<i>Mother always had a reason for everything.</i>

<i>Her own way of doing things.</i>

353

<i>And those kind of mysteries</i>
<i>are always the most satisfying to unpick.</i>

354
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,970
<i>I don't want a mystery, Sherlock.</i>

355

<i>not what you want to be there.</i>

<i>the Marquess of Basilwether.</i>

456
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,220
<i>You're a nincompoop.</i>

457
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,140
<i>I'll have you know, I have just undertaken</i>
<i>a particularly daring escape--</i>

458
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,720
<i>You have not escaped.</i>
<i>There is a man in a brown bowler hat</i>

459
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,390
<i>currently on this train searching for you,</i>
<i>and once he finds you,</i>

460
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,310
<i>he will think I helped hide you,</i>
<i>and I will be endangered by this.</i>

461
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,890
<i>Therefore, I ask you</i>
<i>to get out of this carriage.</i>

462
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,470
<i>You remind me of my uncle.</i>

463
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,100
<i>I've left him at the station.</i>

464
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,020
<i>Of course he's on the train.</i>
<i>You simply haven't looked properly.</i>

465
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,470
<i>[Tewkesbury] He's bossy too.</i>

466
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Left them all: my mother, my grandmother.</i>

467
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
<i>But I'm fine. I'm free.</i>

468
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,060
<i>Good.</i>

469
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,220
<i>Get out of the carriage, then.</i>

470
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,770
<i>A man in a brown bowler hat?</i>

<i>[breathes heavily]</i>

472
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,100
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

473
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,020
<i>[breathes deeply]</i>

474
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,930
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

476

<i>-[Tewkesbury] He's coming!</i>
<i>-Of course.</i>

477
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,560
<i>-He's checking every carriage.</i>
<i>-[Enola] Wonderful.</i>

478
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,850
<i>You have to help me.</i>

479
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,770
<i>-[breathes heavily] He didn't see me.</i>
<i>-Of course he did.</i>

480
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,140
<i>Therefore, I say good day to you,</i>

<i>Viscount Tewkesbury,</i>
<i>Marquess of Basilwether.</i>

<i>As she is.</i>

<i>A matter of great bitterness for him</i>

<i>[Tewkesbury] Phase what?</i>

<i>I'm sorry, but I've heard enough.</i>

<i>You do not know Sherlock Holmes.</i>

1061
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,100
<i>Oh, Lestrade. So pleased you could make</i>
<i>this young lady's acquaintance.</i>

1062
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,100
<i>I am Lestrade of Scotland Yard,</i>

00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,770
<i>So you claim.</i>

1065
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,430
<i>-He's never mentioned him.</i>
<i>-And you are not his assistant.</i>

1066
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,180
<i>He doesn't have an assistant.</i>

1067
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,640
<i>Sherlock Holmes always works alone.</i>

1068

<i>-Impossible.</i>
<i>-Ask me three questions about him,</i>

1070
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,180
<i>and I'll ask you three, and we'll discover</i>
<i>who knows him best. Shall we?</i>

<i>I'll pay you five pounds...</i>

<i>Delightful.</i>
<i>Perhaps you could join me for tea.</i>

<i>I advise you not to... walk away.</i>

<i>And yet you walk away anyway.</i>

<i>Whatever you think you know,</i>
<i>Sherlock Holmes,</i>

<i>please be advised that if you disturb</i>

<i>You'd hurt me badly?</i>

1120

<i>I am well aware of your talents,</i>
<i>Miss Grayston.</i>

1121
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,180
<i>The question is, what you'd risk</i>

1122
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,140
<i>if I were to advise my friends </i>
<i>in the government</i>

01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,770
<i>to take a look at this place.</i>

<i>I know my brother would be delighted</i>

<i>to browse your seditious, dangerous,</i>
<i>and extremely banned bookshelves.</i>

<i>[Sherlock] You see?</i>

<i>We can both hurt each other.</i>

<i>Now, please put the teapot down.</i>
<i>In your hands, it is a mighty weapon.</i>

<i>[scoffs]</i>

1131
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,810
<i>[Sherlock] Thank you.</i>

1132
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,220
<i>Do you have any sense</i>
<i>as to where my mother is?</i>

1133
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,720
<i>How did you find me?</i>

1134
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,520
<i>Letters hidden up her chimney.</i>

1135
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,020
<i>The ash on the sole of her shoe</i>
<i>and the coal dust led me to them.</i>

1136
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,430
<i>She always said you never missed anything.</i>

1137
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,640
<i>She needs to be home.</i>
<i>She has a daughter that needs her.</i>

1138
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,270
<i>Enola seems to be surviving perfectly well</i>
<i>on her own.</i>

1139
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,560
<i>So you've seen her?</i>

1140
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,060
<i>-Is she safe?</i>
<i>-She's had company,</i>

1141
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,270
<i>a useless boy.</i>

1142
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,720
<i>But clearly,</i>
<i>she didn't feel like she needed him.</i>

1143
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,390
<i>Enola is on her own path,</i>

1144
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,720
<i>and so, for better or worse, is Eudoria.</i>

1145
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,520
<i>-Whatever mischief you two are--</i>
<i>-Mischief?!</i>

1146
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,140
<i>A poor choice of word.</i>

1147
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,810
<i>Try not to sound like your brother.</i>

1148
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,390
<i>You haven't any hope of understanding</i>
<i>any of this. You do know that?</i>

1149
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,850
<i>Educate me as to why.</i>

1150
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,890
<i>Because you don't know</i>
<i>what it is to be without power.</i>

1151
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,810
<i>Politics doesn't interest you.</i>

1152
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,310
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-Because it's fatally boring.</i>

1153
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:34,180
<i>Because you have no interest</i>
<i>in changing a world</i>

1154
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,970
<i>that suits you so well.</i>

1155
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,140
<i>-A pretty speech.</i>
<i>-[Edith] A scary one.</i>

1156
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,640
<i>You're intelligent enough to know</i>
<i>that every word of it is true.</i>

1157

<i>[Edith chuckles]</i>

1158
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,520
<i>What a family!</i>

1159
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,020
<i>A lost child, a puffed-up misanthrope,</i>

1160
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,850
<i>a revolutionary, and yourself.</i>

1161
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,270
<i>No wife, no friends,</i>

1162
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,100
<i>just a strange occupation</i>

1163

<i>obsessed with footprints and coal dust.</i>

1164

<i>You see the world so closely,</i>

1165
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,770
<i>but do you see how it's changing?</i>

<i>[breathes deeply]</i>

<i>The reform bill is just the beginning.</i>

01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:11,970
<i>If it passes.</i>

1169
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,970
<i>I have to get back to work now,</i>
<i>Mr. Holmes.</i>

1170

<i>Customers to serve.</i>

<i>Cakes to bake.</i>

<i>I'm pleased you're interested, at least.</i>

1174
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,770
<i>Eudoria thought</i>
<i>that you'd just ignore your sister,</i>

1175
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,890
<i>like the ostrich you are.</i>

1176
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,600
<i>But I suspect that she needs you.</i>

1177
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,430
<i>So everyone keeps telling me.</i>

<i>And what she knew of Sherlock...</i>

1189

<i>Oh, she knew a great deal?</i>

<i>As much as I.</i>

<i>How very exciting.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>You keep old newspapers?</i>

<i>Coded messages that need to be deciphered.</i>

<i>And why would she leave you a message?</i>

1338
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:01,970
<i>Because she left me.</i>

1339

<i>And I thought she meant</i>
<i>for me to find her,</i>

<i>but I'm not sure she did now.</i>

1341

<i>So I left her a message,</i>
<i>and I'm hopeful of a reply.</i>

<i>And what might I learn from deportment?</i>

<i>No, not yet.</i>

1532

<i>Did you find the gunpowder?</i>

<i>-[Sherlock] I shudder to think.</i>

<i>Perhaps she wants to change the world.</i>

<i>Will you stop her?</i>

1543

<i>I don't get involved in politics.</i>

<i>-Did you help Mycroft catch me?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

1546

<i>But you found out about the money.</i>
<i>You told him.</i>

1547

<i>You disappeared.</i>
<i>We had to know how far you would run.</i>

<i>I'm just a case to you, aren't I?</i>

1549
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,390
<i>A curiosity. Is that why you're here,</i>

1550
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,770
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Or possibly you're feeling guilty.</i>

1551

<i>I'm here because I care for you.</i>

1552

<i>You're being emotional.</i>

1553
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,600
<i>It's understandable, but unnecessary.</i>

1554

<i>-[Sherlock] It's an intrigue, isn't it?</i>
<i>-[Enola] Emotion?</i>

<i>The Tewkesbury case.</i>

<i>A bit more complicated</i>

<i>He jumped from the train...</i>

<i>with another boy.</i>

1559
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:28,850
<i>Were they being chased, do you think?</i>

1560

<i>How did you know that?</i>

1561
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,680
<i>I traced your departure</i>
<i>to the same station that he left from.</i>

1562
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,350
<i>Edith mentioned "a useless boy."</i>

1563

<i>And I was telegrammed</i>
<i>about a young female assistant of mine</i>

<i>who visited the Tewkesbury residence.</i>

1565

<i>Have you solved it?</i>

1566
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,060
<i>Not yet.</i>

1567
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,890
<i>The only advice I can give to you,</i>

1568
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,770
<i>one detective to another,</i>

1569
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,270
<i>sometimes you must dangle your feet</i>
<i>in the water</i>

1570
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,220
<i>in order to attract the sharks.</i>

1571
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,020
<i>So that's why you came here.</i>

<i>Shark lessons.</i>

1573

<i>No, no.</i>

1574
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,430
<i>I came here... [sighs]</i>

1575

<i>to give you this.</i>

1576

<i>I found it under her pillow.</i>

1577

<i>[Enola] Dash...</i>

<i>Sentimental, really, but she always did...</i>

01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:40,810
<i>She always found you quite extraordinary.</i>

1581

<i>As do I, Enola Holmes.</i>

1582

<i>The choice is always yours.</i>

<i>Well,</i>

1952
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,930
<i>that's unexpected.</i>

1953
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:56,890
<i>Thank you.</i>

1954
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:59,270
<i>There are three thoughts</i>
<i>that immediately occur.</i>

1955
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:02,350
<i>One is that Mother wouldn't have signed</i>
<i>"Mother," but "Chrysanthemum."</i>

1956
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:05,600
<i>And two,</i>
<i>the Royal Academy is an institution</i>

1957
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,140
<i>that has consistently neglected</i>
<i>to include women.</i>

1958
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,180
<i>Mother wouldn't have suggested it</i>
<i>as a meeting place.</i>

1959
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:14,100
<i>And my final thought</i>
<i>is that I may have revealed my hand</i>

1960
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,140
<i>in front of my brother</i>
<i>when checking the newspaper.</i>

1961
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:19,100
<i>This is Sherlock Holmes's doing.</i>

1962
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:26,140
<i>And yet, facts don't distract from hope.</i>

1963
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,890
<i>I'll pay you five pounds</i>
<i>to swap clothes with me.</i>

1964
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:35,930
<i>[Sherlock] Anything?</i>

1965
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,350
<i>[Mycroft] Nothing at all.</i>

1966
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,220
<i>She beat you once before, little brother,</i>

1967
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,520
<i>and now she may have done so again.</i>

1968
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,680
<i>Oh, I do believe she thought it me,</i>

1969
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,470
<i>but I also believe</i>
<i>that she'd be too intrigued</i>

1970
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,430
<i>not to be here all the same.</i>

1971
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,220
<i>Unfortunately, you were wrong.</i>

1972
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,270
<i>-[Mycroft chuckles]</i>
<i>-It's possible.</i>

1973
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:58,270
<i>Nevertheless, if we do find her again,</i>

1974

<i>I'd like her to be my ward.</i>

<i>I'll take care of her.</i>

1976

<i>Well... [sighs] on your head be it.</i>

1977
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:07,930
<i>I washed my hands of her.</i>

1978
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,390
<i>Very well.</i>

1979
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,140
<i>All the better.</i>

1980
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,810
<i>You are a strange fish, little brother.</i>

1981
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:19,100
<i>And you're a cantankerous one,</i>
<i>older brother.</i>

1982
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:22,390
<i>I assume you're being so delightful</i>
<i>because of the vote?</i>

<i>Passed by one.</i>

<i>the Marquess of Tewkesbury,</i>

1985
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:28,930
<i>and his vote proved decisive.</i>

1986
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:32,020
<i>Now, much as I enjoy</i>
<i>standing outside the Royal Academy--</i>

1987

<i>-He's an interesting character, you know?</i>
<i>-[Mycroft] Hmm?</i>

1988
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,720
<i>And I suspect he's rather keen</i>
<i>on young Enola.</i>

1989
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:39,520
<i>Then he should marry her.</i>
<i>Maybe it'll tame them both.</i>

1990
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,310
<i>Drink at the club to commiserate me?</i>

1991
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:45,890
<i>Yes, I'll buy you a drink, Mycroft.</i>

<i>-Good afternoon.</i>

<i>People might be watching.</i>

<i>How on earth did you find that?</i>

2005
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:49,890
<i>Sherlock did.</i>

2006
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,810
<i>I thought you had forgotten it.</i>

2007

<i>-You used to drag it around behind you--</i>

2014

<i>I wanted to tell you where I was going,</i>
