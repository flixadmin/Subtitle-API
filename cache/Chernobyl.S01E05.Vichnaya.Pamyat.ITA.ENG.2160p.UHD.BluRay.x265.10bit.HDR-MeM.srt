1
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,719
I hear they might promote Bryukhanov.

2
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:33,879
This little problem we have
with the safety test,

3
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,079
if it's completed successfully...

4
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,999
Yes, I think promotion's very likely.

5
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,919
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

6
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,119
Naturally, they'll put me in charge
once he's gone,

7
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,839
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

8
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,719
I could pick Sitnikov.

9
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,919
I would like to be considered.

10
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,758
We'll keep that in mind.

11
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,559
Viktor Petrovich, preparations
for the test have gone smoothly.

12
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:18,798
Comrade Dyatlov's been working
per my instructions,

13
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,199
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1,600 megawatts.

14
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,198
With your approval, we're ready
to continue lowering power to...

15
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,399
We have to wait.

16
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:29,959
Is, uh...

17
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,879
Are you going to ask me
if there's a problem, Nikolai?

18
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,079
You can't read a fucking face?

19
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,919
Three years,
I've tried to finish this test.

20
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:39,079
Three years.

21
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,359
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

22
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,519
He says we can't
lower power any further,

23
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,839
not for another 10 hours.

24
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,679
A grid controller?
Where does he get off...

25
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,279
It's not the grid controller's
decision, Dyatlov.

26
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,679
It's the end of the month.

27
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,079
All the productivity quotas.

28
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,758
Everyone's working overtime.
The factories need power.

29
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,518
Someone's pushing down from above.

30
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,079
Not that we'll never know who.

31
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,559
So, do we have to scrap it or what?

32
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,359
No, I don't think so.

33
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,479
If we need to wait 10 hours, we wait.

34
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:26,838
Running at half power, we're not
going to have stability issues?

35
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,438
-No, I should think...
-I'm not asking you.

36
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,639
It's safe.

37
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,439
We'll maintain at 1,600.

38
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,839
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

39
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,119
We'll proceed then.

40
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,959
I'll personally supervise the test.

41
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,398
And it will be completed.

42
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,519
Well, I'm not waiting around, then.

43
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,078
Call me when it's done.

44
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,718
How do you feel?

45
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,478
You went to the doctor yesterday.
How is your health?

46
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,599
You don't know?

47
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:36,998
From Vienna.

48
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,638
Do you read German?

49
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:44,999
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

50
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,558
Obviously, I resent the insinuation,

51
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,719
but I think it's fair to say

52
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:50,998
you made an excellent impression
at the conference.

53
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,399
Turns out, you're quite good at this.

54
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,758
At what? Lying?

55
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,678
Statecraft, Legasov. Statecraft.

56
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,238
The West is now satisfied

57
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,039
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

58
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:05,479
which it essentially was.

59
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,879
We have you to thank for that,

60
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,358
and we intend to.

61
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,479
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

62
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,598
Our highest honor.

63
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,239
They haven't even given it to me.

64
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,878
"Promotion to director
of the Kurchatov Institute."

65
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,438
I'm humbled.

66
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,879
I don't think there's anything humble
about you, Valery Alexeyevich.

67
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,759
These rewards are not yours yet.

68
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,119
First, your testimony at the trial.

69
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:40,959
Comrade Charkov,
I understand my duty to the State.

70
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,078
But you gave us assurances.

71
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,198
The reactors would be made safe.

72
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,639
It's been months.
No changes have been made.

73
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,919
-No changes even discussed.
-First, the trial.

74
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,558
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

75
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,678
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

76
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,479
After that,
we can deal with the reactors.

77
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,238
Did you take a train?

78
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,718
Yes, I took a train.

79
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,359
Now let's talk about Vienna.

80
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,959
I'm not here to scold you.

81
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:37,799
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

82
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,838
So, why are you here?

83
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:44,718
Because I'm brutally stubborn.

84
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,999
Which you were hoping for.

85
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,878
Charkov is saying they're going to fix
the reactors after the trial.

86
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,878
Do you believe him?

87
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,398
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors

88
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,678
because acknowledging the problem
means admitting that they lied.

89
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,399
They will have to be forced.

90
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,399
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

91
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:22,279
You're going to convince the jury.

92
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,958
It's a show trial.

93
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,519
The jury's already been
handed their verdict.

94
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:27,879
I'm not talking about them.

95
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:33,878
The Central Committee have invited
members of the scientific community

96
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,318
to observe the trial.

97
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,599
Our colleagues, from Kurchatov,

98
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:40,998
from Sredmash, from Minenergo,

99
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,518
they will be sitting in the crowd
listening to every word you say.

100
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,718
A jury that only we know is there.

101
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,158
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

102
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,039
That is when our jury
will finally hear the truth.

103
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,638
-And do what with it?
-Insist on reform.

104
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,358
Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.

105
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,399
<i>No, no, no.</i>

106
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:04,919
-They can't function without us.
-No,no,no.

107
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,958
If we...

108
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:09,918
Do you know what happened to Volkov,
the man whose report you found?

109
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:14,198
They just removed him
from his position at the Institute.

110
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,279
Sacked for the crime of knowing.

111
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:23,039
And you think that these scientists,
handpicked to witness a show trial,

112
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:26,198
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

113
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,318
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

114
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,598
Yes.

115
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,678
Why?

116
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,039
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

117
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,678
I'd like to think that if I spoke out,
it would be enough.

118
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,678
But I know how the world works.

119
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:49,479
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

120
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,919
You told me to find out what happened.

121
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,038
I spoke to dozens of people.

122
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,198
Every word they said, I wrote down.

123
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,678
All in these books.

124
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,479
These are the ones
who are still alive.

125
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,118
These are the ones who are dead.

126
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,758
They died rescuing each other.

127
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:12,959
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

128
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,719
They didn't hesitate.
They didn't waiver.

129
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,799
They simply did what had to be done.

130
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:17,838
So have I.

131
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,038
So have I.

132
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,079
I went willingly to an open reactor.

133
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,278
So I've already given my life.

134
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:28,719
Isn't that enough?

135
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,839
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

136
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,239
"The Central Committee of the

the Council of Ministers

162
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:53,358
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

163
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:30,798
It began with,
of all things, a safety test.

164
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,598
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

165
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,318
Reactor number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

166
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,518
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

167
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:47,398
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

168
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,518
plant director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document,

169
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:58,678
certifying the completion
of the construction of the reactor.

170
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:03,518
As a result of finishing the work
before the end of the year,

171
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:08,438
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

172
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:12,718
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

173
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:16,998
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

174
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,678
But their work was not finished.

175
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,398
And this document was a lie.

176
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,198
In order to sign this certificate,

177
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:34,478
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

178
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,278
and yet, one remained.

179
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,638
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

180
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,718
A series of pumps, here and here,

181
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,718
send a constant flow of cooling water
through the core.

182
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,598
The core's heat
turns the water to steam,

183
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,878
and the steam spins the turbine here,

184
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,518
and the result is electricity.

185
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:59,998
But what if a power plant
has no power?

186
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,438
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

187
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:09,398
A blackout, equipment failure,
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

188
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:12,238
If there's no power,

189
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,958
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

190
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,678
And without water, the core overheats,

191
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:19,238
the fuel melts down.

192
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,718
In short, a nuclear disaster.

193
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:22,878
The solution?

194
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:26,638
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

195
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:28,918
So, problem solved?

196
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,598
No.

197
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:33,598
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

198
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,918
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

199
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:39,278
to reach the speed required

200
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,478
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

201
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:44,437
and by that time,
it would be too late.

202
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,598
So we arrive at the safety test.

203
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,038
The theory was this,

204
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,238
if the facility lost power,

205
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:55,118
the turbine, which had been spinning,

206
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,958
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

207
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,678
What if you could take the electricity
it was still generating

208
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,158
and transfer it to the pumps?

209
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:06,918
What if the dying turbine could keep
the pumps working long enough

210
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:10,918
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

211
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,158
Any questions?

212
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:21,758
No. Continue, please.

213
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,758
To test this theory,

214
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:30,078
the reactor is placed in a reduced
power mode, 700 megawatts,

215
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:31,838
to simulate a blackout condition.

216
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,718
Then the turbines are turned off,

217
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,678
and as they slowly spin down,

218
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,518
their electrical output is measured

219
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,438
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

220
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,518
The science is strong,

221
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:49,037
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

222
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:53,198
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

223
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,078
The second time they tried,
they failed.

224
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,758
The third time they tried,
they failed.

225
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,038
The fourth time they tried

226
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:05,598
was April 26th, 1986.

227
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:18,918
Comrade Khomyuk.

228
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,718
To understand
what happened that night,

229
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,758
we have to go back 10 hours earlier,

230
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:49,078
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

231
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:52,478
By 2:00 in the afternoon,
the reactor has been lowered by half

232
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,557
from its normal output level
of 3,200 megawatts

233
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,798
to 1,600 megawatts and is stable

234
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,678
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test,

235
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:02,238
700 megawatts.

236
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:06,358
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

237
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:10,598
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

238
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:13,838
a further reduction in the electricity
until after midnight.

239
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,158
They are asking for a 10-hour delay.

240
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,158
This is the first critical moment,

241
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:21,757
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

242
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,078
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

243
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,877
These three men allowed it to proceed.

244
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:32,558
Why was this delay so dangerous?

245
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,718
It created two problems.

246
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,438
One of them is scientific in nature,

247
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:40,677
and the other is very human.

248
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,638
This is the one
we will consider first.

249
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:48,438
<i>At midnight, there is a shift change.</i>

250
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,357
Hey.

251
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,637
-Khodemchuk...
-Forget it. Find another fool.

252
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,558
Toptunov, want to buy a motorcycle?

253
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:10,918
Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

254
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:12,798
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

255
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:15,038
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?

256
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,078
Leonid Fedorovych.

257
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,158
Akimov says to come to the
control room as soon as you can.

258
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,797
-Is he already here?
-He came in early.

259
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,518
Something about a test.

260
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,397
You see? Desperate.

261
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:38,758
Sasha?

262
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:42,638
You know the test
they were supposed to run?

263
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,198
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

264
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,318
They couldn't do it on the day shift,
so they've given it to us.

265
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:50,518
To us?

266
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:51,918
- We don't know what...
- Shh...

267
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,678
-We don't know what it is.
-It's fine.

268
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,798
We take it down to 700, hold it there,

269
00:21:57,877 --> 00:22:00,198
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

270
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,758
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

271
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,198
I have to do something
I've never done before

272
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:06,558
with Dyatlov looking over my shoulder?

273
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:09,358
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

274
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,917
I'm just looking
at the instructions now.

275
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:14,357
Are we supposed to do those or not?

276
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,838
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

277
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,798
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

278
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:31,158
You did it last year.

279
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,198
Yes, in the program,
there's instructions of what to do,

280
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:36,478
and then, well,
there's a lot of things crossed out.

281
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,517
What should I...

282
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,638
Well, what should I...

283
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:44,038
Are you sure?

284
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,238
Right. Thank you.

285
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,998
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

286
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,037
So then why are they crossed out?

287
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,397
We've been cleared to run the test.

288
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:03,877
1,600. Good.

289
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,238
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know What you're doing?

290
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,077
-Well...
-Yes. Absolutely.

291
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,998
-Stolyarchuk?
-Yes.

292
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,957
-Kirschenbaum?
-Uh, I haven't reviewed.

293
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,757
We only just found out really...

294
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:17,997
There, review it.

295
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,078
Or you can just do what I tell you.

296
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:22,677
I think even you, stupid as you are,
can manage that.

297
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:24,758
Well, let's go.

298
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,358
I'm supposed to switch the turbine off
While the reactor's still running?

299
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:34,717
-This is not good...
-Shut the fuck up and do your job!

300
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:39,038
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

301
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:42,758
I've never done this
with the power so low before.

302
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,158
It's okay. I'm with you.

303
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,238
Reducing power to 700.

304
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,958
<i>I want you
to think of Yuri Gagarin.</i>

305
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,557
I want you to imagine
that he has been told nothing

306
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,838
of his mission into space

307
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,997
until the moment
that he is on the launch pad.

308
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,238
I want you to imagine that all he has

309
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,797
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

310
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,837
some of which have been crossed out.

311
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:13,918
This is exactly what was happening
in the control room of Reactor 4.

312
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:17,158
The night shift had not been trained
to perform the experiment.

313
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:19,717
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

314
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:21,637
Leonid Toptunov,

315
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:24,198
the operator
responsible for controlling

316
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,638
and stabilizing the reactor
that night was

317
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,918
all of 25 years old.

318
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,118
And his total experience on the job?

319
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,357
Four months.

320
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,678
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

321
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,518
But inside the reactor core,

322
00:24:43,597 --> 00:24:45,637
in the space
between the atoms themselves,

323
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,677
something far more dangerous
is forming.

324
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:50,118
A poison.

325
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,557
The time is 28 past midnight.

326
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:13,118
Comrade Legasov.

327
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,558
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

328
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,197
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

329
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,558
But you don't
need to be a nuclear scientist

330
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,557
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

331
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,557
You only need to know this.

332
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:07,117
There are essentially two things
that happen inside a nuclear reactor.

333
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:13,318
The reactivity, which generates power,
either goes up or it goes down.

334
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:14,917
That's it.

335
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:18,477
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

336
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:22,477
Uranium fuel.

337
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:29,518
As uranium atoms split apart
and collide, reactivity goes up.

338
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,477
But if you don't balance
the reactivity,

339
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:33,478
it never stops rising. So...

340
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,957
Boron control rods.

341
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,517
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

342
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:47,518
But there's a third factor
to consider, water.

343
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:51,557
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

344
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:54,837
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

345
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:58,198
In an RBMK reactor
of the type used at Chernobyl,

346
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:01,957
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

347
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,157
What does that mean?

348
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:08,157
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

349
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,238
the higher the reactivity,

350
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:13,118
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

351
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:14,157
which means...

352
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:18,317
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

353
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:21,317
And we would, were it not for this...

354
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:32,358
And we would, were it not for this,

355
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:34,637
the negative temperature coefficient.

356
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:41,357
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive,

357
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:44,437
so fuel increases reactivity.

358
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,877
Control rods and water reduce it.

359
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,237
Steam increases it,

360
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:52,677
and the rise in temperature
reduces it.

361
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:57,077
This is the invisible dance

362
00:27:57,158 --> 00:28:00,677
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

363
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,997
And it is beautiful,

364
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:05,477
when things are normal.

365
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:10,038
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

366
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:13,397
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

367
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:16,277
Xenon reduces reactivity.

368
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,797
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

369
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:21,677
When the core
is running at full power,

370
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:24,517
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

371
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,717
But because of the delay,

372
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,438
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has been held
at half power for 10 hours.

373
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,277
The xenon did not burn away.

374
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:38,878
It built up, poisoning the core.

375
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:41,957
We're starting to lose balance.

376
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:45,677
At 28 minutes past midnight,

377
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,637
the reactor is now primed
to slow down.

378
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,517
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

379
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:56,477
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

380
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,158
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

381
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,837
After all, you don't work in the
control room of a nuclear power plant.

382
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,997
But as it turned out,

383
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,917
the men who did
didn't understand it either.

384
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,037
Easy now.

385
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:18,597
Take it down.

386
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:21,597
Good. Like that.

387
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,117
You should have
finished by now.

388
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:25,078
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

389
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,917
You're procrastinating.

390
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,357
There are 10 other men in this plant
who would've done it already.

391
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,678
Keep working.
You're doing fine.

392
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:44,037
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

393
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,357
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

394
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:08,237
Okay, very slow now.
Let's ease it down to 700.

395
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:14,637
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow.
-I didn't move any rods there.

396
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,117
-What is this?
-I'm not even touching it.

397
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,197
We did everything right.

398
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:53,597
I think that
maybe the core is poisoned.

399
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:55,037
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

400
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:57,557
then you didn't do everything right,
because you're choking my reactor!

401
00:30:57,637 --> 00:30:58,637
Get it back up!

402
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:00,837
I think if we turn off LAC,

403
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,757
it may be possible
to get more control.

404
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:05,437
-Do it. Go.
-Switch off local automatic control.

405
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:07,517
Go to global. Leonid.

406
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:10,677
LAC disabled.
Global control activated.

407
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:17,997
What did you do?

408
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:21,477
- I did what you said. I switched...
- Look at it!

409
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,958
- I don't understand.
- Fucking amateurs.

410
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:26,797
You've stalled the reactor.

411
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:28,637
How the fuck
did you get this job?

412
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:29,758
Comrade Dyatlov...

413
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,398
You're gonna tell me
you did everything right again,

414
00:31:31,477 --> 00:31:32,797
you incompetent asshole?

415
00:31:32,877 --> 00:31:35,477
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

416
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,157
What are you doing?

417
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:44,237
We have to shut all the way down.

418
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,677
- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

419
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,157
We have to shut down
and wait 24 hours.

420
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,197
No. We're doing the test tonight.
Raise power to 700.

421
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:51,597
We can't raise
the power from here.

422
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,197
-The rules...
-Don't talk to me about rules.

423
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,357
-If we fall from 80%...
-No, no. We fell from 50%.

424
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,517
- 50% is even worse.
- The rules don't say 50.

425
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:58,837
There is no rule!

426
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,637
Comrade Dyatlov, I apologize,
but what you're saying makes no sense.

427
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:04,557
-Raise the power.
-No.

428
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:07,637
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

429
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:19,237
Safety first. Always.

430
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:22,437
I've been saying that for 25 years.

431
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:24,437
That's how long
I've done this job, 25 years.

432
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:25,757
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

433
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:26,877
Yes.

434
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:29,077
-Is it much longer?
-Yes.

435
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,597
And you with your mother's tit
barely out of your mouth?

436
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,157
So if I say it's safe, it's safe.

437
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,477
And if the two of you disagree,

438
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,437
then you don't have to work here
and you won't.

439
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:40,477
But not just here.

440
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:43,877
You won't work at Kursk or Ignalina
or Leningrad or Novovoronezh.

441
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:46,877
You won't work anywhere ever again.
I'll see to it.

442
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:49,557
I think you know I will see to it.

443
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:52,357
Raise the power.

444
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,477
I would like you
to record your command.

445
00:32:58,717 --> 00:32:59,757
Raise the power.

446
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,117
Together, then.

447
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,277
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

448
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:23,397
What?

449
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:27,677
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

450
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,797
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

451
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:32,677
Comrade Legasov,
you are a witness, not a prosecutor.

452
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,517
I will ask the questions here.

453
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,677
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

454
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,317
The toilet.

455
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,437
The toilet?

456
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,877
Comrade Khomyuk interviewed everyone

457
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:49,317
who was in the control room
that night.

458
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,117
They all told the same story.

459
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:56,717
"I knew what Dyatlov
ordered was wrong,

460
00:33:57,157 --> 00:33:59,397
"but if I didn't do what he said,
I would be fired."

461
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,397
Leonid Toptunov.

462
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,557
One day before he died.

463
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:07,357
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

464
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:10,077
You ordered them to raise the power.
This is a fact.

465
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,517
Court is now in recess.
Thirty minutes.

466
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:07,357
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

467
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,277
Not really, no.

468
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:13,957
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

469
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:18,957
The Jews were killed in pogroms,
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

470
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:22,717
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

471
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:24,877
But after the war,

472
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:28,157
people came to live here anyway.

473
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:32,916
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

474
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,156
but they didn't care.

475
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:37,797
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

476
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:39,957
But not them.

477
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,557
No one ever thinks
it's going to happen to them.

478
00:35:47,637 --> 00:35:48,637
And here we are.

479
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,157
How much time?

480
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,437
Maybe a year.

481
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,957
They call it a...

482
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,117
They call it a "long illness."

483
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:08,837
It doesn't seem very long to me.

484
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,997
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

485
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,037
But time passed, and I thought

486
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,517
it wouldn't happen to me.

487
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:19,917
I wasted it.

488
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,597
I wasted it all for nothing.

489
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:25,996
For nothing?

490
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:30,077
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

491
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:31,997
how unconcerned I was?

492
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,877
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

493
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:38,076
but when they told me they were
putting me in charge of the cleanup

494
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,397
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

495
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:44,277
You know why?

496
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,597
Because they put you in charge.

497
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:49,517
Yeah.

498
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,796
I'm an inconsequential man, Valery.

499
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,157
That's all I've ever been.

500
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:01,116
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

501
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:06,117
I just stood next to people who did.

502
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:10,836
There are other scientists like me.

503
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,197
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

504
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:14,437
But you...

505
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:19,157
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

506
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:23,797
Men, material, lunar rovers.

507
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,357
Who else could have done these things?

508
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:33,037
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

509
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:37,677
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies,

510
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:41,237
entire congregation of obedient fools,

511
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,996
they mistakenly sent the one good man.

512
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:47,957
For God's sakes, Boris,

513
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,237
you were the one who mattered most.

514
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:15,036
Ah, it's beautiful.

515
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,117
Comrade Legasov.

516
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,157
The time is 38 past midnight.

517
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,876
The reactor is nearly shut down.

518
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,237
The operators of Reactor 4 are locked

519
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,396
on a path that leads
directly to disaster.

520
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,517
There's no way to turn back.

521
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,277
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

522
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:27,557
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

523
00:39:27,637 --> 00:39:29,317
but none of it is burning away.

524
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,317
The reactor is drowning in poison.

525
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:37,557
To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

526
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,117
to produce sufficient steam.

527
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:44,637
The only way to safely raise
power from this state

528
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,877
is to do it very, very slowly
over the course of 24 hours.

529
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,837
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

530
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,677
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

531
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,797
They begin pulling control rods out.

532
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:00,397
Dozens at a time.

533
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,357
Halfway out,
three-quarters of the way out,

534
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:06,116
still, the power does not budge.

535
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,797
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

536
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:12,517
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

537
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:17,076
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

538
00:40:17,157 --> 00:40:20,997
Remember, control rods
are the brakes on this car.

539
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:27,916
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

540
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:32,036
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

541
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:34,037
so the negative
temperature coefficient

542
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:36,596
is no longer
weighing down the reactivity.

543
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:40,396
But even still,
the xenon poisoning is so strong,

544
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:43,917
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

545
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,996
The control rods are out.

546
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:49,797
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

547
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,956
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

548
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,516
is water and xenon.

549
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:58,356
It's 1:00 in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

550
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:33,516
I'm sorry, this is all we can get.

551
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:36,317
It's 200 megawatts.
We've pulled almost everything out.

552
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:38,276
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

553
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:42,116
-But the test requires 700.
-Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

554
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:43,796
- Switch on pump four.
- No, wait a second.

555
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,757
- Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

556
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,156
The turbine is going too slow for
the test to deliver any valid results.

557
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,556
-It's enough.
-And if we add more water,

558
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,237
-there will be even less...
-I said it's enough.

559
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:52,436
I know what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

560
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,836
Main pump four, connected.

561
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:01,837
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be...

562
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,357
Never mind him. Kirschenbaum?

563
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:09,197
The steam in the separator drum
is too low, five atmospheres.

564
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,876
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

565
00:42:15,996 --> 00:42:17,037
We should stop.

566
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:19,276
Turn that fucking thing off.

567
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:21,957
You have 15 minutes.

568
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:24,877
<i>Fifteen minutes.</i>

569
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,397
<i>They may as well have had 15 days.</i>

570
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:31,356
The problem they were facing
was not solvable.

571
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:33,956
The power was too low.
The water was too high.

572
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,596
The test was already ruined.

573
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:38,516
The results would have been useless,
but Dyatlov didn't care.

574
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,516
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

575
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,956
<i>1:22 am.</i>

576
00:42:45,636 --> 00:42:47,436
<i>Less than two minutes remain.</i>

577
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:52,437
<i>Yuvchenko, a mechanical engineer,
is in his office.</i>

578
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:58,757
<i>Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,</i>

579
00:42:58,836 --> 00:42:59,957
<i>is in the refueling hall,</i>

580
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:03,957
<i>high above the 1,000—ton
steel reactor cover.</i>

581
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:08,197
<i>Degtaryenko, Khodemchuk,</i>

582
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:10,957
<i>circulation operators,
are in the pump room.</i>

583
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:16,236
None of them
have been told about the test.

584
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:18,077
None of them know
what is about to happen.

585
00:43:18,836 --> 00:43:23,677
<i>At 1:22 and 30 seconds,
Toptunov sees a report</i>

586
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:27,237
<i>from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.</i>

587
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:31,596
<i>Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,</i>

588
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:34,716
<i>the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.</i>

589
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:42,757
Well, of course it's saying that.
It doesn't know we're running a test.

590
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:45,876
All right, comrades.

591
00:43:47,636 --> 00:43:50,037
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

592
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:51,436
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

593
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:53,757
We did everything right.

594
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:57,597
Oscillograph on.

595
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,157
Closing number eight throttle valve.

596
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:03,716
Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

597
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:06,757
<i>1:23 and four seconds.</i>

598
00:44:07,556 --> 00:44:11,277
With every decision, they have pulled
this reactor back like a slingshot,

599
00:44:11,356 --> 00:44:13,316
further than anyone has ever pulled.

600
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:15,397
Now the test begins.

601
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:18,756
The pumps are shut down,
and they've let go.

602
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:24,396
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

603
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:27,996
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

604
00:44:28,076 --> 00:44:29,957
unchecked by control rods.

605
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:32,916
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

606
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,997
In less than a second,
reactivity increases.

607
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:38,636
<i>Inside the core,</i>

608
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,956
<i>the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.</i>

609
00:44:41,037 --> 00:44:43,117
<i>A void is being created.</i>

610
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:45,636
<i>There is no fresh water to replace it.</i>

611
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,516
Steam increases reactivity,

612
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:51,757
increases heat, increases steam,

613
00:44:51,836 --> 00:44:53,397
increases reactivity.

614
00:44:54,637 --> 00:44:57,556
The remaining xenon decays away.

615
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,356
The power is rising.

616
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:03,996
There's nothing left to stop it.

617
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:08,596
<i>1:23 and 35 seconds.</i>

618
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,796
We have a power surge! Sasha!

619
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:20,157
What did you do?

620
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,796
1:23 and 40 seconds.

621
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:34,076
In every control room
of every nuclear reactor in the world,

622
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:37,196
there is a button
with one single purpose,

623
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:40,556
to "scram," or instantly
shut down the reaction.

624
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:43,756
In Soviet reactors,
that button is called AZ-5.

625
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:46,597
You press AZ-5,

626
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:48,797
all of the control rods
insert at once,

627
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:52,276
and the reaction is stopped dead.

628
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,437
But...

629
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,957
What are you waiting for, Legasov?

630
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,877
Tell your lies.

631
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:06,077
Comrade Dyatlov,
you will not be warned again.

632
00:46:06,156 --> 00:46:08,277
- Or what?
- For God's sake, Dyatlov.

633
00:46:08,356 --> 00:46:10,276
-Legasov's already given it away.
-That's enough.

634
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:13,276
He said before there was no way
to avoid What was coming.

635
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,916
-He knows something.
-Comrade Dyatlov.

636
00:46:14,997 --> 00:46:16,517
She knows something.

637
00:46:17,757 --> 00:46:19,716
I know what you are,
Valery Alexeyevich.

638
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:22,677
-You're a liar.
-We've heard enough for today.

639
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:26,397
The defendants will be
remanded in custody.

640
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:29,356
-Court will...
-I haven't finished.

641
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:31,476
I still have more evidence to give.

642
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:34,716
It's not necessary.
Your testimony is concluded.

643
00:46:34,796 --> 00:46:37,836
-Your Honor.
-Court is now adjourned.

644
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,036
- We will resume tomorrow with...
- Let him finish.

645
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,916
Comrade Shcherbina...

646
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:47,556
Let him finish.

647
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:14,036
Dyatlov broke every rule we have.

648
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:20,596
He pushed a reactor
to the brink of destruction.

649
00:47:24,957 --> 00:47:27,436
He did these things believing
there was a fail safe.

650
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:30,837
AZ-5, a simple button
to shut it all down.

651
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:35,276
But in the circumstances he created,
there wasn't.

652
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:38,436
The shutdown system had a fatal flaw.

653
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:45,517
At 1:23:40, Akimov engages AZ-5.

654
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:56,876
The fully withdrawn control rods
begin moving back into the reactor.

655
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:59,517
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity,

656
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:00,636
but not their tips.

657
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:05,556
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

658
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:06,996
Why?

659
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:12,556
Why?

660
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:17,276
For the same reason our reactors

661
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:19,356
do not have containment
buildings around them,

662
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:21,356
like those in the West.

663
00:48:21,436 --> 00:48:25,956
For the same reason we don't use
properly enriched fuel in our cores.

664
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:28,436
For the same reason
we are the only nation

665
00:48:28,516 --> 00:48:32,676
that builds water-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors

666
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:35,116
with a positive void coefficient.

667
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:37,917
It's cheaper.

668
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:45,076
The first part

669
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:46,876
of the rods that enter the core

670
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:48,236
are the graphite tips.

671
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:50,556
And when they do,
the reaction in the core,

672
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,396
which had been rising, skyrockets.

673
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:58,276
Every last molecule of liquid water
instantly converts to steam,

674
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:01,516
which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

675
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:05,516
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

676
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:07,956
The graphite tips
are fixed in position,

677
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,796
endlessly accelerating the reaction.

678
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:14,556
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

679
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:17,516
<i>1:23:42.</i>

680
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:21,396
<i>Perevozchenko looks down on
the enormous steel lid of the reactor</i>

681
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:23,396
<i>and sees the impossible.</i>

682
00:49:23,476 --> 00:49:25,196
<i>The control rod and fuel channel caps,</i>

683
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:27,276
<i>which each weigh 350 kilograms,</i>

684
00:49:27,356 --> 00:49:28,956
<i>are jumping up and down.</i>

685
00:49:29,476 --> 00:49:31,596
<i>He runs to warn the control room.</i>

686
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,476
<i>But there's nothing he can do
to stop what is coming.</i>

687
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:37,437
<i>1:23</i> and 44 <i>seconds.</i>

688
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:41,316
<i>The steam blows
more fuel channels apart.</i>

689
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,356
<i>We do not know
how high the power went.</i>

690
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:44,596
<i>We only know the final reading.</i>

691
00:49:47,076 --> 00:49:51,436
Reactor 4, designed to operate
at 3,200 megawatts,

692
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,596
went beyond 33,000.

693
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:03,756
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

694
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:09,876
At long last, we have arrived.
1:23:45, explosion.

695
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:14,276
<i>In the instant the lid is
thrown off the reactor,</i>

696
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:15,356
<i>oxygen rushes in.</i>

697
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:19,356
<i>It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.</i>

698
00:50:21,316 --> 00:50:24,036
<i>The chain of disaster is now complete.</i>

699
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,636
Comrade Dyatlov!

700
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:52,956
Comrade Dyatlov!

701
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:06,756
No one in the room
that night knew

702
00:51:06,836 --> 00:51:09,875
the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

703
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:12,716
They didn't know it,

704
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:16,236
because it was kept from them.

705
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:20,876
Comrade Legasov, you're contradicting
your own testimony in Vienna.

706
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,156
My testimony in Vienna was a lie.

707
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:26,796
I lied to the world.

708
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:29,356
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

709
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,396
There are many.

710
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:33,276
We were following orders,

711
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,356
from the KGB,
from the Central Committee.

712
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:38,876
And right now, there are
16 reactors in the Soviet Union

713
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:41,316
with the same fatal flaw.

714
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:43,196
Three of them are still running

715
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:45,596
less than 20 kilometers away
at Chernobyl.

716
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:49,436
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet state

717
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:51,276
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

718
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:53,956
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

719
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:56,235
I've already trod on dangerous ground.

720
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:58,276
We're on dangerous ground right now,

721
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:00,996
because of our secrets and our lies.

722
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,996
They're practically what define us.

723
00:52:04,076 --> 00:52:07,156
When the truth offends, we lie and lie

724
00:52:07,236 --> 00:52:09,395
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

725
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:10,996
But it is still there.

726
00:52:14,516 --> 00:52:18,396
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

727
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,756
Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

728
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:32,196
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

729
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:37,036
Lies.

730
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,796
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

731
00:54:40,316 --> 00:54:42,436
son of Alexei Legasov,

732
00:54:42,636 --> 00:54:44,996
Head of Ideological Compliance,
Central Committee.

733
00:54:45,996 --> 00:54:47,436
Do you know
what your father did there?

734
00:54:47,756 --> 00:54:48,716
Yes.

735
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,236
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

736
00:54:53,316 --> 00:54:55,276
Communist Youth, correct?

737
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:58,436
-You already know.
-Answer the question.

738
00:54:58,836 --> 00:54:59,836
Yes.

739
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,676
At the Kurchatov Institute,

740
00:55:03,756 --> 00:55:05,836
you were the
Communist Party secretary.

741
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:10,035
In the position, you limited
the promotion of Jewish scientists.

742
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:16,316
Yes.

743
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,916
To curry favor with Kremlin officials.

744
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:26,116
You're one of us, Legasov.

745
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,676
I can do anything I want with you.

746
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:34,116
But what I want the most is
for you to know that I know.

747
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:36,796
You're not brave.

748
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:39,676
You're not heroic.

749
00:55:41,276 --> 00:55:44,516
You're just a dying man
who forgot himself.

750
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,916
I know who I am,
and I know what I've done.

751
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:52,876
In a just world,
I'd be shot for my lies,

752
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:55,076
but not for this, not for the truth.

753
00:55:55,995 --> 00:55:58,076
Scientists,

754
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:01,715
and your idiot obsession
with reasons.

755
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:06,036
When the bullet hits
your skull, what will it matter why?

756
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:15,636
No one's getting shot, Legasov.

757
00:56:17,276 --> 00:56:18,875
The whole world saw you in Vienna.

758
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,676
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

759
00:56:21,755 --> 00:56:22,756
And for what?

760
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:26,995
Your testimony today
will not be accepted by the State.

761
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:29,315
It will not be disseminated
in the press.

762
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:31,716
It never happened.

763
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:37,115
No, you will live,
however long you have,

764
00:56:37,876 --> 00:56:40,516
but not as a scientist, not anymore.

765
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:45,276
You'll keep your title
and your office,

766
00:56:46,435 --> 00:56:50,596
but no duties,
no authority, no friends.

767
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:51,955
No one will talk to you.

768
00:56:52,755 --> 00:56:54,076
No one will listen to you.

769
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:59,716
Other men, lesser men,

770
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:03,396
will receive credit
for the things you have done.

771
00:57:04,316 --> 00:57:06,516
Your legacy is now their legacy.

772
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:08,716
You'll live long enough to see that.

773
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:14,275
What role did Shcherbina play in this?

774
00:57:14,995 --> 00:57:16,036
None.

775
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:17,875
He didn't know what I was gonna say.

776
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,715
What role did Khomyuk play in this?

777
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,315
None.

778
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:25,515
She didn't know either.

779
00:57:27,956 --> 00:57:30,315
After all you've said and done today,

780
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:35,795
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

781
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:42,716
I would think a man of your experience
would know a lie when he hears one.

782
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:49,756
You will not meet or communicate
with either one of them ever again.

783
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:54,516
You will not communicate with anyone
about Chernobyl ever again.

784
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:58,116
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

785
00:57:58,195 --> 00:57:59,996
that when you finally do die,

786
00:58:00,596 --> 00:58:04,036
it will be exceedingly hard
to know that you ever lived at all.

787
00:58:08,315 --> 00:58:09,955
And if I refuse?

788
00:58:13,196 --> 00:58:15,995
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

789
00:58:17,355 --> 00:58:20,436
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

790
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:22,835
Oh, that's perfect.

791
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:25,436
They should put that on our money.

792
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:35,636
<i><i>To be a scientist is to be naive.</i>

793
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:39,155
<i>We are so focused
on our search for truth,</i>

794
00:59:39,235 --> 00:59:43,235
<i>we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.</i>

795
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:47,795
<i>But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,</i>

796
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,756
<i>whether we choose to or not.</i>

797
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:52,435
<i>The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.</i>

798
00:59:52,516 --> 00:59:54,116
<i>It doesn't care about our governments,</i>

799
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:56,435
<i>our ideologies, our religions.</i>

800
00:59:57,836 --> 01:00:00,196
<i>It will lie in wait for all time.</i>

801
01:00:01,436 --> 01:00:05,195
<i>And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.</i>

802
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:07,635
<i>Where I once would fear
the cost of truth,</i>

803
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:09,275
<i>now I only ask,</i>

804
01:00:11,355 --> 01:00:13,235
<i>"What is the cost of lies?"</i>
