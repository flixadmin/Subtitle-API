1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,007
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,220
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,059
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,101
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,773
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,906
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,405
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,615
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,114
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,704
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,039
Your past, your present, your future.

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,422
- Say, Iris, you look amazing.
- Thanks, Tony.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,458
His skin changed. lt turned to metal.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,549
Tony might have been a bully,
but he didn't deserve to die.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,301
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,263
I can't help but wonder, maybe,
we were meant to be together.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,395
- You lost your powers?
- I gave them up to save Wally.

18
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,933
I can recreate the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

19
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,567
Let's set off the Particle Accelerator.

20
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,951
Barry, he's gone.

21
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,536
This wasn't...

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,657
I didn't...

23
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,658
I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,868
We lost him.

25
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,000
No, no, no.

26
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,880
He could've gotten knocked somewhere,

27
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,624
or maybe even run there.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,338
Nothing on the GPS.

29
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,676
There were strikes all over the building.

30
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,011
Jesse, come down here please.

31
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,472
Jesse? Wally?

32
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,151
Oh, God! Wally! No.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,606
No!

34
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,901
- Wally, wake up! Can you hear me?
- No!

35
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,612
- Wally!
- Jesse, Jesse. Jesse!

36
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,371
- Wally!
- Jesse!

37
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,625
Stop yelling, please.

38
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:01,084
Her heart's stopped. Her heart stopped.

39
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,962
- Jesse...
- Are you okay?

40
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,008
Jesse!

41
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,730
It's beating, her heart's beating.

42
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,981
Henry's a doctor. He should see her.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,268
I'm so glad you're okay.

44
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,895
Hey, what's with him?

45
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,863
It's Barry.

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,195
Barry's gone.

47
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,284
Are you good, Wally?

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,737
Okay, we should get you home,
get some rest. Okay?

49
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,747
- Wait, I don't understand...
- No, it's okay, let's go.

50
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,080
Jesse.

51
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,340
Henry, Wells' daughter is upstairs.

52
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,841
The energy hit her, too.

53
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,255
Her heart stopped beating. Henry!

54
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,132
All right.

55
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,117
I saw him. I saw Barry.

56
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,115
He's alive.

57
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,440
Joe?

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,322
Good to see you, Barry.

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,698
But I'm not Joe.

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,292
- You're not?
- No.

61
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,835
And all of this.

62
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,751
It's not real?

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,547
How do you feel, being back here?

64
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,970
I feel awful.

65
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,058
We thought you'd be more comfortable

66
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,143
talking to someone who looked familiar,

67
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,111
and in a place you knew.

68
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:12,984
We?

69
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,569
Who is we exactly?

70
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,115
That's a little hard to explain.

71
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,364
Sit, Barry.

72
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
Sit.

73
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,846
How much do you know
about the Speed Force?

74
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,600
It's the source of my power.

75
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,261
- It's what makes me a speedster.
- Yes.

76
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,388
And no.

77
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,276
When the first sub-atomic particle
sprang forth from the Big Bang

78
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,230
to form reality as you know it,

79
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,774
we were there.

80
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,443
When the last proton decays,

81
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,951
stops vibrating and
plunges the universe into heat death,

82
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,079
we'll be there, too.

83
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,995
I'm talking to the Speed Force?

84
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,129
Isn't that like saying I'm having a
conversation with gravity, or light, or...

85
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,637
You need a minute?

86
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,811
It's okay if you do,

87
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,018
it's a, a lot to take in.

88
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,860
So, you're saying, I'm talking
to the source of my power,

89
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,571
which just so happens to look like...

90
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,202
My adoptive dad?

91
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,030
That's trippy.

92
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,575
We pretty much invented trippy here.

93
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,161
Look, I'm not sure why you

94
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,838
brought me here,
but you need to send me back.

95
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,090
My friends are in danger from Zoom.

96
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,675
Did you see that?

97
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,471
You're not going back.

98
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,099
Not until...

99
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,681
Until what?

100
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,072
Until you catch that.

101
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,214
Cisco says Barry is still alive.
Where is he?

102
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,554
- I don't know.
- Harry, I vibed him.

103
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,758
In the center of a storm.
He was in, like, a vortex or something.

104
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,851
He's in...

105
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,393
- He's in the Speed Force.
- Get him out, damn it.

106
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,732
- You can get him out, can't you?
- I don't know if I can.

107
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,110
Henry, come here.

108
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,949
Listen, you are the only one
that can help Jesse.

109
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,412
Let me sit on Wells until he figures out
what the hell he did to Barry

110
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,627
- and we can get him back.
- Joe, I know you love Barry.

111
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,835
Okay? But you have Iris
and you have Wally.

112
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,502
Barry's all I have left.

113
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,005
I promise, we'll find him.

114
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,848
Thank God, you're here.

115
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,439
Caitlin's usually the one
doing this, but...

116
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,728
Heart rate's normal,

117
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,402
reflexes and breathing are fine.

118
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,782
She should be waking up.

119
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,575
She's just not.

120
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,116
It was the same with Barry.

121
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,031
Um...

122
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,209
After the first accident, he was in a coma
that no one could explain.

123
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,827
What did you do with him?

124
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,584
So they brought him here.
Well, Wells brought him here.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,127
The other Wells.

126
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,258
Right, the Wells who was actually Thawne.

127
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,090
- Eobard, not Eddie.
- Right.

128
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,466
It's, it's complicated.

129
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,929
Anyway, we took care of Barry
while Wells, Thawne treated him.

130
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,768
Are there any records of that treatment?

131
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,928
We might find clues how to help Jesse.

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,770
Uh, yeah, they'd be downstairs
in the storage room, in the morgue.

133
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,648
Ew! You guys have a morgue?

134
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,653
Well, it's not like a "morgue" morgue.
It's not like...

135
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,985
It's like a poor man's
morgue, really. Morgue-ish.

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,238
Would both of you go get them? Please.

137
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
Okay. Well, I'm not going alone.

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,039
Thank you.

139
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,378
Okay, so it's a morgue-morgue.

140
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,164
But, you know, we had to keep the
dead meta-humans somewhere.

141
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,132
Yeah, looks like you did a lot more
than just store them.

142
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,552
Fake Wells might've done a few
dissections for study purposes.

143
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,260
And this didn't tip any of you off
that he might be secretly evil?

144
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,849
It was a crazy time, okay?
We had a lot going on.

145
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,191
I'll tell you what, it's a good thing
Thawne was so organized.

146
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,820
Would you stop knocking stuff over?

147
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,364
Would you stop,
I didn't touch anything.

148
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,866
Okay, whatever you say.

149
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,902
Okay, this is it. This is Barry's X-files.

150
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,163
A zombie? For real?

151
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,638
- Tony?
- Nope, not Tony, not anymore.

152
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,852
- Get behind me.
- You get behind me.

153
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,522
Tony.

154
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,215
- Didn't see that one coming.
- Zombie Girder. This...

155
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,274
Iris.

156
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,152
We're glad you made it, Barry.

157
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,197
Not Iris.

158
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,329
It's just you again.

159
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,704
Sit, Barry. Sit.

160
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,840
You're always on your feet.

161
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,805
You remember this place?

162
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,018
Where we first kissed?

163
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,977
Yeah, of course, except that wasn't you.

164
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,237
We thought you'd find this place
and our appearance less upsetting.

165
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,399
Yet, you seem upset.

166
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,445
My friends, my city,

167
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,531
my whole world is in danger.

168
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,248
Zoom is on a rampage with the power
that he stole from me

169
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,707
and you are keeping me here.

170
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,878
You were given a rare and precious gift

171
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,924
and you rejected it.

172
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,924
No, I did not reject it.

173
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:37,098
I gave up my powers to save
someone's life, to be a hero.

174
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,805
I nearly killed myself
trying to get them back

175
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,811
when you brought me here.
Wherever here is.

176
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,932
- That's not what we meant.
- Okay.

177
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,150
If you would rather have given
these powers to somebody else,

178
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,697
why did you give them to me?

179
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,743
Because you're The Flash, Barry.

180
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,198
We got a new problem.

181
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,242
Our accelerator experiment seems to have

182
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,878
reanimated one of the dead metas
in our morgue.

183
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,380
Reanimated? Like, brought back to life?

184
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,291
Life-ish. You ever seen The Walking Dead?

185
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,551
It's The Walking Dead
but without higher brain function

186
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,337
and with major rage issues.

187
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,255
Still unsure if our brains
are on the menu, though.

188
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,174
- Which one?
- Tony Woodward.

189
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,472
The bully from school
who turned into the metal man?

190
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,062
That's not good, Cisco.

191
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:29,860
"History repeats itself, first as tragedy,
and then as farce."

192
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,449
Wells, as a parent, believe me,

193
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,530
I have nothing but sympathy
for what you're going through.

194
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,496
Listen to me closely when I say to you,

195
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,781
we got a lot of fires
burning at the same time,

196
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,325
and if we all work together

197
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,243
we just might be able to put them out.

198
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,921
Let Henry take care of your daughter.

199
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,958
Me and Iris will handle
this Girder situation.

200
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,092
But you and Cisco are the scientists.

201
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,753
You're the only one
who can bring Barry back

202
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,546
from wherever the hell he is right now.

203
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,139
Ramon.

204
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,638
Give those medical records to Henry

205
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,223
and meet me in the Breach Room
in five minutes.

206
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,146
We've got work to do.

207
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,601
Now we just need to find Tony.

208
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,228
Yeah, hopefully, before he kills someone.

209
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,189
Come on.

210
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,665
Big Belly Burger in Starling City
is way better.

211
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,174
This place sucks.

212
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,301
- Oh, my God! ls that your car?
- Oh, yeah.

213
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,311
That's my mom's car!

214
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,825
So how do we know
that this is safe?

215
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,489
Well, define safe.

216
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,700
Safe. As in, my brain's not gonna melt.

217
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,456
No, it's a simple feedback loop, Ramon...

218
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,992
All right? When you vibe on Barry,

219
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,081
your brainwaves send me the necessary data

220
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,872
to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket
or corner of the universe

221
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,210
that Barry is stuck in.

222
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,844
And then we electrically stimulate
your prefrontal cortex

223
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,676
while opening a breach
which gives you physical access to Barry

224
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,216
and let you be the beacon

225
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,094
to guide him home. Simple feedback loop.

226
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,847
I'm sorry, did you say,
"Electrically stimulate"?

227
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,567
Ramon, do you want to
bring Barry back or not?

228
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,189
Okay-

229
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,872
And we have a lock.

230
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,330
I don't understand.

231
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,088
If I'm The Flash, then why are you
doing this to me?

232
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,430
Why do I have to catch this thing
before you let me go back?

233
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,550
Please, look, I will do whatever you want,

234
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,436
just let me go back right now
so I can help my friends.

235
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,604
Barry!

236
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,068
Barry, turn around!

237
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,739
Barry!

238
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,738
What is that?

239
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,407
What is that?

240
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,625
Those are your friends.

241
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,627
They want you to come back.

242
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,926
Can I?

243
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,674
Of course.

244
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,474
But if you do,
it'll be without your powers.

245
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,440
Take my hand!

246
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,112
Do it, take my hand!

247
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,279
The choice is yours, Barry.

248
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,463
Barry!

249
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,984
What is going on in here?

250
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,486
Just hang on a little longer,
Ramon, a little longer.

251
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,314
Hey, you're killing him.

252
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,369
Cisco.

253
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,201
Hey, Cisco, can you hear me?

254
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,330
Yeah. lsaw him.

255
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,995
Barry, he turned to me...

256
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,133
I'm sorry. I lost him.

257
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,177
No.

258
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,016
Whoa, Cisco's meta-human
alert app is going crazy.

259
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,607
Oh, Tonyjust trashed
the hell out of Jitters.

260
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,359
Now, that is strange.

261
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,200
He knocks over a hydrant
on Fourth and Stevenson,

262
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,451
doesn't go in the building.

263
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,830
Then smashes a Humvee
in front of the Big Belly Burger

264
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,414
but doesn't go in the building.

265
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,371
Gets to CC Jitters, he actually goes in.

266
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,874
Yeah, it's like Jitters was his target.
But why?

267
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,999
When I was in Iron Heights awaiting trial,

268
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,339
I had a cellmate who always swore
he was gonna break out.

269
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,137
At a pre-trial hearing
he stole a deputy's gun

270
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,048
and escaped in a police cruiser.

271
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,761
- There's a point to this, Joe, I promise.
- Mmm-hmm.

272
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,347
Now, the poor, dumb bastard
could have gone anywhere, right?

273
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,389
But he was apprehended two hours later.
Do you know why?

274
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,024
'Cause he went to his
old girlfriend's house looking for her.

275
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,436
So you think that's what Tony's doing?
Even in the state he's in now?

276
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,113
Ithink people
are creatures of habit.

277
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,241
Sometimes at a level stronger
than conscious thought.

278
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,742
No, ldon'tthinkthat
Tony had a girlfriend.

279
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,903
I mean, not the way that he was
hitting on me when he...

280
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,956
He came in to Jitters.

281
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,750
- Huh.
- He's after me. Again.

282
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,038
So, when he was after you
the first time,

283
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,414
where'd you see him next? After Jitters.

284
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,376
Home.

285
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,678
He came to our house when he took you.

286
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,129
Wally's there now.

287
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,764
No, no, Dad. This is good.

288
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,721
We know where he is
and we know what he wants.

289
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,635
That means we know how to beat him.

290
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,432
How do you propose we do that?

291
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,519
We use me as bait to lure him
back to S.T.A.R. Labs

292
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,684
where Cisco and Wells can kill him.

293
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,394
Again.

294
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,655
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

295
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,586
Who're you pretending to be now?

296
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,305
I don't have time for this.

297
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,056
Yes, you do, Barry.

298
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,636
You have all the time in the universe.

299
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,138
- Literally.
- No, I don't.

300
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,600
And how can you stand there in judgment
and accuse me of rejecting my gift?

301
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,568
D0 you have any idea how much I've done

302
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,853
since I was first struck by lightning?

303
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,689
How many people I've helped
with the power that you gave me?

304
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,400
What I've sacrificed?

305
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,485
Of course, we do.

306
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,284
You've saved countless lives.

307
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,837
And now you are the only thing
standing in between

308
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,295
your world and unspeakable evil.

309
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,258
And yet, for all of that,
you've never been here.

310
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,068
I can't believe he's coming here.

311
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,028
- Oh, Wally, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

312
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,986
Wait.

313
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,579
I've been meaning to ask you, uh...

314
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,366
How are you feeling?

315
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,078
Uh, tired, but fine, I guess.

316
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,920
So, you don't notice anything different?

317
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,839
Uh, no.

318
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,388
I mean, I want you to know that you can
come talk to me if you're scared,

319
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,432
or you have questions about
how your body is changing...

320
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,930
Oh...

321
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,566
I think you're a little late
forthe puberty talk, Dad.

322
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,477
I've seen the Internet.

323
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,693
Looks like I'm going to have to do this
the old fashioned way.

324
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,243
Are you okay?

325
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,713
Wally, go upstairs.
Please, go upstairs now.

326
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,460
Dad, do you really think
that he's a meta-human?

327
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,253
Well, he got zapped by the
Particle Accelerator

328
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,796
and he was unconscious.
It was worth a shot.

329
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,431
I gave you that mug.

330
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,595
He's coming.

331
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,064
- You sure about this?
- You know what?

332
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,225
Two minutes ago I would've said,
"Yes, absolutely."

333
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,611
But now? What the hell.

334
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,033
Tony! Hey!

335
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,244
Come on, over here.

336
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,792
- You getting towards S.T.A.R. Labs?
- On my way.

337
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,419
I'll meet you there.

338
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,472
Wally, stay here, I'll be right back!

339
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,724
Why did you bring me here?

340
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,229
Your mother's death
happened to you, Barry.

341
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,444
It made you who you are
but have you accepted it?

342
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,320
Really accepted losing her?

343
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,993
Maybe that's why you couldn't come here.

344
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,159
Because that would make it real.

345
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,700
I know it's real.

346
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,286
Every day I know it.

347
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,754
I had a chance to save her.

348
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,500
You saw what I chose.

349
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,012
And you're at peace with that decision?

350
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,424
At peace.

351
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,396
How could someone ever be at peace
with letting his mother die?

352
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,528
With deciding that his life
was more valuable than hers?

353
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,500
Do you really think your mother
would have wanted you to die for her?

354
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,252
Anol all the people The Flash saved
as a result of that decision.

355
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,383
What about them?

356
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,796
Do their lives have value, too?

357
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,433
I don't have to listen to this.

358
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,598
I have to get home.

359
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,655
- Cisco.
- Is iZombie still behind you?

360
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,077
Good news is...

361
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,750
- We lured Tony back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Yeah.

362
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,082
Bad news is we lured Tony back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

363
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,417
No, no, no, this is good.

364
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,047
Okay, uh, side note,

365
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,549
you both might wanna be
on this side of the room,

366
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,960
especially if you're wearing any jewelry

367
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,127
or you have any metal plates in your body?

368
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,253
- Huh?
- Excuse me?

369
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,717
The stray energy from the Accelerator

370
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,261
reactivated Girder's brain,
well, parts of it, anyway.

371
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,472
So, I disassembled our MRI machine

372
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,728
to set up these electromagnets.

373
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,604
So, when Girder walks through that door,

374
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,515
and gets caught in the field
that they generate,

375
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,026
it should disrupt the energy wave
that turned him Abby Normal.

376
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,357
- Like wiping a hard drive.
- Rah-kah-tah!

377
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,365
Okay, now I can only maintain full power
for a few seconds,

378
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,825
so I can't actually turn this on
until he's in the room.

379
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,377
There he is. Hi.

380
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,050
Why don't it look like it's working?
Because it's not.

381
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,551
Uh, let's get out of here?

382
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,109
This is the safest place for her, for now.

383
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,066
- Well, not safe enough.
- Plans A through G did not work.

384
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,954
Do we have anything in here
that can stop him?

385
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,739
Barry could stop him,
ifwe could bring him back.

386
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,829
- We tried that already, Dr. Allen.
- We need to try it again.

387
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,837
Somebody needs to try something,
that door's not gonna hold.

388
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,034
Mom?

389
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,165
Hi, Barry.

390
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,548
You're not my mother.

391
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,759
Why are you doing this to me?

392
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,553
We're not doing anything
to you, sweetheart.

393
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,723
You're just so tired.

394
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,356
Sit, Barry. Sit.

395
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,705
You were right all along,
I haven't accepted it.

396
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,499
Not for a second.

397
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,423
I don't think I ever will.

398
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,631
My beautiful boy.

399
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,551
You have to find a way.

400
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,762
- How?
- I don't know.

401
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,182
But I know this.

402
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,438
What you've become?

403
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,353
It's wonderful...

404
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,484
A miracle, even.

405
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,571
But it won't make bad things
stop happening to you.

406
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,529
Even The Flash can't outrun the tragedies

407
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,447
the universe is gonna keep
sending your way.

408
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,786
You have to accept that.

409
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,827
And then you can truly run free.

410
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,789
I know.

411
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,967
I just miss her.

412
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,678
I miss you so much.

413
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,594
What if I told you that
she's proud of you...

414
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,689
And of the man that you've become?

415
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,934
Who's telling me that?

416
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,945
The Speed Force or my mother?

417
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,814
Both.

418
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,674
Is there any other way out of here?

419
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,588
No, the Breach Room
was designed to be sealed off.

420
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,887
All right, look, if it's me that he wants,

421
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,343
- I'll just lead him away.
- No, you won't.

422
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,765
You'll never even make it past that door.

423
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,396
If he came back from the dead
and still wants you,

424
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,056
what makes you think
he's gonna let you go now?

425
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,349
Wait.

426
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,853
I saw Barry, he had this look.

427
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,235
What if we couldn't get him
out of the Speed Force

428
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,650
because he didn't wanna come back?

429
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,362
Do you remember this book?
It was always your favorite.

430
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,041
"Once, there was a little dinosaur
called a Maiasaur

431
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,497
"who lived with his mother.

432
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,207
"One day he told his mother,

433
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,082
"'l wish I were special
like the other dinosaurs.

434
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,926
"'If I were a T-Rex, I could chomp
with my ferocious teeth."'

435
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,846
"'But if you were a T-Rex, '
said his mother,"

436
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,509
"'How would you hug me
with your tiny little arms?'"

437
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,391
"'I wish I were an Apatosaurus, '
said the little dinosaur,

438
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,482
"'so with my long neck
I could see high above the treetops."'

439
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,731
"'But if you were an Apatosaurus, '
said his mother,"

440
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,902
"'How would you hear me in the treetops
when I told you I love you?"

441
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:27,122
"'What makes you so special,
little Maiasaur?' said his mother,

442
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,586
"'Is it your ferocious teeth,

443
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,255
"'or long neck, or pointy beak."

444
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,296
"'What makes you special"

445
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,221
"'is out of all of the different dinosaurs
in the big wide world,"

446
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,509
"'you have the mother
who is just right for you."

447
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,937
- "'And who will always love you."'
- "'Love you."'

448
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,022
You're ready.

449
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,978
Turn it on.

450
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,434
We got to try again.

451
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,068
- Any of you got a better idea?
- When you look into the Speed Force,

452
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,444
can someone else see into it, too?

453
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,314
Well, as long as you're in
physical contact with Ramon

454
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,701
while he's vibing, then, yes.

455
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,363
Let me do that.
I can get Barry to come back.

456
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,623
No.

457
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,994
Let me do it. Please?

458
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,510
Iris...

459
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,536
Barry.

460
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,089
Barry, come home to me.

461
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,314
Run, Barry, run.

462
00:32:54,338 --> 00:33:02,338
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

463
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,973
Barry.

464
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,559
Barry.

465
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,439
I am so glad you're back
'cause we're about to die.

466
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,607
Wait, what?

467
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,241
So...

468
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,031
- Girder...
- Girder came back to life

469
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,411
and he's all Young Frankenstein now

470
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,948
and he only recognizes Iris
and she lured him to my workshop

471
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,208
so we could demagnetize him
but the machine shorted out

472
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,619
so he's about to come through that door

473
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,958
and smoosh us all into chunky salsa
and possibly eat our brains.

474
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,872
- I don't know, thejury's still 0ut...
- All right, I got it. Uh...

475
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,632
I will lure him to your workshop
and we figure out a way

476
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,004
to turn the power back on, okay?

477
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,634
Plan H.

478
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,781
Hey, Tony!

479
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,655
- He's taking him the long way.
- Come on.

480
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,502
I hope you're ready, he's almost here.

481
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,753
- Nope, not ready.
- No.

482
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,836
Power needs of these two electromagnets,
too much for this wiring to handle.

483
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,838
We're gonna need a really big
extension cord.

484
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,049
All right, I'll see what I can do.

485
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,028
Barry!

486
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,533
Tony.

487
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,449
Tony, look,
you were never my favorite person...

488
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,787
But let's end this,
so you can finally rest.

489
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,886
- He's using spin to charge the magnets.
- Like an electric turbine.

490
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,409
Sorry, I got lost.

491
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,792
It's okay. We found you.

492
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,089
Barry.

493
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,633
You should rest,
you don't need to be here.

494
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,057
No, that's just it. I think I do.

495
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,027
Hey.

496
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,165
How did I get here?

497
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,633
How did you do that?

498
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,059
Are you, like, magic now?

499
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,187
Did you know that was gonna happen?

500
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,976
Maybe. It's hard to explain. It's...

501
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,645
It's the Speed Force.

502
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,906
It's been quite a day, huh?

503
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,618
Not so much "one damn thing after another"

504
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,003
as "every damn thing all at once."

505
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,623
It all worked out okay in the end.

506
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,542
No, you worked it out okay in the end.

507
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,836
It's funny,

508
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,922
I never really understood

509
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,512
where you were coming from
with your whole fate

510
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,723
and "everything happens for a reason"
point of view.

511
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,183
But now...

512
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,602
I think that maybe I was wrong.

513
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,770
Everything that's happened to us,

514
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,658
good and bad, it made us who we are.

515
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,201
And I don't think that I would change it,
even if I could.

516
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,000
- Does that make any sense?
- Perfect sense.

517
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,876
And since we're on the subject

518
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,384
of changing our minds
about important things...

519
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,713
You know that part where I told you
I was gonna leave Central City

520
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,974
so that you could be The Flash without
being concerned about me all the time?

521
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,888
Well, forget all that.

522
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,852
You're stuck with me.

523
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,059
I'm not going anywhere.

524
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,743
Joe offered to take me, so many times.

525
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,872
I always found an excuse to say no.

526
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,919
My mom and I read this when I was little.

527
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,556
- Do you know it?
- Yeah.

528
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,931
I never really liked that book.

529
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,102
Why?

530
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,888
Because it was about a mother

531
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,433
who was always there for her child,
no matter what.

532
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,148
And that wasn't my mom.

533
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,108
Or yours.

534
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,776
We never had anyone who was
just right for us.

535
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,491
Didn't we?

536
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,496
I'm seeing things a lot differently now.

537
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,674
I wasted so much time

538
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,302
Being angry about what I had lost
when I had so much.

539
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,929
My dad,

540
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,719
Joe,

541
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,675
and you.

542
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,472
The truth is, Iris, that I don't know
what this is between us.

543
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,810
Or where we go from here.

544
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,233
All I know is

545
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,107
you're everything to me
and you always have been.

546
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,698
And the sound of your voice
will always bring me home.

547
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,878
- Cait, please.
- I asked you not to call me that.

548
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,425
Caitlin.

549
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,971
We've been through this again and again,
and we've gotten nowhere.

550
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,258
Now I need to know,
are you with me or are you against me?

551
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,802
Don't answer that yet.

552
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,814
I'm gonna go out there,

553
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,566
spend a moment speaking to my friends,

554
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,443
and when I come back
you'll give me your answer.

555
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,856
If you're still here,
I'll know you've chosen to stay with me.

556
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,073
But if you're not here,

557
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,028
I'll know you've chosen
your friends instead.

558
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,000
And I will show you exactly as much mercy

559
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,503
as I will show them
when we next see each other.

560
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,249
So, there you have it.

561
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,382
I need to go.

562
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,820
My brothers and sisters.

563
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,982
My friends.

564
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,365
I've brought us to this new world,

565
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,078
which lay before us defenseless,

566
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,626
ours for the taking.

567
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:40,878
The humans think
that this planet belongs to them.

568
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,295
- Whose world is this?
- Our world!

569
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:53,319
