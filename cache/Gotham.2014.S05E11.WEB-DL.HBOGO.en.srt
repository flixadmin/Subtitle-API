1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,080
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,600
General Wade's landing craft docked.
His convoy's on the way here now.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,640
Reunification day is today.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,760
- Captain Gordon.
- General.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,120
Welcome to Gotham.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,360
Incoming! Get back!

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
- Eduardo. What did Walker do to you?
- Eduardo's dead, Jim.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,040
There is only Bane now.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,200
Everything I have done here
is about punishing Gotham

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,800
for the sins of Bruce Wayne.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm not leaving.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,200
And I don't think
I can let you leave either.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,560
What are you doing?

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,680
Ra's al Ghul.
This is revenge for his death.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
- And who am I?
- You're his daughter.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,760
- Barbara Kean.
- Run!

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,040
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.
I believe you knew my father.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,320
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
But she's planning on using
the military to wipe out Gotham.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,360
I can order them to stand down.
Now let's get you out of here.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,440
This is General Wade.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,360
- Begin your bombing run on my order.
- Wait, wait.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,880
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Back.

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,880
We need to get a hold of Barbara.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,520
Nyssa al Ghul is coming for her.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,880
The sooner she and Lee get back
here with the baby, the better.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
We've got refugees coming in
from all over Gotham, Jim.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,000
People are scared.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,120
I know you're not one to quit
but if there's ever a time

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,280
to wave the white flag, now is it.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,160
Nyssa al Ghul doesn't wanna
just conquer Gotham.

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,760
She wants to destroy it,
kill everyone she finds.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,440
The only thing standing between her
and these people is us.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,440
Gather the team.

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
Get every able-bodied refugee down
to the bunkers beneath the GCPD.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,160
Why do I get the feeling
he's concocting

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,440
an elaborate plan
to get us all killed?

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,560
You better gather up these refugees.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
Look at him.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,880
The medics did everything
they could to stabilize him.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Now all we can do is wait.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
This is my fault.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,960
I sent him on this mission.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Alfred knew what
he was signing up for, Bruce.

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
We all did.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,520
Nyssa and Bane are coming
after me and Barbara.

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,040
Coming after Gotham.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Because of what we did to Ra's.

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,280
What you did was stop him.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
Twice.

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
We'll stop his psycho daughter
together.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sure you recognize this knife.

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,840
You touch my baby

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,400
and I will turn you into a pile
of ash just like I did your father.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,000
A bit cruel, don't you think?

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,320
Don't let this little one
get too attached

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,320
when you won't be around much longer.

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Soon, you and Bruce Wayne

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,560
will see Gotham and Jim Gordon's
precious Green Zone destroyed.

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Then I'll allow you to die.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,680
My father made his name
destroying empires.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
Now it's my turn.

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
- Hello.
- Listen to me.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,520
There was this submarine in the docks
full of Gotham's gold. It's yours.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Just leave the city.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,440
Let me and my baby go.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
No.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,120
I think I'll keep this little one
and raise her as my own...

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,040
as an al Ghul.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,880
- I take it the army has landed.
- They're just awaiting my orders.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
Then what are you waiting for?

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,480
Cute little baby.

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
Wait, what?

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,560
You're ordering us to destroy
the Green Zone?

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Anyone still in Gotham
is an enemy of the state.

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
I won't be party to the murder
of civilians, General.

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Then you're relieved of command.

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
Who the hell are you?

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm your new commander.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,760
Does anybody else have a problem
with the General's orders?

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Good. Let's get started.

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
{\an5}What's the matter?

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,600
{\an5}Can we really be so cavalier
about the destruction of Gotham?

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,640
{\an5}Let me think about that.

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Yes!

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
{\an5}- Darn it!
- Oswald.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,000
{\an5}Where are you going? Oswald.

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,960
{\an5}This is my city and I will be damned

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
{\an5}if I'm gonna let those
bastards take it.

90
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,680
I cannot let you do this.

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,920
{\an5}You of all people should wanna
stop those monsters.

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,920
{\an5}They forced you to destroy Haven,

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,040
{\an5}to murder hundreds
of innocent civilians.

94
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
{\an5}You're just gonna let them
get away with it?

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,760
{\an5}I was kind of planning on it, yeah.

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,680
{\an5}Very well.

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
{\an5}I'm going to follow my heart.

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
{\an5}Oswald!

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
{\an5}You have been down this road before.

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,280
{\an5}Following your heart
has never worked out for you.

101
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,440
Perhaps.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,160
{\an5}But perhaps you could learn something

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,760
{\an5}if you listen to this
instead of this.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,240
{\an5}I'm gonna miss you, Edward.

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
{\an5}I'll miss you too, Oswald.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,880
{\an5}I'm not talking to you.

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm talking to the...

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,120
God!

109
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,320
{\an5}Come on, baby.

110
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,640
{\an5}Okay. Good boy.

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Go with the man in green.

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,200
You'll be safe.

113
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Oswald?

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,320
If you walk off this dock,
I'm taking the submarine.

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,680
And the treasure!

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Nyssa al Ghul wants to kill
everyone in Gotham.

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,520
But to get to us, the army
has to follow the western corridor.

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
That's where we'll make a stand.

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
We got a handful of men.
How are we gonna take on an army?

120
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,760
We just have to slow the army
down long enough

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
to get General Wade out
from under Nyssa's control.

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
Then he can reverse
the invasion order.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,480
We're trying to reach the Sirens.
Still no luck.

124
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,240
- All right. I'll go.
- Jim.

125
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
I need to get Barbara
and Lee back here.

126
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,240
I'll meet you at the barricades.

127
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,760
I know you haven't seen your kid yet
but the GCPD needs a leader

128
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
and they're looking to you.

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
I'll go to Sirens.

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
Okay.

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,960
You sure you wanna do this?

132
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,960
It doesn't take the two of us
to track the General's signal.

133
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,440
And if Jim's making a stand,
that's where I should be.

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Okay.

135
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Wayne Enterprise's EMP,
smoke bombs, signal jammers.

136
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,640
Not enough to even the odds
but it may buy you some time.

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
What's this?

138
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,360
You remember the Nightwing Project?

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,840
Portable, next-gen stealth tech.

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,120
Put it on any aircraft
and it's invisible to radar,

141
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,720
but unfortunately,
it also seems to serve

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,920
as a beacon to certain animals.

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,640
You never know.
Might find a use for it.

144
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Oswald, come in.

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,840
You still have those eyes
in the back of your head, Jim.

146
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
No.

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,320
You just have a remarkably
recognizable odor.

148
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Part dandy, part snake.

149
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,760
For all these years,
it hasn't changed.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,360
Drink?

151
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
No, thank you.

152
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
It dulls the senses.

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
That's what I was going for.

154
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,360
Surprised you're still here.
I figured you'd be long gone by now.

155
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,080
That storm you've warned me about
for so long, it's finally here.

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,080
We've shared some turbulent times,
you and I.

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,440
That we have.

158
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
When you spared my life
on the pier that day,

159
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
banished me from Gotham,

160
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
that was the most lost
I've ever been.

161
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,720
Because I was away
from the city, you see.

162
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
It's part of me.

163
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,480
You know what I'm talking about
because it's part of you too.

164
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,440
Sure, I could escape with money,
I might add but then what?

165
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,040
Stand on the shores of the mainland

166
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
and watch the army burn it
to the ground?

167
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,800
Then watch tasteless industrialists
and vapid politicians rebuild it?

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,040
No.

169
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,320
My life is etched
on the walls of every alley

170
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,160
and dirty warehouse here.

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,720
My blood lives
in its broken concrete.

172
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm staying to fight.

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
- For my legacy.
- Hey.

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,760
The army just busted through
the GCPD checkpoint.

175
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,360
They're heading to the barricades.
Bane's leading them.

176
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,160
- How many men?
- Six, 700.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,520
Still wanna fight?

178
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
- How many do we have?
- Maybe 30?

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,240
Thirty-one.

180
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
It takes two men to pilot
that submarine, Oswald.

181
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
The dog can't do it.

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Ditto on that blood
and concrete thing.

183
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,960
I kind of like this city
the way it is.

184
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,160
Shall we?

185
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,480
I believe time is of the essence.

186
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Gentlemen?

187
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
Remind me to talk to you
about that full pardon.

188
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,560
Alvarez, Harper, Bruce,
take the left flank.

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,280
Harvey and I will take the right.

190
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Holy Mary Mother and Joseph.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Captain Gordon.

192
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I always knew you had
savior complex,

193
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,480
but this is too much.

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,680
What happened to you, Eduardo?

195
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,400
There was a time when you would've
been up on these barricades with me.

196
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Yes.

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,760
But that was before
I found my true purpose.

198
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,040
Stand by.

199
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Fire on my command.

200
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,920
Jim, there's a lot of innocent
soldiers down there

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,360
just following orders.

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Target Bane and Nyssa's commandos.

203
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,440
Fire on my command.

204
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,680
For Gotham.

205
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Lee?

206
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,840
- Selina.
- Hey.

207
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,760
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

208
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
Where's Barbara and the baby?

209
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
Nyssa al Ghul took them.

210
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,640
- We have to tell Jim.
- Yeah.

211
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
The Narrows.

212
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,520
They never stood a chance.

213
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,040
The ones who could
escape to the GCPD...

214
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,200
Then that's where I'm needed.

215
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,840
Target Jim Gordon.

216
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh, I'm sorry,

217
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,360
I don't think he can hear you
through the bullet in his ear!

218
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,240
Eddie!

219
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,360
They're only delaying the inevitable.

220
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,520
Jim, that thing's pointing
right at us!

221
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,520
Go, go, go!

222
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,200
Find me, Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,040
If the army gets to the barricades,
they'll have a straight shot

224
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,600
to the GCPD and the people there.

225
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
We need to find another way
to slow them down.

226
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
I think I have a way.

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,920
Gather all the ammunition you can,
fall back to the GCPD!

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,560
Go, go, now!

229
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
We gotta go.

230
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
Well, that was a disaster.

231
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,680
Come on, Oswald,
we have to keep moving.

232
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Where? There is nowhere to hide, Jim.

233
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Wherever we go,
the army will find us.

234
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
<i>- Get me Gordon.</i>
- It's Lucius.

235
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Tell me you were able to track
the General's signal.

236
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,840
It's coming from City Hall
but there's a problem.

237
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,560
Selina radioed.

238
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,280
<i>Barbara and the baby
were kidnapped by Nyssa al Ghul.</i>

239
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,520
If General Wade is at City Hall,
chances are Nyssa,

240
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Barbara and the baby are too.

241
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,960
Our best bet is for me
to sneak into City Hall alone.

242
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,480
One good electrical zap should
short out the General's chip,

243
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
then you can get them
to reverse the invasion order.

244
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,960
See you back at the GCPD.

245
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,720
Get Barbara and the baby back safe.

246
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Come on.

247
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Hey, move!

248
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,080
Upsy-daisy, Oswald.

249
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,720
- We're running out of time.
- Just give me one minute.

250
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,520
- Oh, God.
- I'm so sorry.

251
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
I saw the grenade and I froze. I'm...

252
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,960
It's the least I could do.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
But tell me...

254
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
does it look bad?

255
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,040
No, it's just a...

256
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
It looks fine. Let's go.

257
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,200
Where did everybody go?

258
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,320
She's gonna need some morphine.

259
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
And his bandage needs changing.

260
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Lee!

261
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,640
- Bruce, is Jim...
- He's okay, for now.

262
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
We need to get Jeremiah's battery
from the basement.

263
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,240
After the bridges went down,
Lucius remodified Jeremiah's bomb

264
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,080
to be used for its original purpose.

265
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
As a battery.

266
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,920
It's been powering the GCPD.

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
Right.

268
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,600
We need to make it a bomb again.

269
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,680
You gotta be kidding me.

270
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,160
Jeremiah knew exactly
where to put his bombs

271
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,440
to topple buildings and turn
Gotham into a maze.

272
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,720
We stopped him.

273
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
But if we can use
just part of his plan,

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,880
we can trap the army
and slow them down.

275
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
By knocking buildings down
like dominoes.

276
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,400
But for that to work, we need
to put a bomb in this building.

277
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
Ground zero for the blast.

278
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,000
Wayne Enterprises.

279
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,200
Bruce?

280
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
There's no other way.

281
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Okay.

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,280
How do we get this thing out of here?

283
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,040
To use it as a bomb,
we don't need the whole thing.

284
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,880
All you need is the core...

285
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
and the activator.

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,520
That's it?

287
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,040
It may look modest
but all it took is one of these

288
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
to blow up an entire bridge,

289
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,280
not to mention
the Gotham Clock Tower.

290
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,200
- Bruce, you can't do this alone.
- He's not alone.

291
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
I know where to place the bomb.

292
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,000
And you and Lucius are needed here.

293
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,600
I can't believe
we're letting them do this.

294
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
Well, add that to the list of things
that I cannot believe are happening.

295
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,520
- Hey.
- What?

296
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,880
The key is there.

297
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
Where is she? Is she okay?

298
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,320
Yeah, she's upstairs in the office
with Nyssa and the General.

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,200
Nyssa is not gonna stop until
she's killed everyone in Gotham.

300
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,400
One thing at a time.
Let's go save our baby.

301
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
Hello, Captain Gordon.

302
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,200
You're seeing your baby
for the first time.

303
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,960
I wish I had a camera.

304
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
- Hand her over.
- No.

305
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't think I will.

306
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
Put down your guns.

307
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,520
Unless you want the little one
hurt in the crossfire.

308
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Even now, the army is making
its way to the Green Zone

309
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,240
while Bane is hunting down
Bruce Wayne.

310
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,600
Only question is,
what to do with you?

311
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
This is it.

312
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,120
The bomb will weaken
the support column

313
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
and topple the entire building.

314
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,000
This is crazy.

315
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,040
We've spent this entire time
trying to stop Jeremiah,

316
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,440
and now we're actually using
part of his plan?

317
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
Believe me...

318
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,880
if there was any other way...

319
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,720
You sure you wanna do this?

320
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,720
First, Wayne Manor gets destroyed
and now Wayne Enterprises.

321
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
This building is the heart
of my family's company.

322
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,680
There are things above us my parents
spent their entire lives on.

323
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
Some of my earliest memories
are playing with Alfred in this lobby

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
waiting for my parents
to get down these escalators.

325
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,720
But my parents built this company
to make Gotham a better place.

326
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,720
They would've sacrificed
everything for this city.

327
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
They did sacrifice everything.

328
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,240
And if that's what it takes...

329
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,080
so will I.

330
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,120
So remind me how this works?

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,120
Pulls energy from the air
and magnifies it.

332
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,960
- And when it does that?
- We run!

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,920
I knew you would come for your child.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,240
I just didn't think you'd be foolish
enough to come alone.

335
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,360
I don't need help to take you down.

336
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,680
Don't you see?

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
It's over.

338
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Gotham will burn

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,480
and I'll achieve
what my father couldn't.

340
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Including killing you.

341
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,800
She likes to be held upright.

342
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,040
Barbara, I'll deal with you once
Gotham has been destroyed,

343
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,760
but I'd like you to see this.

344
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,720
I was expecting a little more gusto.

345
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,200
You want gusto?

346
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,840
Is that all you got?

347
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
It's Lieutenant Angel.

348
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,960
- They did what?
- No. No.

349
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Is there another way around?

350
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,120
Then tell the army to blast through.

351
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,160
Hey, I'm not done with you yet.

352
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,800
Your friends may have
bought you some time,

353
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
but the Green Zone's
destruction is only delayed.

354
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,960
And now, to meet your fate.

355
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,480
Let's meet it together.

356
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,440
Barbara!

357
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,080
You think you can defeat me?

358
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,680
Better men and women
have tried and failed.

359
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,120
I am an al Ghul.
You'll never beat me.

360
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,040
I have my father's blood in my veins.
I am his one true heir.

361
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Do you ever stop talking?

362
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
You two do share one thing.

363
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,760
You both love getting
stabbed by this knife.

364
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
General Wade...

365
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,040
execute fail-safe.

366
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,280
No.

367
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,960
I'm going to enjoy watching
Gotham be destroyed.

368
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
And then, my legacy will be complete.

369
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,880
We gotta hurry.

370
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,160
It's only a matter of time
before the army breaks through.

371
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,960
We need to get back to the GCPD.

372
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,720
Bruce!

373
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,040
Impressive.

374
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,600
You blow up your father's
building to stop the military.

375
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
It'll take more to stop me.

376
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,000
- Go on ahead, Selina, warn the GCPD!
- No, we're doing this together.

377
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
You shouldn't have hurt Alfred.

378
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,480
Collateral damage. It happens in war.

379
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm sorry you weren't there
to see me break your butler.

380
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,720
But I'm so glad you won't miss me
killing your little friend.

381
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,080
Let her go.

382
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,840
In war, there are no attachments.

383
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Only then can you fight
without your hands tied.

384
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
You see,

385
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,280
just a little ounce of pressure.

386
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,040
That's all that separates
the living from the dead.

387
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,120
- What is that?
- Wayne cloaking device.

388
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,240
But it had some glitches.

389
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,800
Apparently, it's a beacon
for certain winged mammals.

390
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,560
What winged mammals?

391
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,720
Bats.

392
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,680
There's no way to reverse
the invasion order.

393
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
We have to find another way.

394
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,720
- Is she all right?
- She is now.

395
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,960
There, there.

396
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
Mama's here.

397
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
And your father.

398
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,480
Try not to get blood on her.

399
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
- Sir.
- Come on.

400
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
We're almost at the Green Zone.

401
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,200
Lee?

402
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Jim.

403
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,680
- The baby?
- I checked her over. She's fine.

404
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
Though she could use a feed.

405
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,560
Where's General Wade?
The army's broken through.

406
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,040
General Wade's dead.

407
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Nyssa al Ghul escaped.

408
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,600
There's no way to order
the army to stand down.

409
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,880
So now what?

410
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,600
The army blew up Wayne Enterprises
and knocked down two other buildings.

411
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,520
We don't stand a chance.

412
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,640
Actually, that was Bruce and Selina.

413
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,360
- What?
- The army's blocks away.

414
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
- From what direction?
- Every direction.

415
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,560
We're surrounded.

416
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,240
Jim, I need to get her out of here.

417
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
All right.

418
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,880
The tunnels underneath the GCPD,
there's a vent shaft

419
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,520
that connects to a subway line.

420
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,560
Take the baby and the refugees
down to the subways,

421
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,880
get them behind enemy lines.

422
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,800
- Don't stop till you get to safety.
- Okay.

423
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,200
But what about you?

424
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,880
I'll hold them off outside,
buy you some time.

425
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
- Jim...
- These refugees,

426
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
most of them are from the Narrows.

427
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,800
They know you and they trust you.
They know you'll protect them.

428
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,360
Go.

429
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

430
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
Rest, Alfred.

431
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
All this time,
I tried to protect you.

432
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,160
Here you are, a soldier.

433
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,520
A soldier for good.

434
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,520
You've spent your life protecting me.

435
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,600
Now, it's time for me to do the same.

436
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,240
It's time for me to protect Gotham.

437
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Even if there's nothing
left to defend.

438
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
All right, everyone,
let's move, okay?

439
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,400
All right, you'll walk about
five blocks underground,

440
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,520
and then you'll get to a subway vent.

441
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
Go.

442
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,280
Thank you.

443
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,040
You're not coming with us?

444
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,880
Jim and our friends are out there,
making a stand.

445
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
That's where I belong.

446
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

447
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,560
Survive.
Make sure this was all worth it.

448
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,160
Go.

449
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,160
What was that for?

450
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,880
Everything you've done for me.

451
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
And for her.

452
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
Just get them to safety.

453
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,760
It's over, Jim.

454
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Our war has come to an end.

455
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
This isn't a war.

456
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,200
This is a firing squad.

457
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,360
- I told you to go.
- And I didn't listen.

458
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,560
Ready.

459
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,920
Aim...

460
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
Shoulder to shoulder.

461
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,320
- Stand together.
- What the...

462
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
They're here for us, Jim.

463
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,560
Fire.

464
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I said fire!

465
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
You have a choice.

466
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,200
You can stand with us,
or you can stand with them.

467
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,160
Yes!

468
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
We are Gotham!

469
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,360
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

470
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,520
That bitch was telling
the truth after all.

471
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,560
We managed to raise the mainland
on the radio.

472
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
They know everything.

473
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,520
As of right now,
the army is being repurposed

474
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,200
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

475
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,240
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

476
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,600
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

477
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll be damned.

478
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Hey.

479
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
So...

480
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,640
this whole not listening thing,
it's not gonna become a habit, is it?

481
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,920
You're welcome.

482
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,200
Go.

483
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
This is gonna make one hell
of a bedtime story someday.

484
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,440
- Can I?
- Of course.

485
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,400
I don't even know what to call her.

486
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,760
Barbara.

487
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Barbara Lee Gordon.

488
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,840
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

489
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
Bruce, what's wrong?

490
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,760
We won.

491
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Nyssa al Ghul is still out there.

492
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
And she and Bane were right.

493
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
All this happened because of me.

494
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,320
Because people were trying to hurt me
and the people I care about.

495
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
When Bane had you...

496
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,800
I thought he was gonna kill you,
Selina

497
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,280
and there was nothing I could do.

498
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,280
Hey.

499
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,000
I will be here whenever you need me.

500
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,360
What?

501
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,840
That's what my parents
used to tell me.

502
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,560
Come here.

503
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,800
- That bitch stole our submarine!
- And our gold.

504
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,320
And by now she's probably landed
somewhere on the mainland,

505
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,200
impossible to track.

506
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,120
After all we've been through
these last months,

507
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,480
we are once again left with nothing.

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,040
Nothing!

509
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
Back to square one.

510
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,120
Common criminals.

511
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,960
We saved this city
from certain damnation,

512
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,520
but will we see any credit
for our loyalty?

513
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,120
Our selfless bravery? Of course not!

514
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,680
I don't want their thanks.

515
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,840
Or their respect.

516
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,360
You know what I felt

517
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,000
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

518
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,360
Nothing.

519
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,600
I feel...

520
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,840
absolutely nothing for those drab...

521
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,080
boring people.

522
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,400
That was me once.

523
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,840
Minimum wage at a thankless job
at the GCPD.

524
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,320
Yes, sir. No, sir.
Thank you so much, sir.

525
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
Pick up scraps
from my master's floor.

526
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Shy, awkward,

527
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
pathetic.

528
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,200
Ed.

529
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,880
Common criminals.

530
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
Never again.

531
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,360
I've shown this city
who I truly am once before,

532
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,600
and I will do it again.

533
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,080
They will bow to The Riddler,

534
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,760
and they won't get up
until I permit them to.

535
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,560
Yes.

536
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,440
You're right.

537
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,280
Our accomplishments have been erased,

538
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,720
our brilliant minds underrated.

539
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,600
If they had let me run this city
the way I wanted to,

540
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
it would not be in ruins now.

541
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,280
I have the men,
the money, the guns...

542
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,520
Gordon took them.

543
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,760
Why? Because he still sees you
as Fish Mooney's umbrella boy,

544
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,320
and he always will.

545
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,080
Yes.

546
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,440
I only came back to help him
save this city

547
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,840
so that I could take it for myself.

548
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,080
We would be stronger together.

549
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,480
No one could stop us.

550
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,720
Yeah, perhaps.

551
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,840
Let's make a pact.

552
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
Here and now.

553
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,080
We will take what we want
from who we want,

554
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,480
and we will suffer no fools.

555
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
Together.

556
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,920
Shall we shake on that?

557
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
Please.

558
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,240
We're brothers.

559
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,240
A hug.

560
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,600
A hug it is.

561
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,720
Life begins anew.

562
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,400
Shall we head to work?

563
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,600
Thank you all for coming here today.

564
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,120
It is my great honor
to introduce Mayor Chang.

565
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,680
With reunification underway
and the bridges being rebuilt,

566
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,240
it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon

567
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
the title of Commissioner.

568
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,360
We're gonna miss you
around the bullpen.

569
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
I won't be far.

570
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,600
And the mission doesn't change.

571
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,440
Trying to make this city
a better place.

572
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
Be careful.

573
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,360
You're swimming with sharks now.

574
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,840
If you need anything ever...

575
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,240
I know who to call.

576
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
You deserve this, Jim.

577
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,400
You really do.

578
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm gonna go get a drink before
you get all teary-eyed on me.

579
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,520
What do you mean you're leaving?

580
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,120
Bane's in prison. It's over.

581
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,080
My life here...

582
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,560
it's too public.

583
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,840
You've made up your mind.

584
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
Gotham's in good hands.

585
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,960
Commissioner.

586
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,640
Thank you, Bruce

587
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,520
for everything you've done for me
and for the city.

588
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,640
Gotham will always be your home.

589
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,440
Bruce is all grown up.

590
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
That he is.

591
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,920
Well, now you have another
little one to look after.

592
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,360
Where's Bruce?

593
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,240
He left you this.

594
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,200
You know how to reach me,
if you need anything?

595
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Yes.

596
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,240
Well, you know me, Master Bruce so,

597
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,440
I'll be very self-sufficient.

598
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,640
Busy, actually, you know,

599
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,600
we start the reconstruction
of Wayne Enterprises

600
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,040
and Wayne Manor tomorrow.

601
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,040
You'll remember everything
I told you, won't you?

602
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
Of course.

603
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,640
Good. That's...

604
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
that's good.

605
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,680
I never tried to replace
your parents, you know.

606
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,440
I couldn't. I never would.

607
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,000
But I want you to know, Master Bruce,

608
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,080
that you are the only son
that I will ever have.

609
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,000
And I could not be more proud.
