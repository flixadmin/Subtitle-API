1
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,224
Will!

2
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,237
Will!

3
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,857
- Dustin!
- Mrs. Byers?

4
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,735
What's going on? Where's Will?

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,816
The field!

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,742
Will. I just found him like this!

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,494
I think he's having another episode!

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,585
Will! Will! Will!

9
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,415
Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom!

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,384
Will!

11
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,513
Will, wake up!

12
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,806
Can you hear me?

13
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,972
Will, please, just wake up.

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,065
Please, wake up!

15
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,813
It's Mom!

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,482
It's me!

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,268
Okay, that totally freaked me out.

18
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,975
Did that not freak you guys out?

19
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,358
- Two episodes in two days.
- It's getting worse.

20
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,109
You think it's True Sight?

21
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,485
What's True Sight?

22
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,366
It's nothing.

23
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,954
I can't remember.

24
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,707
I need you to try.

25
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,217
I... I was on the field and...
and then it...

26
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,841
it all just went blank, and...
and then you were there.

27
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,346
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.

28
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,222
I am.

29
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,077
This shape, I saw it on the video tape
from Halloween night.

30
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,404
It's the same shape as... as your drawing.

31
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,250
These episodes that you're having,
I think Dr. Owens is wrong.

32
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,668
I think they're real.

33
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,963
But... but I can't help you
if I don't know what's going on.

34
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,008
So, you have to talk to me. Please.

35
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,512
No more secrets, okay?

36
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,017
Okay.

37
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,812
Did... did you see this thing again
on the field?

38
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,068
Yes.

39
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,691
What... what is it?

40
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,821
I don't know.

41
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,076
It's almost
more like a feeling.

42
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,830
Like the one you had
that night at the arcade?

43
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,331
Yes.

44
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,334
What does it want?

45
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,134
I don't know.

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,308
It came for me, and...

47
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,394
Go away!

48
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,723
And I tried. I tried to make it go away.

49
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,438
But it got me, Mom.

50
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,734
Well, what does that mean?

51
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,313
I felt it... everywhere.

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Everywhere.

53
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,072
I... I still feel it.

54
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,656
I just want this to be over.

55
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,208
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

56
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,160
Listen. Look, look at me.

57
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,216
I will never, ever let anything bad
happen to you ever again.

58
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,970
Whatever's going on in you,
we're gonna fix it. I will fix it.

59
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,306
I promise. I'm here.

60
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,011
"Friends don't lie."
Isn't that your bullshit saying?

61
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,813
Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!

62
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,444
Where'd you go
on your little field trip, huh?

63
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,197
Where?

64
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,740
Did you go see Mike?

65
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,661
He didn't see me.

66
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:15,206
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter
did and they called the cops.

67
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,501
Now, did anyone else see you?

68
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,419
Anyone at all?

69
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,246
Come on, I need you to think!

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,423
Nobody saw me!

71
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,381
You put us in danger.

72
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,762
You realize that, right?

73
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,965
You promised...

74
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,013
I go!

75
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,719
And I never leave!

76
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,021
Nothing ever happens!

77
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,441
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!

78
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,403
You lie!

79
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,358
I don't lie!
I protect and I feed and I teach!

80
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,822
And all I ask of you is
that you follow three simple rules.

81
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,998
Three rules. And you know what?

82
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,208
You can't even do that!

83
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,134
You're grounded.

84
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,631
You know what that means?

85
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,430
It means no Eggos...

86
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,143
And no TV for a week.

87
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,773
All right, knock it off. Let go.

88
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,903
Okay.

89
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,575
Two weeks.

90
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,279
Let go!

91
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,866
- A month!
- No!

92
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,085
Well, congratulations.

93
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:48,212
You just graduated from no TV for a month
to no TV at all!

94
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,587
No!

95
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,262
No! No. No!

96
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,888
You have got to understand that
there are consequences to your actions.

97
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,935
You are like Papa!

98
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,228
Really?

99
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,015
I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch?

100
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,151
Wow! All right.
You wanna go back in the lab?

101
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,608
One phone call. I can make that happen.

102
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,234
I hate you.

103
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,236
Yeah, well,
I'm not so crazy about you, either.

104
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,113
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.

105
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,444
You know what that word means?

106
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,576
How about that be your word
for the day, huh? Brat.

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,704
Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T.

108
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,794
Brat.

109
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,299
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,840
Hey!

111
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,134
Hey!

112
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,386
Hey! Hey!

113
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,018
Open this door!

114
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,017
Open the damn door!

115
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,723
You wanna go out in the world?

116
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,399
You better grow up!

117
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,272
Grow the hell up!

118
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,093
Mom?

119
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,590
Will?

120
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,386
Hello?

121
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,638
Do you like those grapes, Holly?

122
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,764
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about
staying the night at Stacey's tonight?

123
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,473
We were gonna have a girl's night.

124
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,275
Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip...

125
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,194
Sure! That sounds like fun.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,069
Toast? No?

127
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

128
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,789
Did you see your mom?

129
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,546
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.

130
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,297
You don't have to do this, you know.

131
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,182
Stop saying that.

132
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,485
- <i>Hawkins Police.</i>
- Flo, it's Joyce again.

133
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,567
<i>Oh, hi, Joyce.
Listen, I gave him your message...</i>

134
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,367
- He's still not there?
<i>- No, but...</i>

135
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,116
Did he get any of my messages
from yesterday? Did you give...

136
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,665
<i>- Yes, do you wanna talk to...</i>
- No, no, I need Hopper.

137
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,166
Just tell him to call me
the second he gets in. Please.

138
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,963
- Thank you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

139
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,547
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead?

140
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,051
- Any better?
- Mmm-mmm.

141
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,384
Same as last night? Still weird?

142
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,558
Yeah.

143
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,307
All right.

144
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,565
Hmm.

145
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,062
Okay, let me see.

146
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,830
Is it a fever?

147
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,038
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.

148
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,413
Do you feel cold?

149
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,122
No. Just a little out of it.

150
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,629
Like I haven't really woken up yet.

151
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,006
You promised no doctor.

152
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,053
And I meant it. No doctor.

153
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,724
You know what?

154
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,221
I'm gonna run you a nice bath
and it'll warm you up

155
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,893
and hopefully get you feeling better.

156
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,016
How's that sound? Okay.

157
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,741
Morning, Dart.

158
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,406
Got you some breakfast.

159
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,867
Your favorite.

160
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,005
I gotta go to school,

161
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,174
but I'll be back soon. Sound good?

162
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,529
Stop being a baby
and do it already!

163
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,073
This is so disgusting.
Is this really necessary?

164
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,911
What the hell's going on?

165
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,114
What do you think? We're looking for Dart.

166
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,749
- Jesus!
- Oh!

167
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,041
Ugh!

168
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,377
Well, well, well.

169
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,750
Look who finally decided to show up.

170
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,675
After I drew the short straw.
Real convenient.

171
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,676
You stink!

172
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,391
Hi, Max.

173
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,226
Hi.

174
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,686
- Where's Will?
- He'll be here.

175
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,479
Are you just gonna stand there?

176
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,231
Or you gonna help?

177
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,568
<i>All living things,
from complex mammals</i>

178
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,822
<i>to single-celled organisms,
instinctively respond to danger.</i>

179
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,863
Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical,
and it will flee.

180
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,540
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.

181
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,044
<i>We're very much the same.</i>

182
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,504
<i>When we encounter danger,
our hearts start pounding.</i>

183
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,716
<i>Our palms start to sweat.</i>

184
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:20,062
<i>These are the signs of the physical
and emotional state we call...</i>

185
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,518
<i>fear.</i>

186
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,074
<i>Hey, you reached Jim.</i>

187
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,153
<i>I'm probably doing something
incredible right now and I can't...</i>

188
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,204
Mom.

189
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,997
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?

190
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,325
It's too hot.

191
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,631
I... I can cool it down
a little bit, baby,

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,929
- but we gotta get your body temp back up.
- No.

193
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,725
What?

194
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,764
He likes it cold.

195
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,296
Hey, kid.

196
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,804
Listen, um...

197
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,725
about last night, I, uh...

198
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,062
I want this place cleaned up
by the time I get back

199
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,361
and then maybe I'll consider
fixing the TV.

200
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,654
You hear me?

201
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,618
<i>Come in, Hop.</i>

202
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,458
<i>Come in, Hop.</i>

203
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,161
<i>Come in, Hop.</i>

204
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,502
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on my way in,

205
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,335
and, yes, I do know what time it is.

206
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,839
<i>Joyce Byers has called
eight times already this morning.</i>

207
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,468
<i>Eight times.</i>

208
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,893
<i>For my sake, please deal with her!</i>

209
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,735
Let's go. Pass it up now.
Get open!

210
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,191
All right! All right, all right!

211
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,651
King Steve. King Steve, everyone.

212
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,577
I like it. Playing tough today.

213
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,325
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking?
Come on!

214
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,951
What?

215
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,705
You afraid the coach is gonna
bench you now that I'm here? Huh?

216
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,631
You were moving your feet.

217
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,964
Plant them next time, draw a charge.

218
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,060
Don't sweat it, Harrington.

219
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,861
Today's just not your day, man.

220
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,940
Yeah. Not your week.

221
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,589
You and the princess break up for one day,

222
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,360
she's running off
with the freak's brother.

223
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,415
Oh, shit. You don't know.

224
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,578
Jonathan and the princess skipped
yesterday. Still haven't shown.

225
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,631
But that must just be
a coincidence, right?

226
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,585
Don't take it too hard, man.

227
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,847
A pretty boy like you has got
nothing to worry about.

228
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,516
Plenty of bitches in the sea.

229
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,978
Am I right?

230
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,358
I'll be sure to leave you some.

231
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,082
It's 15 past.

232
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,704
Yeah, I know.

233
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,412
Just give him time.

234
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,381
That guy. There.

235
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,760
- What?
- He just... just talked to himself.

236
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,488
Duck, duck, duck,

237
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,408
duck, duck...

238
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,038
Duck, duck, duck...

239
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,005
Duck, duck, duck...

240
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,716
Duck...

241
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,092
Duck, duck...

242
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,643
Goose!

243
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,186
I think we should go.

244
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,424
Trouble with your car, miss?
I can give you two a lift if you like.

245
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,680
Jonathan.

246
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,400
You sure you don't need that ride?

247
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,791
Hello?

248
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,341
Leave it open.

249
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,799
Where the hell have you been?

250
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,223
I overslept. What the hell's going on?
It's freezing.

251
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,893
Hey! Knock, knock.

252
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,358
We have a visitor.

253
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,157
So this thing, this shadow thing.

254
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,987
You told your mom it likes it like this.
It likes it cold?

255
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:49,998
Yeah.

256
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,244
How do you know that?

257
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,993
I just know.

258
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,717
Does he talk to you?

259
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,217
No. It's like...

260
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,966
I don't have to think.

261
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,717
I just know things now.

262
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,428
Things I never did before.

263
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,231
And, uh...

264
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,392
what else do you know?

265
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,652
It's hard to explain.

266
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,198
It's like old memories
in the back of my head,

267
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,527
only... they're not my memories.

268
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,404
Okay.

269
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,992
I mean, I don't think
they're old memories at all. They're...

270
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,542
they're now-memories,
happening all at once, now.

271
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,874
Can you describe these now-memories?

272
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,471
I don't know.
It's... it's hard to explain.

273
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,595
I know it's hard
but can you just... Can you try?

274
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,347
For us?

275
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,896
It's like...

276
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,022
They're growing and spreading...

277
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,363
killing.

278
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,275
The memories?

279
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,653
I don't know.

280
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,954
Oh!

281
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,872
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie.

282
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,459
Hey, hey, sweetie...

283
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,717
what if you didn't have to use words?

284
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,707
<i>Hey,
you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...</i>

285
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,751
Anything?

286
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,500
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.

287
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:05,884
Party members only.

288
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,052
Come on, Mike.

289
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,844
No! This is non-negotiable.

290
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,805
- Sorry, Max.
- Sorry.

291
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,348
Will didn't want me to tell anyone,

292
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,935
but on Halloween night
he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.

293
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,854
A shadow?

294
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,563
What kind of shadow?

295
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,398
I don't know. But it scared him.

296
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,155
And if Will really has True Sight...

297
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,453
I mean, if he can really see
into the Upside Down,

298
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,531
maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.

299
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,083
- So that's why he was frozen like that?
- Maybe.

300
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,170
Can it hurt him?

301
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,997
I mean, if this shadow thing
isn't from our world...

302
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,752
I'm not sure. Dustin?

303
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,208
Well, if you're in another plane,

304
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,134
you can't interact
with the material plane,

305
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,303
so theoretically,
no, the shadow can't hurt him.

306
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,005
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.

307
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,682
This isn't D & D. This is real life.

308
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,769
So what do we do?

309
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,560
We acquire more knowledge.

310
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,139
I'll go to Will's after school.
See what's going on.

311
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,552
You guys stay here and find Dart.

312
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,316
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?

313
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,938
Will heard him in the Upside Down.

314
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,443
I don't know how yet,
but he's gotta be connected to all this.

315
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,613
He's gotta be.

316
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,780
If we find Dart,
maybe we can solve this thing.

317
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,199
Maybe we can help Will.

318
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,694
<i>Hey! Hey, assholes!</i>

319
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,820
Let us out of here!

320
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,865
Oh!

321
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,830
Not very pleasant in here, is it?

322
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:29,127
Sorry about that.
Hospitality's not our strong suit.

323
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,125
You know, scientists and all.

324
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,300
Yeah. Okay.

325
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,337
You up for a little walk?

326
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,639
I'm assuming you're behind me.

327
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,062
"Men of science have made
abundant mistakes of every kind."

328
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,639
George Sarton said that.

329
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,567
You guys know who George Sarton is?
Doesn't really matter.

330
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,111
The point is,
mistakes have been made. Yes.

331
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,483
- Mistakes?
- Yes.

332
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,689
You killed Barbara.

333
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,618
Abundant mistakes, but,
the men involved with those mistakes,

334
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,617
the ones responsible for what happened
to your brother and Miss Holland's death,

335
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,415
they're gone.
They're gone, and for better for worse,

336
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,622
I'm the schmuck they brought in
to make things better.

337
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,835
But I can't make things better
without your help.

338
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,540
You mean without us shutting up?

339
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,923
She's tough, this one.
You guys been together long?

340
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,755
- We're not together.
- Wanna see what really killed your friend?

341
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,224
Teddy, I brought you an audience today.
I hope you don't mind.

342
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,520
More the merrier, sir.

343
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,443
I'd call it one hell of a mistake.

344
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,020
Wouldn't you?

345
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:45,491
See, the thing is,
we can't seem to erase our mistake...

346
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,994
but we can stop it from spreading.

347
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,076
Like, it's like pulling weeds.

348
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,296
But imagine for a moment
if a foreign state,

349
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,841
let's say, the Soviets...
If they heard about our mistake...

350
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,091
do you think they would even
consider that a mistake?

351
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,386
What if they tried to replicate that?

352
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,774
The more attention we bring to ourselves,
the more...

353
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,227
the more people like the Hollands
know the truth,

354
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,529
the more likely that scenario becomes.

355
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,284
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

356
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,326
Just, same as those weeds there.

357
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,740
By whatever means necessary.

358
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,000
So, we understand each other now,
don't we?

359
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,446
This is more of the same.

360
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,778
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.

361
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,623
Wait!

362
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,956
- What? What?
- Wait.

363
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,377
- Wait. These black lines, see?
- What?

364
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,163
Look, they connect.

365
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,134
They connect.

366
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,158
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

367
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,558
Does this mean anything to you?

368
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,648
No.

369
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,601
I mean,
is it some sort of maze or a road?

370
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:26,899
I mean, it's sort of forking
and branching like... like lightning.

371
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,153
You think it's that storm?

372
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,782
No, the storm he drew was
completely different. He used red.

373
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:35,991
And this is all blue
and it has some weird dirt color.

374
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,785
I mean, maybe it's roots.

375
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,417
'Cause remember,
he was saying it was spreading and...

376
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,872
Killing.

377
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,548
He said they were killing.

378
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,878
Vines.

379
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,268
He's drawing vines.

380
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:03,230
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin?
We're supposed to meet after class.

381
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,194
Max!

382
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,692
Hey, Max! Hey, where you going?
Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.

383
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,152
Yeah, good luck with that.

384
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,330
What is wrong with you?

385
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,248
What is wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

386
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,333
- I don't understand.
- No! I don't understand!

387
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,288
You guys act like
you want me to be your friend

388
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,840
but then you treat me like garbage!

389
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,633
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is!

390
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,005
You go and hide in the AV Club,

391
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,383
keeping secrets like we're
in second grade or something.

392
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,886
You know, I thought you guys wanted me
in your party.

393
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,388
- We do. But it's...
- But what?

394
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,562
There... there are just things.

395
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,061
Things we can't tell you, all right?
For your own safety.

396
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,857
- My own safety?
- Yes!

397
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,278
- Because I'm a girl?
- What? No!

398
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,151
Did you keep secrets from El?

399
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,150
How do you know about El?

400
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,576
Did you?

401
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,870
That was different. Trust me. Okay?

402
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,948
That was just... just different.

403
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,454
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay?

404
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,457
I don't wanna be in your
stupid party anyway. I'm out.

405
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,625
Have a nice life.

406
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,718
- Max!
- You still stink, by the way!

407
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,759
Oh, shit!

408
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,695
That kid you were talking to, who is he?

409
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,238
He's no one.

410
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,361
- No one?
- This kid from my class.

411
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,802
Why was he talking to you?

412
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,630
It was just about
a stupid class assignment.

413
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,467
- Then why're you so upset?
- I'm not!

414
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
He causing you trouble?

415
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,386
Why do you care?

416
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,267
Because, Max, you're a piece of shit,

417
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,769
but we're family now
whether we like it or not,

418
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,691
meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.

419
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,088
- What would I ever do without...
- Hey!

420
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,772
This is serious shit, okay?

421
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,402
I'm older than you.

422
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,779
And something you learn

423
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:19,158
is that there are a certain type of people
in this world that you stay away from,

424
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,864
and that kid, Max...

425
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,871
That kid is one of them.

426
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,753
You stay away from him, you hear me?

427
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,705
Stay away.

428
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,347
"Ives.

429
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,183
Terry."

430
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,911
Jane.

431
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,174
Papa.

432
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,460
<i>...President Reagan's...</i>

433
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,384

435

Three to the right.

Three to the right.
Four to the left.

438
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,257
Four-fifty...

439
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,350
Jane.

440
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,930
Mama?

441
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,453
Mama!

442
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,951
Mama?

443
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,050
Mama!

444
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,754
Mama!

445
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,559
Mama...

446
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,613
Mama!

447
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,961
Hello?

448
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,164
Will!

449
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,757
Mrs. Byers?

450
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,880
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

451
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,632
- Is Will here?
- You know what?

452
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,088
Now is not a really good time.

453
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,263
Is he okay?

454
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,310
Yeah. You know, he's...
he's just not feeling real well.

455
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,514
He's laying down,
so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?

456
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,856
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?

457
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,038
Have a nice day.

458
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,071
<i>Doesn't really matter.
The point is, mistakes have been made.</i>

459
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,322
<i>- Yes.
- Mistakes?</i>

460
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,132
<i>The men involved
with those mistakes,</i>

461
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,369
<i>the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother</i>

462
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,042
<i>and Miss Holland's death, they're gone...</i>

463
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,504
<i>...the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother</i>

464
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,049
<i>and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.</i>

465
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,045
You still wanna do this?

466
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,925
Let's burn that lab to the ground.

467
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,150
Mew-mew, dinner!

468
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,906
Where are you? Mew-mew!

469
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,328
- Hey, Dusty!
- Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.

470
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,907
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.

471
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,585
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy.

472
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,170
It's about my friend, Will.

473
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,050
I think...

474
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,768
What the hell?

475
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,074
Dart?

476
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,140
Oh, Jesus.

477
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:54,164
