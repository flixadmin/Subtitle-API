1
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,992
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

2
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,202
...you know.

3
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,372
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

4
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,417
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...

5
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,960
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,795
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,964
...people really like me.

8
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,883
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,386
That's okay.

10
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,556
The city is safe and sound.

11
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,683
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

12
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,185
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

13
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,110
I still get to school. Top of my class.

14
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,653
The Hamiltonian shows us...

15
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,032
...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,998
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?

17
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,167
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,628
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,840
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,222
Parker? You got something to add?

21
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,767
No, sir.

22
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,273
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

23
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,790
Hi.

24
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,753
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,339
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,883
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,308
I'm so nervous.

28
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,209
That's my girlfriend.

29
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,036
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,747
Harry?

31
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,332
Harry!

32
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,208
I need to talk to you.

33
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,878
Explain things.

34
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,508
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

35
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,056
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

36
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,232
M.J.!

37
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,693
- Peter!
- Congrats!

38
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,154
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

39
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,822
- You were--
- You said great.

40
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,369
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,456
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,751
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

43
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,962
Tell me again. Was I really good?

44
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,506
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,175
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

46
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,260
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

47
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,597
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

48
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,600
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an--

49
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,727
You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,532
Did you see that one?

51
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
You know what?

52
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,506
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

53
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,092
...with you in the first row.

54
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,262
I'll be there.

55
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,475
Tell me you love me.

56
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,604
I love you.

57
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,315
I love you so much.

58
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,109
I always have.

59
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,283
- Ready?
- Yep.

60
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,235
You can't hide here, Flint.

61
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,822
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

62
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,743
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

63
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,455
You're nothing but a common thief.

64
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:31,125
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

65
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,378
It wasn't.

66
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,005
I had good reason for what I was doing.

67
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,382
And that's the truth.

68
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,761
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

69
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,514
I live in the presence of great truth...

70
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,016
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

71
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,978
...right there in that bedroom.

72
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,701
Penny.

73
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,495
I missed you.

74
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,249
I miss you too, Daddy.

75
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,763
I promise, I'll make you healthy again.

76
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,891
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

77
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,103
You get out of here. Now.

78
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,782
I'm not a bad person.

79
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,370
Just had bad luck.

80
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,848
Peter, what is it?

81
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,809
It's M.J.

82
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,773
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

83
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:23,571
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

84
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,573
And excited.

85
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,533
And very young.

86
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,620
And I loved him so fiercely.

87
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,830
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

88
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,416
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

89
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,294
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

90
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,797
So we took our time.

91
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,341
Looked forward to it.

92
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:47,095
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

93
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,349
A man has to be understanding...

94
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,560
...and put his wife before himself.

95
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,897
Can you do that, Peter?

96
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,318
Yeah, I think I can.

97
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,780
Then you have my blessing.

98
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,993
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

99
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,497
Your uncle had it all planned.

100
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,624
He took me to the beach one Sunday.

101
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

102
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,255
And I didn't look too bad myself.

103
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,424
We were very good swimmers.

104
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,135
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

105
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,220
"Let's swim to the island."

106
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,431
And at the island...

107
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,809
...we found a perfect spot
by an old tree...

108
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,521
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

109
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,941
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

110
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,861
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

111
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,863
And I did.

112
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,866
And he was holding this ring.

113
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,702
Dazzling...

114
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,579
...in front of me.

115
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,375
I thought it was the sun.

116
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,630
We'd be married 50 years...

117
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,384
...come August if...

118
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,392
So...

119
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,399
...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

120
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,278
Do something she'll never forget.

121
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,866
Give her this.

122
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,245
Go on. Take it.

123
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,908
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

124
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,164
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

125
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,002
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself!

126
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,920
Shut up!

127
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,274
I'm still here, Peter.

128
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,384
Hate those things.

129
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,527
Harry?

130
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,949
Harry.

131
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,535
Harry.

132
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,500
Oh, my God.

133
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,425
Harry!

134
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,221
Come on!

135
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,558
God.

136
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,438
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

137
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,398
And clear.

138
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,775
No response.

139
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,735
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

140
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,196
- Charging.
- And clear.

141
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,489
No response.

142
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,867
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

143
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,250
Captain Stacy.

144
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,126
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

145
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,420
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

146
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,422
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

147
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,924
- And?
- He's on the run.

148
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,218
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

149
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,432
There he is!

150
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,787
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

151
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,835
Where'd he go?

152
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,525
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

153
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,819
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on one.

154
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,698
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

155
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,617
Initiating demolecularization.

156
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,667
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

157
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,253
But there's been
some memory impairment.

158
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,088
Particularly his short-term memory.

159
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,298
Right now he can't remember
the accident...

160
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,592
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

161
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,011
Is it permanent?

162
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,222
It could be. Only time will tell.

163
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,808
He's awake if you wanna see him.

164
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,268
Maybe I should wait.

165
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,147
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

166
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,167
Hey, buddy.

167
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,294
Hey.

168
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,504
Hit my head.

169
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,298
Yeah.

170
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,800
Doctor said I was in an accident.

171
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,010
Hit-and-run.

172
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,305
I don't remember much of anything.

173
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,475
My father...

174
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,518
...he died, right?

175
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,315
This is all so weird.

176
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,901
Hi.

177
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,196
- I got here as fast as I could.
- I know that face.

178
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,616
- How you doing?
- I don't know.

179
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,826
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

180
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,119
Somewhere.

181
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,121
You're still fine.

182
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,500
We love you, Harry.

183
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,169
It feels like...

184
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,465
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

185
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,718
And now I'm back home.

186
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,596
It's good to have you back.

187
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,683
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

188
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,186
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

189
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,313
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,482
Yeah. Great.

191
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,818
Get some sleep.

192
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,824
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

193
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,618
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

194
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,414
You have lovely friends.

195
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,667
My best friends.

196
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,463
I'd give my life for them.

197
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,280
- Yeah?
- It's me.

198
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,699
Hey.

199
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,243
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

200
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,078
It's stuck again?

201
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,414
Just come on and help me.

202
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,124
I'm coming.

203
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,549
- Hey.
- The review.

204
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,428
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

205
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,847
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl...

206
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,141
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

207
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,602
Her small voice didn't
carry past the first row."

208
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,854
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

209
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,606
You were in the first row.

210
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,109
Yeah, this-- Listen, you were great.

211
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,697
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

212
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,368
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

213
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,538
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

214
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,542
I know, and I'm just saying,
you can't let it bring you down.

215
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,128
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

216
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,963
You get right back
on the horse and--

217
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,965
Don't give me the horse thing.

218
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,551
Try and understand how I feel.

219
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,183
It's just...

220
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
... look at these words...

221
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,566
...and it's like my father wrote them.

222
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,863
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th
and Sixth Avenue, please report.

223
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,699
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

224
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,913
"Go get them, tiger"?

225
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,542
I'm sorry.

226
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,035
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

227
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,038
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

228
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,542
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

229
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,302
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

230
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,058
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

231
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,023
What is that thing doing
in my background?

232
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,510
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

233
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,471
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

234
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,267
Are you all right?

235
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,019
It's coming back.

236
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,147
Oh, no.

237
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,882
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

238
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,472
What's she doing up there?

239
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,433
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

240
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,562
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

241
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,647
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

242
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,567
And I'm dating your daughter.

243
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,123
You okay?

244
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,834
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,085
Thank you.

246
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,630
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

247
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,632
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy!

248
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,968
- Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?

249
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,386
Sweetie.

250
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,679
You okay?

251
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,724
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

252
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,727
So smile.
Are you smiling? Just kidding.

253
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,229
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

254
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:53,026
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

255
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,904
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

256
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,739
Just-- Yeah, a little chunky.

257
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,367
Okay.

258
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,120
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore, buddy.

259
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,421
Dazzle me.

260
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,932
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

261
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,018
As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.

262
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,104
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

263
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,981
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller--

264
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,150
Get on with it, you moron--!

265
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,319
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

266
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,656
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife--

267
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,036
Thank you.

268
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,958
So I propose this campaign.

269
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,585
"Daily Bugle." That's obvious.

270
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,880
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

271
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,509
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

272
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,011
We gave him a couple lattes, he's like:

273
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,140
"And how." That's me again.

274
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,392
Time to take your pill.

275
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,311
Not that one.

276
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,772
Not that one.

277
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,324
Drink plenty of water.

278
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
Thank you.

279
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,000
Continue.

280
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,214
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

281
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,924
What's that smell?

282
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,386
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

283
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,180
It's called Go Away.

284
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,307
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

285
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,351
- ...and you have had some doozies!
- Blood pressure.

286
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,520
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,775
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

288
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,819
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

289
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,323
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

290
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,366
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

291
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,659
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

292
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,578
You better get in there. New guy.

293
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,581
He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

294
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,667
Thanks.

295
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,796
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

296
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,547
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

297
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,050
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

298
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,594
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

299
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,597
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

300
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,517
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

301
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,060
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

302
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,938
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

303
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,523
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

304
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,400
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

305
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,279
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

306
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,657
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

307
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,992
I want a staff job, sir.

308
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,329
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

309
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,415
...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

310
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,044
...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

311
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,963
J. Jonah Jameson.

312
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,219
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

313
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,554
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

314
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,682
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

315
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,934
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

316
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,855
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

317
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,982
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

318
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,984
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

319
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,944
Shut up. Get out.

320
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,573
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

321
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,577
He's a fake, he's full of stick um.
Catch him in the act.

322
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,413
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

323
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,540
Whoever brings me that photo gets a job.

324
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,625
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

325
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm on it, boss.

326
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,464
- You'll never get that shot.
- Oh, we'll see.

327
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:02,984
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

328
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,195
Enough said.

329
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,995
Welcome home, Harry.

330
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,166
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

331
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,501
- Bernard.
- Sir.

332
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,006
Got you a little homecoming present.

333
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,800
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

334
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,052
Thanks, buddy.

335
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,096
We were pretty good in the backyard,
weren't we?

336
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,934
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

337
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,144
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

338
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,855
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

339
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,190
You don't?

340
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,360
Hey, Bernard. Do I have any girlfriends?

341
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,029
Not that I know of, sir.

342
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,203
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

343
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,038
It's okay.

344
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,166
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

345
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:04,128
Well, maybe I can turn
this no-girlfriend thing around.

346
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:16,766
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

347
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,894
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

348
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,899
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

349
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:30,405
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

350
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,698
Okay.

351
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,492
Heads up.

352
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,871
Did you see that?

353
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,874
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

354
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,659
Why are we stopping?

355
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,831
What is she doing here?

356
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,916
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

357
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,213
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

358
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,923
I'm sorry.

359
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,551
- One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.

360
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,971
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

361
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,724
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

362
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,737
That was so poorly handled.

363
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,405
Yeah.

364
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,741
Let's just rehearse.

365
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,791
All right, Spidey!

366
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,937
Go, Spidey!

367
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,648
All right!

368
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,072
Yeah, Spidey!

369
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,081
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

370
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,835
Excuse me, miss? Could I please see
that gorgeous smile?

371
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,670
Hi, Eddie.

372
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:54,090
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

373
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,842
I gotta practice. See you later.

374
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,885
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

375
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,512
Why not?

376
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,558
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

377
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,812
We had a coffee, Eddie.

378
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,689
Hey, beautiful!

379
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,816
One more.

380
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,446
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,784
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

382
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,036
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

383
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,831
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

384
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,208
Give them a good show.

385
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,460
Don't worry about that review.

386
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,131
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

387
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,841
Yeah.

388
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,235
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

389
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,862
He fits.

390
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,489
Hey, you. Halt!

391
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,992
Cover the back.

392
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,290
- Hon, be careful.
- Come on, let's go.

393
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,256
He's in the truck!

394
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,299
Around the front!

395
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,939
Fire!

396
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,673
People of the city of New York...

397
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,343
...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

398
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,137
...and someone caught me.

399
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,307
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

400
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:53,144
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

401
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,395
Hey, M.J.

402
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,939
- Harry!
- Hey.

403
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,482
Where's Pete?

404
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,402
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

405
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,363
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

406
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,865
I've never felt better.

407
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,159
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

408
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,120
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

409
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,581
Will you bump me on the head?

410
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,044
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

411
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,880
You came. You sent me flowers.

412
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,507
I did? I'll come again tonight.

413
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,261
You can't. I was let go.

414
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,138
What happened?

415
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,224
I wasn't very good.

416
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,770
You know, this is embarrassing...

417
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,230
...but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

418
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,066
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

419
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,817
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

420
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,196
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

421
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,783
...or your store's being robbed,
or your house is on fire...

422
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,035
...who is it that breaks your fall...

423
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,872
...puts out the flames
and saves your children?

424
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,707
Spider-Man!

425
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,958
They love me.

426
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,462
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

427
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:06,133
...friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!

428
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,357
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

429
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,944
Shazam!

430
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:27,988
Hey, guys.

431
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,782
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

432
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,118
Hey there. Hi.

433
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,246
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

434
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,124
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

435
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,751
Go ahead, lay one on me.

436
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,711
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

437
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,380
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

438
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,840
No, Spider-Man, no.

439
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,883
All right.

440
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,353
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

441
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,735
Hey, hey, are you okay?

442
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,446
Yeah, I'm fine.

443
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,243
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

444
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,059
Jig's up, pal.

445
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,729
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

446
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,149
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

447
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,359
Okay.

448
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,524
Help!

449
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,519
Where do all these guys come from?

450
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,824
I'm sorry, I don't speak--

451
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,869
But this is a French restaurant, non?

452
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,917
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

453
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,047
Here we are.

454
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,383
Table for two. Parker.

455
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,678
- Parker.
- That is what I said:

456
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,638
Parker.

457
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,017
I have a request.

458
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:11,605
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

459
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,320
Hello.

460
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:21,532
Oh, so you want to pop
the question tonight, huh?

461
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,535
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

462
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,162
I love it. Romance.

463
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,872
I am French.

464
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,461
When I signal you, if you'd bring
some champagne with the ring--

465
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,922
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

466
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,175
Also, I thought at the same time...

467
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,887
...If the musicians would play this song...

468
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,015
Their favorite.

469
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,893
And take good care of the ring.

470
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,604
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

471
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,317
I like you.

472
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,947
Thank you.

473
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,377
Okay, so...

474
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,255
Oh, would you like some champagne?

475
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,011
How'd that get in there?

476
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,473
Oh, don't cry.

477
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,021
Hi.

478
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,899
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

479
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,650
Thanks.

480
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,448
This place in your budget?

481
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,784
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

482
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,036
You're on Broadway.

483
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,414
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.

484
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,876
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

485
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,628
Peter...

486
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,173
...you have no idea
how I feel right now.

487
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,343
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

488
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,970
Listen, I have been through this.

489
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,264
It happens to me all the time.

490
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,391
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

491
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,894
...kids running around
with me on their sweaters--

492
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,729
Big Halloween item.

493
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,732
I don't know, I guess
I've become something of an icon.

494
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,570
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

495
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,825
I don't know, you know,
I mean, I'm thinking to myself:

496
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,912
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

497
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,290
Hi, Pete.

498
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,750
Hi.

499
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,553
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

500
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,472
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

501
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,016
This is Mary Jane Watson.

502
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,355
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

503
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,444
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

504
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,781
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

505
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,867
Which actually reminds me...

506
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,203
...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

507
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,622
...could you bring it to class?

508
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,668
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

509
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:23,046
After all, who gets kissed
by Spider-Man, right?

510
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,549
I can't imagine.

511
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,428
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

512
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,889
- Good night.
- Good night.

513
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,110
Oh, she's in my science class.

514
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,154
It's not her best subject.

515
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,741
What?

516
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,160
How come you never mentioned her?

517
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,663
She's your lab partner?

518
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,124
You saved her life?

519
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,792
She thinks you're a genius...

520
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,254
...and she had her polished fingernails
all over you?

521
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,964
Or didn't you notice?

522
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,719
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

523
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,972
I'll never forget that.

524
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,102
She's just a girl in my class.

525
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,063
Let me ask you something.

526
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,190
When you kissed her...

527
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,776
...who was kissing her?

528
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,654
Spider-Man or Peter?

529
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,740
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

530
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,076
That was our Kiss.

531
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,911
Why would you do that?

532
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,957
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

533
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:44,002
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

534
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,713
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

535
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,842
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

536
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,471
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

537
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,722
No, w--

538
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,227
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

539
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,065
Here we are.

540
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,604
Hi, it's M.J.
Sing your song at the beep.

541
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,441
Hello.

542
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,864
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on, or...

543
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,034
I don't know
if you got the messages or what.

544
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,702
But...

545
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,164
...I just wanna talk to you.

546
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,251
Okay, call me. Bye.

547
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,181
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

548
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,474
Yeah?

549
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,143
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

550
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,103
I'm calling
on behalf of Captain Stacy.

551
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,689
He would like you
to come down to the station.

552
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:31,318
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

553
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,361
...was your husband's killer.

554
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,405
We were wrong.

555
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:36,990
What?

556
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,993
Turns out
Mr. Carradine was only an accomplice.

557
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,579
The actual killer is still at large.

558
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,456
What are you talking about?

559
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,375
This is the man
who killed your husband.

560
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,173
His name is Flint Marko.

561
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,343
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

562
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,969
You got this wrong.

563
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,346
Two days ago he escaped.

564
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,849
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

565
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,853
...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

566
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,535
No, wait, son. You don't wanna do this.

567
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,164
No!

568
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,801
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

569
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,530
Would you put these photos away,
please?

570
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,949
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

571
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,577
...but, please, be patient with us.

572
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,579
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

573
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,414
No, you're not doing your job.

574
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,375
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

575
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,587
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

576
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,922
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

577
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,841
I have no intention of settling down.

578
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,594
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

579
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,146
L-20 Parkway.

580
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,940
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

581
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,567
We have an abandoned vehicle...

582
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,986
...and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

583
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,488
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

584
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,743
Peter, it's M.J.

585
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,246
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

586
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,623
Just please open up.

587
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,633
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

588
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,426
She's worried about you.

589
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,678
I'm worried about you.

590
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,305
Don't be. I'm fine.

591
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,849
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

592
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,477
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

593
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,979
And do something you'll regret.

594
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,149
Like with that other guy.

595
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,028
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

596
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,448
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- Ten-22, auto at 556...

597
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:27,535
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

598
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:32,540
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9 responding
to your Sixth Avenue call.

599
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,127
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

600
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,839
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

601
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,551
...but I wanna be here for you.

602
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,846
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

603
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,557
But I'm fine. I--

604
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,601
I don't need your help.

605
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,903
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.

606
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,905
Even Spider-Man.

607
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,708
Ninety X-ray, 98.

608
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:21,172
Two-four King, respond to 1031
at 642 Madison Ave.

609
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:26,386
One-three Thomas, respond to 1020
at 540 East 107.

610
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:30,390
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

611
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,231
Three Henry 10-11,
I have a residence. 73815...

612
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,292
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

613
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,420
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

614
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,880
Did you?

615
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,769
Where am I?

616
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,662
What is this?

617
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,499
I feel...

618
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,339
This feels good.

619
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,103
Yeah!

620
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,954
This is something else.

621
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,374
What do you think?

622
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,626
I've never seen anything like it.

623
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,628
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

624
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,506
...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

625
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,841
Can we do that now?

626
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,015
It seems to like you.

627
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,103
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

628
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,856
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

629
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,151
...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

630
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,905
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

631
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,449
...they can be hard to unbind.

632
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,579
Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

633
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,290
Another sandstorm
is reported in the vicinity.

634
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,668
- All cars proceed with caution.
- Marko.

635
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,976
Buddy, love the new outfit.

636
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,144
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

637
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,063
Give me some of that web
action.

638
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,984
See you, chump.

639
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,320
What the hell?!

640
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,739
Flint Marko.

641
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,578
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

642
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,415
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

643
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,627
What does it matter to you anyway?

644
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,755
Everything!

645
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,795
It's time to pay, Marko!

646
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,742
Good riddance.

647
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,432
- Rent.
- Not now.

648
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,310
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

649
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,687
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

650
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,815
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

651
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,912
That wasn't cool.

652
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,374
He is a good boy.

653
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,961
He must be in some kind of trouble.

654
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,388
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

655
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,808
...he was killed last night.

656
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,434
Oh, my.

657
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,228
What happened?

658
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,313
Spider-Man killed him.

659
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,441
Spider-Man?

660
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,236
I don't understand.

661
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:48,239
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

662
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,701
What happened?

663
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,997
I...

664
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,332
He--

665
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,668
He was...

666
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,717
I thought that you'd feel...

667
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,221
He deserved it, didn't he?

668
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,640
I don't think it's for us to say...

669
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,811
...whether a person deserves
to live or die.

670
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:22,023
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

671
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,692
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

672
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:28,362
But he wouldn't want us
living one second...

673
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,240
...with revenge in our hearts.

674
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,120
It's like a poison. It can--

675
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,040
It can take you over.

676
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,044
Before you know it...

677
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,922
...turn us into something ugly.

678
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,605
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

679
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,734
Hello?

680
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,444
Hey, Harry, it's M.J.

681
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,696
Hi.

682
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,280
I need some company.

683
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,741
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

684
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,119
Yeah, sure, come on over.

685
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,621
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

686
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,374
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

687
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,085
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

688
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,795
Bye.

689
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,965
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

690
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,384
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

691
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,761
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

692
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:19,306
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

693
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,100
Right away, sir.

694
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,870
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

695
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:44,290
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

696
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,377
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

697
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,464
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

698
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,966
It's no big deal.

699
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:58,220
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

700
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,680
Today's good.

701
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,682
Okay.

702
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,518
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just--

703
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,729
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

704
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,524
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

705
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,153
"You're a good woman.
I am good man.”

706
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,035
-Hi, Pete.

707
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,495
He's calling a woman.

708
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,580
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good--

709
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,626
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

710
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,922
- You should call.
- Thanks.

711
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:37,718
- Bye.
- Bye.

712
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,691
Hi.

713
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,280
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

714
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,950
Come on.

715
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,373
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

716
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,190
No. Please.

717
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,370
Oh, the butter.

718
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,174
Beautiful.

719
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,346
Check this out.

720
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,814
Well, we can use that part.

721
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,610
You've been dreaming.

722
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,155
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

723
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:24,158
- All right.
- When did you write that?

724
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,869
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

725
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,706
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

726
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,458
It's yours.

727
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:38,088
You know, there's not even a scar.

728
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,258
Barely.

729
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,361
- Sorry.
- Me too.

730
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:04,615
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

731
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:06,992
Mary Jane.

732
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,287
Mary Jane.

733
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,749
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

734
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,668
Just--

735
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,183
You've taken your eye off the ball.

736
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,732
Harry.

737
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,122
What have you done?!

738
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,334
Avenge me!

739
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:04,633
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

740
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,011
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

741
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:10,014
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

742
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,475
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

743
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,769
Harry.

744
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,648
Remember me?

745
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,486
Yes, Father. I remember.

746
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,865
I was right about her. About Peter.

747
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,284
About everything.

748
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,414
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

749
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,916
Make him wish he were dead.

750
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,046
First, we attack his heart!

751
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,309
Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

752
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,145
Hey, M.J. It's Peter.

753
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,275
I wanna talk to you about last night.

754
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,028
I don't know what I was thinking.

755
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:11,116
I know you were just there
to help and I...

756
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,119
I don't know. I wanna see you.

757
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,544
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

758
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,300
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

759
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,052
Come in.

760
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,646
-Hi, Pete.

761
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,981
There's a phone call for you.

762
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,110
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

763
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

764
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:55,077
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

765
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,123
-Hey.

766
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,959
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to--

767
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,920
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

768
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,506
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

769
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,508
At the bridge in the park.

770
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,009
- On my way.
- Okay.

771
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,179
Okay. Hey. I love you.

772
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,534
You look beautiful.

773
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,412
Peonies.

774
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,542
- You okay?
- No.

775
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,545
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

776
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,505
Okay.

777
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,425
It's not working.

778
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,094
You and me.

779
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,597
What?

780
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,308
I don't wanna see you anymore.

781
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,727
What are you talking about?

782
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,937
I don't know.

783
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,442
I'm lonely.

784
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,904
You aren't there for me.

785
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,491
I can't do this.

786
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,659
- It's over.
- No.

787
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,954
Please. Please don't say that.

788
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,750
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

789
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:28,504
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

790
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,881
We have problems.
When people have problems...

791
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,759
...they work it out.
They talk to each other.

792
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,599
Look, you see?

793
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,852
You know what this is?

794
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:48,148
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else!

795
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,109
I've fallen in love with someone else.

796
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,424
Bravo.

797
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,814
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

798
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,568
There's another guy.

799
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,322
Well, how you holding up?

800
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,783
Not good.

801
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,746
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

802
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:46,915
Really?

803
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:53,130
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

804
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:56,133
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

805
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,136
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

806
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,556
Singing waitress? What are you--?
What are you talking about?

807
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:05,267
Well, she was fired from the show.

808
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,269
Didn't she tell you?

809
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,021
She was fired?

810
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,567
She was fired and she told you?

811
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,861
She didn't tell me?

812
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,948
Well, that's why I asked you here, Pete.

813
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,160
I'm the other guy.

814
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:26,788
What?

815
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,958
Look, she came to me one afternoon,
troubled.

816
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,045
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

817
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,007
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

818
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,967
It just...

819
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,136
...started.

820
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:51,855
I don't believe this.
I don't-- I don't believe you.

821
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,358
Look, I'm really sorry.

822
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,236
I just thought you should know.

823
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,665
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

824
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,210
How's the pie?

825
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,629
So good.

826
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,819
Would you like a drink?

827
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,199
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

828
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:28,785
Bad for the public image,
right, Mr. Key-to-the-City?

829
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,287
What did you do to her?

830
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:35,167
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

831
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,295
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

832
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:43,467
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

833
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:47,804
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

834
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,931
That taste...

835
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:52,809
Strawberries.

836
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,013
How'd you like that, Spidey?

837
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,185
That all you got?

838
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,070
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

839
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,405
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

840
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:36,621
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

841
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,915
I'm done trying to convince you.

842
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,585
You took him from me.

843
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,169
He loved me.

844
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,713
No.

845
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,299
He despised you.

846
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,676
You were an embarrassment to him.

847
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:57,267
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

848
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,473
Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.

849
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,558
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.

850
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:42,395
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

851
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:45,774
- Who's she to look up to now?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

852
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,986
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

853
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:55,158
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

854
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:56,910
This is so wonderful for you.

855
01:30:57,077 --> 01:31:00,872
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
to make a little more wall space.

856
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:09,381
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

857
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,967
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

858
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,552
There's your hero.

859
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:19,641
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

860
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,435
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

861
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:23,979
Funny you should say that...

862
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:28,316
...because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

863
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,402
...Similar.

864
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:34,406
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

865
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,618
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

866
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,745
Your picture's a fake.

867
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:45,750
Parker, you are such a boy scout.

868
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,003
When are you gonna give
a guy a break?

869
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,298
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

870
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:56,052
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

871
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:02,767
Yeah. No, we--
We're just horsing around.

872
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:07,147
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

873
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,566
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

874
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,068
You should've thought of that earlier.

875
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,030
What are you doing, Peter?

876
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:19,409
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

877
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,167
It's a fake.

878
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:31,296
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

879
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,885
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

880
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,512
- I was just trying--
- You're fired!

881
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,475
We're gonna have to print
a retraction now.

882
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,602
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years!

883
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:54,486
- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

884
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,112
Oh, Dr. Connors.

885
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,823
How are you?

886
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:02,202
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.

887
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:07,123
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

888
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,500
Thanks.

889
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:11,127
- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

890
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:15,924
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

891
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:20,261
It amplifies characteristics of its host.

892
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:24,099
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

893
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,060
This could be dangerous.

894
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:30,730
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

895
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:34,609
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

896
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,486
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

897
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:39,197
No, no, no. Course not.

898
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,296
These shots are so good.

899
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:58,007
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

900
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:01,970
Peter Parker. Peter.

901
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:06,432
Parker! Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

902
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,226
Black-suit Spider-Man.

903
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,813
Peter, these are incredible.

904
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,858
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

905
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,487
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

906
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,447
...double the money.

907
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,992
Penny.

908
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,751
You are really gonna dig this joint.

909
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,796
Do you think I'm--?
I'm dressed all right?

910
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:01,839
Too fancy or too...

911
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,385
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

912
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:09,639
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

913
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,602
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

914
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:21,317
Oh, this is so cool.

915
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:24,195
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

916
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:30,410
I hope we can get a table.

917
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,583
Find us some shade.

918
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,795
Thanks, hot legs.

919
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,548
Right this way, sir.

920
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:53,224
Oh, why, thank you.

921
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:02,191
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

922
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:11,451
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

923
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:15,955
- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll-- I'll be okay.

924
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:19,000
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

925
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:27,633
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

926
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:37,977
Peter?

927
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,107
This is for you.

928
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,281
Double-time.

929
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:57,121
Thanks.

930
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,733
Now dig on this.

931
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,194
That is hot!

932
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,032
Yeah, sexy!

933
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,070
That was all for her?

934
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,289
I'm so sorry.

935
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,095
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

936
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:37,805
Okay.

937
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,226
Hey.

938
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,688
What's wrong with you?

939
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:48,441
You.

940
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:51,944
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

941
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,197
Is everything okay here, Paul?

942
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,616
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

943
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:59,160
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

944
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:02,163
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

945
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:05,708
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

946
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,087
Peter, stop it!

947
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,850
Who are you?

948
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,979
I don't know.

949
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,574
It's Brock, sir.

950
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:04,160
Edward Brock Jr.

951
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,497
I come before you today...

952
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,667
...humbled...

953
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,671
...and humiliated...

954
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,676
...to ask you for one thing.

955
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,142
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

956
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:20,194
Parker.

957
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,509
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

958
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:13,390
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

959
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:18,103
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

960
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,612
When we spoke on the phone...

961
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,240
...I sensed that something
was bothering you...

962
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:33,369
...so I thought I'd just come by.

963
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:38,123
How's Mary Jane?

964
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,292
I don't know.

965
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:45,130
I never heard from you.

966
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:47,800
Did you ever propose?

967
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,472
You said...

968
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:57,893
...a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

969
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,150
I'm not ready.

970
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:09,530
But what happened?

971
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,867
You seemed so sure.

972
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,744
Yeah.

973
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:18,622
I...

974
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,385
I hurt her, Aunt May.

975
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:34,805
I don't know what to do.

976
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:40,477
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

977
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:44,189
You forgive yourself.

978
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,862
I believe in you, Peter.

979
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,740
You're a good person.

980
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:58,746
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

981
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,380
In time.

982
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,817
End of the line, Spider-Man.

983
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:35,157
I want him dead too, Flint.

984
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:38,077
That's why I've been looking for you.

985
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:41,497
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

986
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:45,918
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

987
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:49,380
It's just--
That doesn't seem right to me.

988
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:54,468
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

989
01:47:54,635 --> 01:47:57,888
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

990
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:00,975
Interested?

991
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:03,894
Yeah.

992
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:06,832
So...

993
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:09,626
...where to?

994
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:10,834
All New York is holding its breath...

995
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:12,504
All New York is holding its breath...

996
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:15,340
...as the hostage crisis continues
to unfold.

997
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:18,343
Just 30 minutes ago...

998
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,596
...police came across this startling sight:

999
01:49:20,763 --> 01:49:22,890
A young woman, held hostage in a taxi...

1000
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:25,350
...suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

1001
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:28,395
...In what appears to be a giant web.

1002
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:31,231
Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...

1003
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,233
...has been thwarted
by the Sandman.

1004
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:37,863
Compounding the danger...

1005
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,949
...is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.

1006
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:44,787
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

1007
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:48,499
...but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

1008
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:53,712
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

1009
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:57,966
...an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

1010
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:26,078
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

1011
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:27,996
...with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

1012
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:30,624
We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and--

1013
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:34,586
Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.

1014
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:38,340
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1015
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:44,138
Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.

1016
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,973
And that raises serious questions...

1017
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:49,893
...about what kind of chance
he'd stand against such overwhelming--

1018
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,238
Harry?

1019
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:06,743
I need your help.

1020
01:51:07,202 --> 01:51:10,581
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1021
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:19,840
You don't deserve my help.

1022
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:24,261
Harry...

1023
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,972
...she needs us.

1024
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,145
Get out.

1025
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:51,997
If I may, sir?

1026
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:58,170
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

1027
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:00,380
What are you trying to tell me?

1028
01:52:01,215 --> 01:52:03,967
The night your father died...

1029
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:06,553
...I cleaned his wound.

1030
01:52:08,096 --> 01:52:11,725
The blade that pierced his body...

1031
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,561
...came from his glider.

1032
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:20,234
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

1033
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,569
...but there's no question...

1034
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:25,781
...that he died by his own hand.

1035
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:31,286
I loved your father...

1036
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:35,540
...as I have loved you, Harry.

1037
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:39,044
As your friends love you.

1038
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:27,301
Look.

1039
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:51,742
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

1040
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:59,249
He seems to have come out of nowhere...

1041
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:01,418
...to answer the prayers of the city...

1042
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:03,587
...just when all hope seemed to be lost.

1043
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:12,471
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1044
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:16,058
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1045
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:27,027
Hey, Parker.

1046
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:28,403
My God. Eddie.

1047
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,781
My spider-sense is tingling...

1048
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:35,202
...if you know what I'm talking about.

1049
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:56,223
We can find a way to settle this.

1050
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,808
You're so right.

1051
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:01,353
I'm thinking humiliation.

1052
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:04,481
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

1053
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:07,109
Do you remember?

1054
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:11,738
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1055
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:30,841
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1056
01:55:32,717 --> 01:55:34,636
How's that sound, tiger?

1057
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:36,198
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1058
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,688
Mary Jane!

1059
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:12,961
It's hard to believe what's happening.

1060
01:58:13,128 --> 01:58:15,463
The brutality of it.

1061
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:18,008
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1062
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:21,720
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1063
01:58:21,886 --> 01:58:23,888
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1064
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:52,500
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1065
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:18,985
You came.

1066
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:29,037
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1067
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:31,706
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1068
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:33,458
What are you gonna do?

1069
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:38,880
I may need some help over here.

1070
01:59:39,047 --> 01:59:41,466
I'm a little busy right now.

1071
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:44,469
Give me your hand!

1072
01:59:58,817 --> 02:00:01,695
Parker! Parker, where--?

1073
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,446
I need a photographer.

1074
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:04,906
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1075
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:08,410
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1076
02:00:08,576 --> 02:00:11,496
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1077
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:13,081
A hundred bucks?

1078
02:00:14,999 --> 02:00:18,628
All right, you little crook. Here.

1079
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:21,798
What the--?

1080
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,385
Film's extra.

1081
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:33,059
Gotcha.

1082
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:42,360
Pete, up top!

1083
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:04,215
Mary Jane.

1084
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:08,219
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1085
02:01:08,386 --> 02:01:09,512
To what?

1086
02:01:13,975 --> 02:01:15,769
- Go, buddy!
- Got her!

1087
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,156
You okay?

1088
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:31,826
Yeah.

1089
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:35,788
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1090
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:36,956
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1091
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,044
Am I interrupting?

1092
02:02:57,328 --> 02:02:59,163
Never wound...

1093
02:02:59,998 --> 02:03:02,041
...what you can't kill.

1094
02:03:05,837 --> 02:03:09,382
Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off.

1095
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,217
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1096
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:15,889
I know what it feels like.

1097
02:03:16,514 --> 02:03:18,141
It feels good.

1098
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:20,852
The power. Everything.

1099
02:03:21,019 --> 02:03:23,479
But you'll lose yourself.

1100
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:25,982
Let it go.

1101
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:28,192
I like being bad.

1102
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:31,070
It makes me happy.

1103
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:21,663
Harry!

1104
02:05:34,736 --> 02:05:36,446
Peter. What are you doing?!

1105
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:39,824
No!

1106
02:05:41,617 --> 02:05:43,202
Eddie!

1107
02:06:02,096 --> 02:06:04,098
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1108
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:06,225
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1109
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:08,436
Stay.

1110
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:19,155
I didn't want this.

1111
02:06:23,618 --> 02:06:25,828
But I had no choice.

1112
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:31,667
We always have a choice.

1113
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:34,045
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1114
02:06:36,547 --> 02:06:38,549
My daughter was dying.

1115
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:42,595
I needed money.

1116
02:06:47,391 --> 02:06:49,352
I was scared.

1117
02:06:56,859 --> 02:06:59,946
I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.

1118
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:02,031
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1119
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:04,575
He said to me:

1120
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:07,995
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

1121
02:07:12,083 --> 02:07:15,086
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1122
02:07:21,884 --> 02:07:24,804
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1123
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:27,265
And the gun was in my hand.

1124
02:07:37,775 --> 02:07:39,193
Get in!

1125
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:43,447
I did a terrible thing to you...

1126
02:07:44,824 --> 02:07:48,244
...and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1127
02:07:53,499 --> 02:07:56,085
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1128
02:07:57,003 --> 02:07:59,338
I just want you to understand.

1129
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:11,767
I've done terrible things too.

1130
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:30,786
I didn't choose to be this.

1131
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:42,048
The only thing left of me now...

1132
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:46,135
...is my daughter.

1133
02:08:58,356 --> 02:09:00,316
I forgive you.

1134
02:09:43,567 --> 02:09:46,612
Hey, pal. How you doing?

1135
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,406
Been better.

1136
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:51,867
We'll get you through this.

1137
02:09:55,621 --> 02:09:57,123
No.

1138
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:07,425
I should never have hurt you...

1139
02:10:08,843 --> 02:10:11,137
...said those things.

1140
02:10:12,805 --> 02:10:15,349
None of that matters, Peter.

1141
02:10:17,184 --> 02:10:19,186
You're my friend.

1142
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:25,735
Best friend.

1143
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:46,297
Harry.

1144
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:34,470
Whatever comes our way...

1145
02:11:35,137 --> 02:11:37,306
...whatever battle
we have raging inside us...

1146
02:11:37,473 --> 02:11:39,767
...we always have a choice.

1147
02:11:41,769 --> 02:11:43,938
My friend Harry taught me that.

1148
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:47,358
He chose to be the best of himself.

1149
02:11:48,192 --> 02:11:51,195
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1150
02:11:51,362 --> 02:11:54,782
...and we can always choose
to do what's right.
