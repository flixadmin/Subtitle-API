1
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,296
How many of those fingers do you think
we could shove up his ass?

2
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,423
Depends if he's had any practice.

3
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,927
Is that the sort of thing you
and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

4
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,263
She loosened you up for us?

5
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,522
He's going to fall.

6
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,942
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

7
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,369
Water.

8
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,374
Water. Please, water.

9
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,296
Wa-- water. Water, please.

10
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,672
Please. Please.

11
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:05,059
-If I die, you won't be getting…
-Oh, enough. Here.

12
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,528
Can't say that I've ever seen
a man drink horse piss that fast.

13
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,348
Stop!

14
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,399
Far enough.

15
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,308
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

16
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,272
Come on, you.

17
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,994
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

18
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,912
I hope we might speak.

19
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,707
In confidence.

20
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,543
Always in confidence.

21
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,795
About the events of the Blackwater.

22
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,842
-Perhaps this is the wrong time?
-No. It's a wonderful time.

23
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,429
I thought one of your little birds
might have knowledge

24
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,056
-of my sister's intentions to--
-End your life?

25
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:12,353
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies
along with his position, I'm afraid.

26
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,063
Which is why I'm coming to you.

27
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,107
-I need proof.
-Proof?

28
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,901
-Will there be a trial?
-I need to know.

29
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,072
I have no proof, only whispers.

30
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,787
Before all this nastiness,

31
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,915
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

32
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,878
-Do you want to hear it still?
-I don't know. Do I?

33
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,339
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

34
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,632
through the Free Cities.

35
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,888
One day in Myr, a certain man
made my master an offer

36
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,975
too tempting to refuse.
I feared the man meant to use me

37
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,728
as I'd heard
some men used small boys.

38
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,897
But what he wanted was far worse.

39
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,277
He gave me a potion that made me
powerless to move or speak,

40
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,529
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

41
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:09,410
With a hooked blade, he sliced me,
root and stem, chanting all the while.

42
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,705
He burned my parts in a brazier.

43
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,127
The flames turned blue
and I heard a voice answer his call.

44
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,718
I still dream of that night.

45
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,723
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade,

46
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:37,897
I dream of the voice from the flames.
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

47
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,649
I don't know.

48
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,986
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

49
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,905
And ever since that day,

50
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,326
I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

51
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,620
But you can see why I was eager to aid

52
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,040
in your fight against Stannis
and his Red Priestess.

53
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,168
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

54
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,422
Yes. I feel the need for actual revenge

55
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,927
against the actual person
who tried to have me killed.

56
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,764
Which will require
a degree of influence, which--

57
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,434
You do not possess at the moment.

58
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:22,108
But influence is largely a matter
of patience, I have found.

59
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,862
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

60
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,739
he threw me out of his house to die.

61
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:34,287
I resolved to live to spite him. I begged.

62
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,665
I sold what parts of my body
remained to me.

63
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,292
I became an excellent thief

64
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,754
and soon learned
that the contents of a man's letters

65
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
are more valuable
than the contents of his purse.

66
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:52,680
Step by step,
one distasteful task after another,

67
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:58,477
I made my way from the slums of Myr
to the small council chamber.

68
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,941
Influence grows like a weed.

69
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,112
I tended mine patiently

70
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,867
until its tendrils reached
from the Red Keep all the way

71
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,954
across to the far side of the world
where I managed to wrap them

72
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,916
around something very special.

73
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,714
The sorcerer.

74
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,843
Hello, my old friend.

75
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,930
It's been a long time.

76
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,810
I have no doubt the revenge you want
will be yours in time,

77
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,064
if you have the stomach for it.

78
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,321
When people talk about the Night's Watch,
they never mention the shoveling.

79
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,323
Or the shit.

80
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,993
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

81
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:01,874
and protecting the realm,
but shoveling really is most of it.

82
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,628
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

83
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,922
And that. But when you're not getting
attacked or killed,

84
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,173
usually you're shoveling.

85
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,803
Look. More shit.

86
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,975
I was starting to wonder
what to do with the rest of my day.

87
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,601
We need to get out of here.

88
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,730
When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.

89
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,025
The Lord Commander told us
to go to the Fist of the First Men.

90
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,653
-How'd that turn out for us?
-He had no way of knowing.

91
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,739
We do now.
We know what's out there.

92
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,117
Craster's been out here surviving.

93
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,997
So, he's your new protector now?
Our good friend, Craster?

94
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,790
We're like the sons he never had.

95
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,293
Mormont isn't gonna save you.

96
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,295
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

97
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,964
When the walkers come calling,

98
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,174
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

99
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,553
If we want to live…

100
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,391
we'll have to look out for ourselves.

101
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,033
-You woke him.
-I'm sorry.

102
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,037
He's beautiful.

103
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
He's beautiful.

104
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,839
-Does he have a name?
-No.

105
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,092
-Are you going to give him one?
-Why?

106
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,725
-Here.
-Gilly.

107
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,311
You said to hold it for you
until you came back. You're back.

108
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,397
-I wanted you to have it.
-I don't want your stupid thimble.

109
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,067
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

110
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,735
Can you?

111
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,822
I don't have time for you.

112
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:02,703
I don't have time for anyone but him
because he doesn't have much time.

113
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,398
You have to go after him.

114
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,399
How?

115
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,818
You know how.

116
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,970
-Brandon.
-Mother.

117
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,805
How many times have I told you?

118
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,142
-No climbing.
-Mother, I need to find it.

119
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,351
-It's here. It's calling me.
-I want you to promise me.

120
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,063
No more climbing. Promise me.
Promise me!

121
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,857
-Promise me! Promise me!
-Mother! Mother!

122
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,067
-Mother!
-Promise me, Bran! Promise me!

123
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,293
-Is he very large?
-No larger than usual, apparently.

124
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,920
-And yet they said that he was…
-Extraordinary.

125
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,467
The most extraordinary man
they've had. And they've had a lot of men.

126
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,302
We're talking about the same Podrick?

127
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,556
The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?
Seems a bit simple?

128
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,559
What did he do to them?

129
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,396
I don't know, My Lord.
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

130
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,731
So, what did they say?

131
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,567
They said it was hard to describe.

132
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,240
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

133
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,120
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

134
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,916
He was too preoccupied to notice.
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

135
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,084
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

136
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:18,130
Yes, to pursue his enduring love
of the Lady Arryn

137
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
and the title that comes with her.

138
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,926
Sad, really.

139
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,139
Is that all it takes to make our friend
lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?

140
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,977
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.

141
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,730
But I don't think he's lost interest.

142
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,024
What makes you say so?

143
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,070
His shipboard inventory.

144
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,493
You can read.
Rare for a woman in your profession.

145
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,328
-Former profession.
-Of course.

146
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

147
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,045
Two featherbeds. He's bringing
two featherbeds for the cabin.

148
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,883
Who is important enough to Littlefinger

149
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,928
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

150
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,180
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

151
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,058
-He's not interested in them, My Lord.
-How do you know?

152
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,936
Because I'm one of his girls.

153
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,273
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

154
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:25,197
Rhaenyra, Targaryen was murdered
by her brother, or rather his dragon.

155
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,741
It ate her while her son watched.

156
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,329
What's left of her is buried in the crypts
right down there.

157
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,919
The ceremony is traditionally held
in the main sanctum,

158
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,547
which seats 700 comfortably.

159
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,801
There appears to be a good deal
of room elsewhere on the premises

160
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,094
for everyone else.

161
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,598
There aren't more than 700 people
of any importance.

162
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:55,853
No, the rest are there to look adoringly
upon the 700 to remind them

163
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,939
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

164
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,401
Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

165
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,903
Aerion Brightflame they called him.

166
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,990
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

167
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,242
He was wrong.

168
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,455
And, of course, there's the Mad King,
killed by my uncle.

169
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,417
Would you like to see
where the last Targaryens are buried?

170
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,545
Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

171
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,215
No, it's quite all right, Your Grace.
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

172
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,093
It's like taking a walk through history.

173
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,558
-The tomb's just up here.
-This is so exciting.

174
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,185
You were married here, Your Grace?

175
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,271
-Yes.
-Must seem like only yesterday.

176
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,731
Seems like a lifetime ago.

177
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,400
Your husband,
was he buried here as well?

178
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,612
No, he wanted his remains returned
to Storm's End.

179
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,448
-Such a tragedy.
-A fairly predictable tragedy.

180
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,243
-Hunting and drinking don't mix.
-I should say not.

181
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,496
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

182
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,248
he's never been
within a mile of a real battle.

183
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,669
I seem to recall,
he laid siege to Storm's End

184
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,003
for the better part of a year.

185
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,591
All he laid siege to was the banquet table
in the command tent.

186
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,885
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

187
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,971
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

188
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,977
We mothers do what we can
to keep our sons from the grave.

189
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,814
But they do seem to yearn for it.

190
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
We shower them with good sense

191
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,152
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

192
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,948
And yet the world belongs to them.

193
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,742
A ridiculous arrangement to my mind.

194
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,040
The Gods have seen fit to make it so.

195
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,502
My father didn't want them here.

196
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,755
He was going to have their bodies
burned and thrown in the Blackwater,

197
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,258
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

198
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm glad he did.

199
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,182
I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know
they did terrible things at the end,

200
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,477
but their ancestors built this.

201
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,817
Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.

202
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,071
I couldn't agree more.

203
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,791
Shall we go and see them?

204
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:29,048
If you give them your love,
they will return it a thousandfold.

205
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,552
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.

206
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,431
You led the defense of King's Landing.

207
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,726
They adore you.

208
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,694
Open the doors.

209
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,704
Joffrey.

210
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,665
Wait.

211
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,504
-Lady Margaery!
-Lady Margaery!

212
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
-Bless you!
-Lady Margaery!

213
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,716
-Lady Margaery!
-Lady Margaery!

214
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,427
-Margaery!
-Long live Lady Margaery!

215
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,054
King Joffrey!

216
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,559
King Joffrey! King Joffrey!

217
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,478
King Joffrey!

218
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,483
God bless you King Joffrey
and your future queen!

219
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,698
-How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
-Not far, My Lord.

220
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,243
Your sister is waiting for you there.

221
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,078
-She sent you to save me?
-Yes.

222
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,039
I served them,
the men who were torturing you.

223
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,126
I did what they told me
and waited for the right moment.

224
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
Why would you risk your life for me?

225
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,297
I grew up on Saltcliffe, My Lord.

226
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,300
I was only a boy when they took you away.

227
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,095
My father brought me
and my brothers up to the bluffs

228
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,347
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

229
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,892
I remember the look
on my father's face when he told us,

230
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,687
"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."

231
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,774
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

232
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,110
when I saw what they were doing to you.

233
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,111
Those men,

234
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,115
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

235
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,451
Did he?

236
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,037
I… I don't know, My Lord.

237
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,000
They… they never told me much.

238
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,555
My sister's men are loyal to her.
We don't need to hide from them.

239
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,684
Not all those are your sister's men.
Some of them are loyal to your father.

240
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,025
-What is it?
-I was just thinking how jealous I was

241
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,193
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

242
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,572
-What did he tell you to do?
-Raid fishing villages.

243
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,576
He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.

244
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,454
I could never be a Stark.

245
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,457
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.

246
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,043
-He lorded it over you?
-Didn't have to.

247
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,629
All he had to do was be.

248
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,174
Be who he was born to be.

249
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
His life fit him better than his clothes.

250
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,014
How could someone
like that ever be a brother to me?

251
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,308
He's the King in the North. And me…

252
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,896
My father gave me a choice and I made it.

253
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,733
I could never be a Stark.

254
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,693
But ironborn...

255
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,447
that's what I was born to be.

256
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,913
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.

257
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,130
I murdered those boys.

258
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,593
The Stark boys?

259
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,763
Never found them.

260
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,475
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

261
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,605
I let Dagmer slit their throats...

262
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,900
and I let him burn the bodies…

263
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,904
so I could keep Winterfell…

264
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,492
and make my father proud.

265
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,745
Maybe it's not too late.

266
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,084
It is.

267
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,220
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

268
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,932
I made a choice…

269
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,937
and I chose wrong.

270
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,984
And now I've burned everything down.

271
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,946
Not everything, My Lord.

272
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,826
She's up here.

273
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,007
Yara.

274
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,176
Wait.

275
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,815
-I brought him back. He killed the others.
-What? No, I didn't. You can't!

276
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,194
No, please stop!

277
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,073
No!

278
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,201
Put him back where he belongs.

279
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,268
Eat.

280
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,398
What are you doing?

281
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,861
-I'm dying.
-You can't die.

282
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,617
You need to live to take revenge.

283
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,411
I don't care about revenge.

284
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,747
You coward.

285
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,417
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

286
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
Misfor--

287
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,132
Misfortune?

288
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,719
-You lost your hand.
-My sword hand. I was that hand.

289
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,976
You have a taste,
one taste of the real world

290
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,105
where people have important things
taken from them

291
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,691
and you whine and cry and quit.

292
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,360
You sound like a bloody woman.

293
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,221
I know what you did for me.

294
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,267
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

295
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,275
It's called the Sapphire Isle
because of the blue of its water.

296
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,071
You knew that.

297
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,539
Why did you help me?

298
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,986
-You wanted to speak to me?
-Yes, about Jaime.

299
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,281
What about him?

300
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,118
I wanted to make sure we're doing
everything we can to get him back.

301
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,291
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner…

302
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,795
what did I do in response?

303
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,673
-You started a war.
-And if I would start a war

304
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,133
for that lecherous little stump,

305
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,887
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

306
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,888
Whatever you can.

307
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,641
Whatever I can.

308
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,739
-You're still here.
-Yes.

309
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,077
Why?

310
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,414
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be the one

311
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,834
who deserves your confidence
and your trust, not your sons?

312
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,128
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

313
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,173
Years and years of lectures on family
and legacy.

314
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,429
The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.

315
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,765
Did it ever occur to you
that your daughter might be the only one

316
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,809
listening to them, living by them?

317
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,771
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

318
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,108
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

319
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,118
All right. Contribute.

320
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,581
The Tyrells are a problem.

321
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,753
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

322
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,881
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

323
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,468
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

324
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,847
She knows how to manipulate him.

325
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,100
Good. I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

326
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,605
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

327
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,775
I distrust you because you're not as smart
as you think you are.

328
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,736
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

329
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,571
and everyone else in this city.

330
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:48,124
Perhaps, you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

331
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,089
I will.

332
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,304
-Do you like it, Nana?
-Another golden rose. How original.

333
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,850
I eat from plates stamped with roses.
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

334
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,269
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

335
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,732
as if that makes it smell any better.
Roses are boring, dear.

336
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,946
"Growing strong."
The dullest words of any house.

337
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,200
"Winter is coming!"
Now, that's memorable.

338
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,789
"We do not sow." Strong. Strong!
Those are houses you watch out for.

339
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,085
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

340
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:37,048
But a golden rose growing strong,
that strikes fear in the heart.

341
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,427
Look, little loves.

342
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,430
A spider in the garden.

343
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,851
Run along now. Grow strong.

344
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,272
My Lady.

345
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,650
I wanted to personally welcome you
to King's Landing.

346
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,153
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

347
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,697
The city is made brighter by my presence?

348
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:05,243
Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?
Are you here to seduce me?

349
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,329
-A little obvious, perhaps.
-No, please.

350
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,499
Seduce away. It's been so long.

351
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,752
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

352
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,506
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

353
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,176
A question for the philosophers.

354
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,721
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

355
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,681
-So?
-Might I sit?

356
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,682
No.

357
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,189
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

358
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,443
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

359
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,446
Have I? Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

360
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,574
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

361
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,993
Why shouldn't I take an interest?
She's an interesting girl.

362
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,953
-Is she?
-No, not particularly.

363
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:53,416
-But she's had an interesting childhood.
-She has, sadly.

364
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,961
Well, forgive me
for wasting your time, then.

365
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,881
I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

366
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,885
Come, come. You surrender rather easily.

367
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,806
Walk with me.
I know the walls have ears,

368
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,725
but apparently the shrubbery does too.

369
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,606
I choose my allies carefully
and my enemies more carefully still.

370
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,525
Which is Sansa Stark?

371
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,277
Neither. A babe in the woods.

372
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,488
-I admired her father.
-Yes.

373
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,492
Ned Stark had many admirers,
and how many stepped forward

374
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,161
when the executioner came
for his head?

375
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,871
I could not help Lord Stark.

376
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,873
-Perhaps I can help his daughter.
-How?

377
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,169
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

378
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,046
That's hardly surprising.

379
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,840
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

380
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,344
Indeed. She'd make a lovely match
for the right suitor.

381
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,305
It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.

382
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,726
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
A confidant of mine has told me

383
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,187
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

384
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,232
And why have you come to me
with this matter?

385
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,152
Littlefinger was born with no lands,
no wealth, no armies.

386
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,447
He has acquired the first two.
How long before he has the army?

387
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,533
Perhaps you'll laugh,

388
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,162
but I know him better than most
and this is the truth.

389
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,499
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

390
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:22,422
If Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

391
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,508
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

392
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,135
Which seems such a shame.

393
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,304
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

394
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,431
steal away such a lovely bride?

395
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,727
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

396
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,645
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

397
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,400
But he would see this country burn
if he could be king of the ashes.

398
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,362
-You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
-You are too kind.

399
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,907
I believe I have a possible solution.

400
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,536
One doesn't need to be clever for that.
It's all rather obvious, isn't it?

401
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,135
-I didn't mean to disturb you.
-You haven't.

402
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,055
We'd like some privacy, please.

403
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,349
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

404
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,728
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

405
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,897
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

406
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,362
What did you pray for?

407
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,198
-I can't tell you.
-Why not?

408
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,326
I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

409
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,663
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

410
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,082
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

411
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,834
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.

412
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,630
-And you?
-I'm sorry, I just can't.

413
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:50,677
My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

414
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,596
When I was 12,
I was all elbows and knees and Alanna

415
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,308
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
Pig-face, she called me.

416
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,102
Pig-face? That's ridiculous.

417
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,229
I think it had something to do
with my nose.

418
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,606
Whenever she passed me in the halls,
she'd oink.

419
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,612
So, I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

420
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,156
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

421
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,575
-Porridge plague?
-You don't have it in the North?

422
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,036
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats

423
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,747
and eventually your face slides off
and you die in agony.

424
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,457
But that's awful.

425
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,840
You're… I believed you!

426
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,009
-Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
-Don't say that. No, you're not.

427
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,512
So, what happened to Alanna?

428
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,808
She grew up to be the most beautiful woman
and married a handsome lord

429
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,353
and they have darling children
and live in a castle by the sea.

430
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,855
It's all terribly frustrating.

431
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,983
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

432
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:51,195
You'll be married here in the capital
and she'll have to come watch

433
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,531
and pretend to be happy
that you're queen.

434
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,454
I want us to be friends, good friends.

435
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,165
That would make me very happy.

436
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,545
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

437
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,257
We have a great masquerade
the night of the harvest moon.

438
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,843
You should see the costumes.
People work on them for months.

439
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,265
I… I don't think the queen
would let me leave King's Landing.

440
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:23,102
The Queen Regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

441
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,025
And if you were to marry Loras…

442
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,448
Your place would be at Highgarden,
wouldn't it?

443
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,743
We would be sisters, you and I.

444
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,495
Would you like that?

445
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,260
His name was Bannen.

446
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,264
He was a good man, a good ranger.

447
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,850
He came to us from…

448
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,564
-Where did he come from?
-Down White Harbor way.

449
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,778
He came to us from White Harbor.
Never failed in his duty.

450
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:21,744
He kept his vows the best he could.
He rode far, fought fiercely.

451
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,749
We shall never see his like again.

452
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,794
-And now his watch has ended.
-And now his watch has ended.

453
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,214
And now his watch has ended.

454
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,555
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

455
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,558
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

456
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,186
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

457
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,690
Craster's got his daughters to feed.
You on his side?

458
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,109
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

459
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,279
We're brothers of the Night's Watch,
not thieves.

460
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:01,492
The day we leave,
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine

461
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,871
and sit down
to a feast of ham and potatoes

462
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,082
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

463
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,130
He's a bloody wildling is all he is.

464
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,968
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

465
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,649
You have one son, don't you, Mormont?

466
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,903
I had my 99th.

467
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,657
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

468
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,120
And more daughters than I can count.

469
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,123
-I'm glad for you.
-Are you now?

470
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,419
Me, I'll be glad
when you and yours have gone.

471
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,463
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

472
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,884
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

473
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,178
Them that's dying,

474
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,348
why don't you cut their throats
and be done with it?

475
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,771
Or leave them if you've not the stomach
and I'll sort them myself.

476
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,775
Whose throat are you gonna cut, old man?

477
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,239
-Wait outside.
-It's cold outside.

478
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,077
-And there's nothing to eat.
-My wives gave you bread.

479
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,828
There's sawdust in the bread.

480
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,625
You don't like it, you go out there
and eat the snow.

481
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,425
I'd rather eat
what you've got hidden away.

482
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,931
I told you to wait outside.

483
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,268
He's sitting there drinking our wine,
eating his fill while we die.

484
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,481
I gave you crows enough.
I've got to feed my women!

485
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,858
So, you admit
you've got a hidden larder then?

486
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,946
-How else you make it through a winter?
-Enough! Out!

487
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,408
-I am a godly man.
-You're a stingy bastard!

488
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,620
Bastard? Out with you, you little thief.

489
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,748
And you! And you!

490
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,545
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.

491
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,010
I'll chop the hands off the next man
who calls me bastard.

492
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,193
You are a bastard.

493
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,324
A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.

494
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,001
The Gods will curse us for this.

495
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,588
-By all the laws--
-There are no laws beyond the Wall.

496
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,924
Now, show us where he hides the food
or you'll get the same as he did.

497
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,012
Unhand her.
I shall have your head for this.

498
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,441
-Quickly. Quickly.
-What's happening?

499
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,611
-I'm not going out there.
-No, we have to go. Now!

500
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,327
Follow me. I know the best way.

501
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,831
Come on.

502
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,382
Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!

503
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,677
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

504
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,727
-Can I take this hood off yet?
-I do apologize, Little Lady,

505
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,980
but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.

506
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,317
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

507
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,070
Halt!

508
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,704
-What is it?
-Blackstrap rum.

509
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,960
-Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
-I'd have some.

510
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,091
Let's go home.

511
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,276
What is this place?

512
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,321
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

513
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,126
-You look like a bunch of swineherds.
-Some of us were swineherds.

514
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,714
And some of us tanners
and masons. That was before.

515
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:53,552
You're still swineherds
and tanners and masons.

516
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,305
You think carrying a crooked spear
makes you a soldier?

517
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,932
No.

518
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,311
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

519
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,521
Beric Dondarrion?

520
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,484
-You've seen better days.
-And I won't see them again.

521
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,907
Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.

522
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,452
You lot aren't fighting in a war.
You're running from it.

523
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,080
Last I heard,
you were King Joffrey's guard dog.

524
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:26,752
But here you are 1,000 miles from home.
Which of us is running?

525
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,629
Untie these ropes and we'll find out.

526
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,633
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

527
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,637
Ned Stark ordered me to execute
your brother in King Robert's name.

528
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,183
Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead.

529
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,102
My brother's alive.

530
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,066
-You're fighting for ghosts.
-That's what we are,

531
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,153
ghosts. Waiting for you in the dark.

532
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,283
You can't see us, but we see you.

533
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,454
No matter whose cloak you wear,
Lannister, Stark, Baratheon,

534
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,750
you prey on the weak,
the Brotherhood without Banners

535
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,212
-will hunt you down.
-You found God? Is that it?

536
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,591
Aye. I've been reborn
in the light of the one true God.

537
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,760
As have we all.

538
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,680
As would any man who's seen
the things we've seen.

539
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,808
If you mean to murder me,
then bloody well get on with it.

540
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,727
You'll die soon enough, dog.

541
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,150
-But it won't be murder, only justice.
-And a kinder fate than you deserve.

542
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,153
Lions you call yourselves.
At the Mummer's Ford,

543
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:38,282
girls of seven years were raped
and babes still on the breast

544
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,117
were cut in two
while their mothers watched.

545
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,910
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.

546
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,830
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

547
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,291
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

548
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,752
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

549
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,172
-before the Iron Throne.
-Do you take me for my brother?

550
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,592
-Is being born Clegane a crime?
-Murder is a crime.

551
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,844
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

552
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:03,390
I never saw them, never smelled them,
never heard them bawling.

553
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,560
You want to cut my throat, get on with it!

554
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,106
But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

555
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,028
You murdered Mycah.
The butcher's boy. My friend.

556
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:21,241
He was 12 years old. He was unarmed.
And you rode him down.

557
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,703
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

558
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,622
Aye, he was a bleeder.

559
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,210
-You don't deny killing this boy?
-I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

560
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,462
-The boy attacked the prince.
-That's a lie!

561
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:38,592
-I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
-Then I should have killed you.

562
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,636
Not my place to question princes.

563
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,515
You stand accused of murder.

564
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,518
But no one here
knows the truth of the charge,

565
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,312
so it is not for us to judge you.

566
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,481
Only the Lord of Light may do that now.

567
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,860
I sentence you to trial by combat.

568
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,989
So, who will it be?

569
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:06,328
Should we find out if your Fire God
really loves you, priest?

570
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,666
Or you, archer? What are you worth
with a sword in your hand?

571
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,294
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

572
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,050
Aye. She might be.

573
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,513
But it's me you'll fight.

574
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,831
The master says they are untested.

575
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,628
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

576
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,132
There are many small cities
between here and there,

577
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,675
cities ripe for sacking.

578
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,762
Should you take captives,

579
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,974
the masters will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

580
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,521
And who knows?

581
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,693
In ten years,
some of the boys you send them

582
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,113
may be Unsullied in their turn.
Thus, all shall prosper.

583
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,504
Is it done then? They belong to me?

584
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,259
It is done.

585
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,720
You hold the whip.

586
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,647
Dracarys.
