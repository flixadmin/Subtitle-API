1
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,755
<i>People are peculiar creatures.</i>

2
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:25,046
<i>All their actions are driven by desire,</i>

3
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:30,671
<i>their characters forged by pain.</i>

4
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,630
<i>As much as they might try
to suppress the pain,</i>

5
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,046
<i>to repress desire,</i>

6
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,880
<i>they cannot liberate themselves
from eternal servitude to their feelings.</i>

7
00:00:57,546 --> 00:01:00,130
<i>As long as the storm rages within them</i>

8
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,380
<i>they can find no peace.</i>

9
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,796
<i>Not in life,</i>

10
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,588
<i>not in death.</i>

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,338
<i>And so, day after day,
they will do all that must be done.</i>

12
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:19,755
<i>Pain is their ship,</i>

13
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,088
<i>desire their compass.</i>

14
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,171
<i>All that humankind is capable of.</i>

15
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,171
JUNE 26, 1954

16
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:02,921
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

17
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,380
The deceased woman is 5' 7".

18
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,838
Caucasian.

19
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,630
Probably 75

20
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,588
to 80 years old.

21
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,380
Cause of death, a shot to the chest.

22
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,338
The eyes are notable.

23
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,546
One blue, one brown.

24
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,880
It's known as heterochromia.

25
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,421
This woman, she...

26
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,671
She was at the police station.

27
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,380
The same day Helge reappeared.

28
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,171
And?

29
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:46,796
She was confused.

30
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,963
Not entirely there.

31
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:53,046
She apologized for something, I...

32
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,005
I didn't understand for what.

33
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,546
The same day Helge came back?

34
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:07,213
Maybe she's the madman's accomplice.

35
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:09,755
Could be his mother.

36
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,296
And she had Helge with her the whole time.

37
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,213
There's something else.

38
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,921
I only happened upon it by chance.

39
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,380
Her body

40
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,755
is heavily contaminated.

41
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,630
Here.

42
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,046
All over.

43
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:39,380
She must've been exposed
to heavy radiation for a prolonged period.

44
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,838
Peculiar.

45
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:44,421
Perhaps she worked as a radiographer.

46
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,005
A radiographer?

47
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,671
Visit the Doppler boy. Show him her photo.
Maybe he'll recognize her.

48
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,880
<i>The data indicates</i>

49
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,130
that the particle regularly decays
into two protons,

50
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,921
at a mass of 125 gigaelectronvolts.

51
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,963
In one case, however,
it decayed into four muons.

52
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,130
You're already here?

53
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,588
I must've lost track of time.

54
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,838
What day is it?

55
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:41,838
It's...

56
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,546
June 26.

57
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,421
Did you spend all night here?

58
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,046
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

59
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:52,171
June 26...

60
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,171
Is something wrong?

61
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:02,838
I rescheduled the meeting with the French
for this morning.

62
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:08,713
Ms. Tiedemann?

63
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,088
Mom?

64
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:45,713
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR?

65
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,838
It all has to do with me.

66
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:03,463
Noah said the world will end tomorrow.

67
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,130
And that only the people
in the bunker will survive.

68
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,963
And he said she's alive.

69
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,671
My mother.

70
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:45,463
The documents
from the Marburg passport office are here.

71
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,671
As you suspected,

72
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:54,005
in that time frame there's only one entry
for an Aleksander Köhler.

73
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:59,588
And then the eyes saw, the ears heard
and nothing remained concealed.

74
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:01,463
Freud?

75
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,838
Tell Mr. Wöller.

76
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,796
We have to tell someone.

77
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,255
Who then? And what exactly?

78
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,046
Do you have anything to say?

79
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,713
I think he's here.

80
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,255
Who?

81
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,505
Jonas.

82
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,755
I think Bartosz is right. He's back.

83
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:48,505
We traveled through time
and that's all that interests you?

84
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,546
You said he's part of it.
Unlike you, he might know what this means.

85
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,046
Maybe he knows where Dad or Mikkel is,
or who knows what!

86
00:09:58,588 --> 00:09:59,880
Magnus is right.

87
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,880
We have to tell someone.

88
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,921
Everyone has been up to
their own shit for months.

89
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,421
Everyone's silent.

90
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,213
What good has that done? None at all.

91
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:16,755
Okay.

92
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,463
Then we should do it.

93
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,630
We?

94
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,630
There is no "we."

95
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,296
There never has been.

96
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,838
- What does that mean?
- You knew what was going on for months.

97
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:38,963
You never told me or anyone else here.

98
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:53,088
Do whatever you want.

99
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,005
<i>I hope it won't take too long.</i>

100
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,088
Helge is still very exhausted.

101
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:23,005
Do you know this woman?

102
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,255
Answer the sergeant.

103
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,255
Were you with her maybe?

104
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,296
Did she lock you in?

105
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:45,088
He told me about her.

106
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,421
The White Devil.

107
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:58,630
Who?

108
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:01,963
Who told you about her?

109
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,963
The man who did that to you?

110
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,338
The White Devil.

111
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,255
Tell me about

112
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,588
the White Devil.

113
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,796
She wants to kill us.

114
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,421
All of us.

115
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:54,255
She's dead.
She can't hurt anyone anymore.

116
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:00,255
But she hasn't even started yet.

117
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,838
- Claudia?
- Hey, Dad.

118
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,630
Shouldn't you be at work?

119
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,921
I took the day off.

120
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,838
Is everything all right?

121
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,255
We discussed you moving in with us.

122
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,171
I...

123
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,046
Already forgotten?

124
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,963
You said I should think it over.

125
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,088
I just thought...

126
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:39,671
why waste time?

127
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,421
Then you'll be out of here.

128
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,546
I like it here.

129
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,296
I have to go.

130
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,338
To the hospital.

131
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,630
My first chemo.

132
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,838
Can I...

133
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:04,505
maybe join you?

134
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,505
That is, only if you'd like.

135
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,296
That'd be nice.

136
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,588
What do you want here?
I've already told you everything.

137
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:31,921
I'd like you to look at something.

138
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:33,713
Mr. Wöller?

139
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,671
What is it?

140
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:45,005
A copy of a document
from the Marburg Registry Office.

141
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:49,255
The info on your last ID
before you left Marburg.

142
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,671
I've no idea how this is relevant.

143
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,505
Nothing stands out?

144
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,296
No. What should stand out?

145
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,296
5' 6", I'd say. Tops.

146
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,213
That document says 5' 8".

147
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,713
So where are they?

148
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:17,796
Where are what?

149
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,546
The two inches.

150
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,671
This is ridiculous.

151
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:29,255
I'm arresting you.

152
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,963
On suspicion of identity theft.

153
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,130
You can't.

154
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,630
Hannah?

155
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,713
Hannah?

156
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,255
Anyone home?

157
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,296
Hello?

158
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,130
Hello?

159
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,130
Hannah, if you're home,
please open the door.

160
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,171
Pardon me. I...

161
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,338
Who are you?

162
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,338
Please come in.

163
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,588
I...

164
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,755
I... I wanted to talk to Hannah.

165
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,088
She's not here.

166
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:08,255
Want a drink?

167
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:14,963
Do I scare you?

168
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,338
I don't want to.

169
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:23,546
I think
I'm just having déjà vu or something.

170
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,296
- I'm going.
- A glitch in the matrix.

171
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,838
What?

172
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:40,755
Or a message from beyond.

173
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,005
You read that somewhere.

174
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,755
How do you know that?

175
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:57,921
You found the pendant.

176
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:13,338
Jonas?

177
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:32,880
Do you think
that I was a good police officer?

178
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,671
Oh, Dad. No idea.

179
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,130
I'm sure you were good at what you did.

180
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:48,046
Actually, I don't think so.

181
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:05,255
You were always different.

182
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:11,838
You saw the world differently
from the very start.

183
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,046
Sometimes I think

184
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:26,255
that that's my problem.

185
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:31,255
That I can't see the world as it truly is.

186
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,130
I think I did something very, very stupid.

187
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,338
What do you mean?

188
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,755
Do you know that movie?

189
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:50,171
The one with the young man
who has this car

190
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,421
that can take him to the past?

191
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:56,171
I know this sounds crazy,

192
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,588
but...

193
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,171
the stuff in that movie

194
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,838
really exists.

195
00:20:08,588 --> 00:20:10,380
Time travel.

196
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,796
And somehow...

197
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:23,005
it has all got to do with Mads and Helge.

198
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,213
And with things

199
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:29,046
that happened over 30 years ago.

200
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,338
Mr. Tiedemann!

201
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,046
Mr. Tiedemann.

202
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:48,380
A woman's waiting for you in your office.

203
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,796
Did she say what she wanted?

204
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,963
It's about the man in the asylum.

205
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,088
The one who killed the boys.

206
00:20:58,255 --> 00:20:59,838
She says she knows him.

207
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,046
Thanks.

208
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,088
Hello.

209
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:28,088
Hello.

210
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,671
How can I help you?

211
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:44,713
I...

212
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,005
I'm looking for my husband.

213
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:52,296
It was in the paper.

214
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,213
The dead children.

215
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,755
And there was a photo.

216
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,130
I think it's my husband.

217
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,338
Is that your husband?

218
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:35,463
There's a resemblance.

219
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:38,963
We looked for relatives.
No one came forward.

220
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:44,380
You know he was arrested last winter
for multiple murders?

221
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:49,880
Can I see him?

222
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:54,088
It's not that simple, he's...

223
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,588
currently in a psychiatric facility.

224
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,921
He won't talk.

225
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:05,171
I see.

226
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,046
But maybe he'll talk to me.

227
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,755
May I ask you what your name is?

228
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,213
Nielsen.

229
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,338
Katharina Nielsen.

230
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,421
Where were you all this time?

231
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,213
I promised you
I'd make it all right again.

232
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:01,588
I'm so sorry.

233
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,921
Suddenly it all makes sense.

234
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:37,046
Once you know, it's obvious.

235
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:51,463
Hannah?

236
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,463
Hannah, open the door!

237
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,421
Hannah?

238
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:58,546
Hannah!

239
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,838
Martha, don't.

240
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:00,963
Please.

241
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:15,088
Martha?

242
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,921
You know who this is? Hm?

243
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,130
Did he tell you where your brother is?

244
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,046
Who your brother is?

245
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,588
That man

246
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:32,546
is your brother's son.

247
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,421
My grandson, your nephew.

248
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,046
Mikkel is Michael Kahnwald.
You hear me, Martha?

249
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,421
And you are his aunt.

250
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,005
Martha.

251
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,796
I'm so sorry.

252
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,088
I'm sorry.

253
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:02,171
I... Believe me, I really wanted to...

254
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,338
Where's your machine?

255
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:07,171
The one you can travel through time with?

256
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,421
Hannah's got it.

257
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,921
She's vanished.

258
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:15,630
Hannah?

259
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,546
Tell me how I can get Mikkel back!

260
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,630
Mom...

261
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,463
Magnus has the device.

262
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,838
What?

263
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,963
We traveled with it.

264
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,005
You were there?

265
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,088
Did you see Mikkel?

266
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,421
Mikkel?

267
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,213
Keep your filthy fingers off her.

268
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:54,296
You got me?

269
00:26:56,171 --> 00:26:57,421
Come on.

270
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:17,088
What is this?

271
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:19,380
My brother

272
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,838
also vanished without a trace.

273
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,005
In 1986.

274
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:29,963
Much like
Mads Nielsen's disappearance here.

275
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,588
Not a trace.

276
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:37,171
Nothing.

277
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,796
His name was Aleksander too.

278
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:43,088
Aleksander Köhler.

279
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,671
Just like yours.

280
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:50,921
A common name.

281
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:58,588
To be precise, there are
over 700 Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

282
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:04,838
It isn't all that easy to track down
every Aleksander Köhler.

283
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,713
Particularly when they've assumed
their wife's maiden name.

284
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,005
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

285
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,963
When my parents split,
I took my mother's last name.

286
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,380
I went from Köhler to Clausen.

287
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,755
For some people
I'm still untraceable to this day.

288
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,671
But,

289
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:34,963
a couple of months ago,

290
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,005
this happened.

291
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,588
Read it.

292
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,213
Out loud.

293
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,421
"He that has eyes to see

294
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:24,921
and ears to hear

295
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:30,338
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret.

296
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:34,088
If his lips are silent...

297
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,380
- ...he chatters...
- ...he chatters with his fingertips.

298
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:42,880
- Betrayal oozes...
- ...out of him at every pore.

299
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:48,921
You'll find the answers
concerning your brother in Winden.

300
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,546
A friend."

301
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:56,546
I have no idea

302
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,921
what's going on in this town.

303
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,171
But I'm very certain of one thing.

304
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:11,380
You...

305
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:19,921
are definitely not my brother.

306
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:41,088
Your husband never confessed.

307
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:44,921
He kept insisting
he wanted to save the children.

308
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:48,588
You and your husband...

309
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:52,463
You have children, right?

310
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:54,171
No.

311
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,713
No.

312
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:58,921
Strange.

313
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:03,255
He kept saying he was looking for his son.

314
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,296
This may sound a bit odd, but...

315
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:16,713
Have you ever heard of a "White Devil"?

316
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,880
No. What is that supposed to be?

317
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,630
If he talks to you...

318
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:33,671
That is, if he should talk to you,

319
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:37,088
persuade him to talk to the police.

320
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:41,463
Persuade him to confess.

321
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,796
And the man came from the future?

322
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,380
Back to 1953?

323
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:52,130
That's when you arrested him.

324
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:55,671
And yesterday
that man tried to kidnap the boy?

325
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:58,338
No.

326
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,713
Not that man.

327
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,296
I mean...

328
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:05,796
the same man,

329
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,338
but older.

330
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,171
Because he's allegedly his son?

331
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,005
I know.

332
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:17,671
It all sounds completely insane.

333
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,963
The man,

334
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,338
the old man.

335
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,380
Where is he now?

336
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,755
Back in psychiatric care.

337
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:35,921
That's enough. You're moving in with us.

338
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:39,630
We'll get your things now.

339
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:42,921
So you believe me.

340
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,755
So you...

341
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:53,880
traveled with it?

342
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,463
To what year?

343
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,921
To what year?

344
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:12,046
So that's what's going on.

345
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,505
You knew about this time travel shit?

346
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,130
Why didn't you say anything?

347
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,213
Martha.

348
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,713
Yes. At Franziska's.

349
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:28,338
Yes, I'll be right home.

350
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,338
You what?

351
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,296
Who?

352
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,796
Jonas is back.

353
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:46,921
Like Bartosz said.

354
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,421
But he's older.

355
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:58,838
You guys should stay out of this.

356
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,088
Unbelievable.

357
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,546
So you two knew it too.

358
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,921
That's exactly what ruins everything!

359
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:14,088
All your fucking secrets!

360
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:18,046
You couldn't even talk to us
when Dad screwed Benni!

361
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,713
What incompetent assholes you are!

362
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:22,630
Franziska.

363
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:37,630
<i>K-53.</i>

364
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,588
I'd like a moment alone with him.

365
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,255
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

366
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:03,630
Please.

367
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,088
Just five minutes.

368
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,630
As you wish.

369
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,713
Ulrich?

370
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:01,921
Ulrich.

371
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,296
Ulrich, it's me.

372
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:09,588
Hannah.

373
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:13,213
Hannah.

374
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,671
Ulrich, it's me.

375
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,005
Is it really you?

376
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,963
Yes.

377
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:26,755
Or are you an angel?

378
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,463
Are you an angel?

379
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,921
- Is it you?
- Yes.

380
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:46,921
It's you.

381
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,255
Do you know where Mikkel is?

382
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,255
And Katharina? How is Katharina?

383
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,421
Martha? Magnus?

384
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:15,713
It's so different seeing you again.

385
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,171
What?

386
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,630
If you could choose today,

387
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,630
between Katharina and me?

388
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,338
What do you mean?

389
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,380
Why?

390
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,588
Back when we were together, you...

391
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,963
I...

392
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,588
I tried to remember if you...

393
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,963
if you ever said "I love you" to me.

394
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:53,421
I loved you.

395
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,713
I still love you.

396
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,213
Get me out and I'll leave Katharina.

397
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,380
I love you.

398
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,588
Okay?

399
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,796
I love you.

400
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:17,921
He said I need no one.

401
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,255
But the truth is

402
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,921
you don't need me.

403
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,296
Yes, yes. I need you, Hannah.

404
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,755
I love you.

405
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:30,588
You've got to get me out.

406
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,380
I'll do anything you want.

407
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:36,296
Get me out of here, please.

408
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,046
Hannah, I love you.

409
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:40,463
You hear me?

410
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,130
I love you.

411
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,046
Hannah. Stay!

412
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,505
I love you.

413
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:50,088
You fucking cunt!

414
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,796
Stay! Stay with me!

415
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,005
Stay with me!

416
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,296
I love you!

417
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,338
She's a liar!

418
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,171
There are similarities, but...

419
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:06,546
Hannah!

420
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:08,171
I love you!

421
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,838
That's not my husband.

422
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:20,546
Get me out of here!

423
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,255
Get me out of here!

424
00:40:38,046 --> 00:40:39,255
Mom?

425
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:01,796
Everything will be fine.

426
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,088
Okay?

427
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:13,255
You got the machine?

428
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,963
Do you know how it works?

429
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,880
I...

430
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:44,838
don't.

431
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,963
Bartosz used it.

432
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:09,838
They're alive.

433
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:13,546
Mikkel.

434
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,963
And Dad.

435
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:17,755
What?

436
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,546
They're just not here.

437
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,921
They're in another time.

438
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,838
Just grab your pills quick.
We'll come back for everything else.

439
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,046
I just need a minute.

440
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:46,630
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,671
I wonder

442
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,171
why he wanted
to go into the caves with him.

443
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,755
Maybe there's something there,
in the caves.

444
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:02,005
Dad, stop.

445
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:15,755
But he wanted to go there in 1953 too.

446
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,130
And again now.

447
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,338
- Maybe there's something...
- There's nothing in the caves.

448
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:27,505
But there must be some reason
he wanted to go in there.

449
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:35,046
Can we go now?

450
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:52,005
Why are you really here?

451
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:56,046
What do you mean by that?

452
00:43:56,838 --> 00:43:58,338
You know.

453
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,963
What do I know?

454
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:03,755
You know about the time travel.

455
00:44:06,671 --> 00:44:10,588
- It's related to the nuclear power plant.
- I'd like to go now!

456
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,005
You're involved in all of this.

457
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:20,755
Don't be ridiculous.

458
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,838
We have to have the caves searched.

459
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:29,713
There's nothing in the caves!
There is no time travel!

460
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:51,130
- What are you doing?
- Calling the station.

461
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:53,255
To have them search the caves.

462
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:57,671
You're clueless.

463
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:01,338
What's in the caves eclipses
all scientific discovery.

464
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:04,880
That substance turns all we know
about the universe on its head.

465
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,963
And you want to risk all of that?
For nothing?

466
00:45:11,963 --> 00:45:14,171
You haven't changed.

467
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:21,713
It's still all about you.

468
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:25,880
You have no heart.

469
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:31,338
Let go.

470
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,421
Let go!

471
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:43,588
Oh God, Dad!

472
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:46,921
Stay right there.

473
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,380
Don't move.

474
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:52,671
I...

475
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,963
I'll call an ambulance.

476
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:06,463
Come on.

477
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,421
Come on!

478
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,088
<i>Winden Emergency Services,
how can I help?</i>

479
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:15,755
<i>Hello?</i>

480
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:17,671
<i>Hell...</i>

481
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,880
"You'll have to make sacrifices."

482
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:43,005
"Everything will happen as it always has."

483
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,421
"But if everything goes right,
she'll live."

484
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:48,963
Regina.

485
00:47:10,255 --> 00:47:11,921
I'm so sorry.

486
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:21,046
You are the White Devil.

487
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:52,421
You're sure he wasn't your husband?

488
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,171
I...

489
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:05,380
should've reacted quicker.

490
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,338
- I'm sorry.
- Don't blame yourself.

491
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:17,755
Nielsen...

492
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,796
That's an...

493
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:23,588
uncommon name.

494
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:25,671
Do you know an Agnes Nielsen?

495
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:27,713
No.

496
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:36,546
You're traveling back today?

497
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:43,421
I lost everything where I came from.

498
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:48,130
All I want is a fresh start.

499
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:42,421
SLEEPING OVER AT A FRIEND'S, R.

500
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,046
Who are you?

501
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,630
Why do you have a key to my house?

502
00:53:06,546 --> 00:53:09,088
You gave it to me before you left.

503
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,630
Nonsense.

504
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:14,588
I don't even know you.

505
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,088
She gave it to you.

506
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:31,630
My older self.

507
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,296
We've got to go.
We don't have much time.

508
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,963
I don't understand.

509
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:54,713
I know what you did.

510
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,255
She told me.

511
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:16,088
But she also said
it didn't have to happen that way again.

512
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:21,296
Next time.

513
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,838
