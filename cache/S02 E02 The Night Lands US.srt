1
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,689
Boy.

2
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,983
Lovely boy.

3
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,070
-What do you want?
-A man has a thirst.

4
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,698
A man does not drink
for a day and a night.

5
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,577
-A boy could make a friend.
-I have friends.

6
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,872
Get us beer before I skin you.

7
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,250
A man does not choose his companions.

8
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,004
These two, they have no courtesy.
A man must ask forgiveness.

9
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,134
You're called Arry.

10
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,431
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.

11
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:07,145
-Once of the Free City of Lorath.
-Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!

12
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,314
You should've asked nicely.

13
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,364
Come closer and I'll shove
that stick up your bunghole

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,450
and fuck you bloody!

15
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,911
A boy has more courage than sense.

16
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,203
Come here!

17
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,289
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

18
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,541
-Come here!
-They don't scare me.

19
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,878
Then you're stupid. They scare me.

20
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,344
What are Gold Cloaks doing
so far from King's Landing?

21
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,809
-What you doing?
-They're looking for me.

22
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,520
You in command here?

23
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,901
-You're a long way from home.
-I asked you a question.

24
00:03:55,526 --> 00:04:00,031
Aye, you did.
But you asked without manners.

25
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,659
And I chose not to answer.

26
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,827
I have a royal warrant

27
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,623
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

28
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,216
Well, the thing is, these gutter
rats belong to the Night's Watch now.

29
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,594
That puts them beyond
the reach of kings and queens.

30
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,720
Does it?

31
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,390
It's a funny thing.

32
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,103
People worry so much about their throats
that they forget about what's down low.

33
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,524
Now, I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

34
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,653
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to.

35
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,742
Or I could nick this artery in your leg
and once it's nicked,

36
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,912
there's no one around here
that knows how to unnick it.

37
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,708
We'll just keep that.

38
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,170
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.

39
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,007
It seems you have a choice.

40
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,553
You can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

41
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,264
or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters

42
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,766
you didn't find what you were looking for.

43
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,736
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
He carries a bull's head helmet.

44
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,532
Anyone turning him over will earn
the king's reward.

45
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,410
We'll be back with more men.

46
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,955
And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

47
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,159
My lord.

48
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,829
You make me wait a long time.
But your friend keeps me company.

49
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,707
We were just speaking of your bravery

50
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,752
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

51
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,129
It was quite a battle.

52
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,592
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

53
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,970
The Northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

54
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,765
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

55
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,770
To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens,

56
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,939
it almost beggars belief.

57
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,775
Strange things do happen.

58
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,239
-You should taste her fish pie.
-I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

59
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,408
-How can you tell?
-I can always tell.

60
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,496
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

61
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,581
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

62
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,003
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

63
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,632
Friends are such
an important part of life.

64
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,344
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

65
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,805
But rest easy my lord,

66
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,143
I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.

67
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,148
Your discretion is legendary,
where your friends are concerned.

68
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,735
How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.

69
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,070
I will leave you.

70
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,324
Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.

71
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,452
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

72
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,830
We have a council meeting, my lord.

73
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,296
-I don't like threats.
-Well, who threatened you?

74
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,465
I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way
this game is played.

75
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,302
-Ned Stark was a man of honor.
-And I am not.

76
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,305
Threaten me again and I will have you
thrown into the sea.

77
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,519
You might be disappointed in the results.

78
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,774
The storms come and go,
the big fish eat the little fish,

79
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,068
and I keep on paddling.

80
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,532
Come, my lord.
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

81
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,542
From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm

82
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,921
but a free and independent
kingdom of the North.

83
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,719
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

84
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,347
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

85
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,893
We can give him his father's bones back,
at least, as a gesture of good faith.

86
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,270
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

87
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,731
I will, Your Grace.

88
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,360
Did you see my brother
when you were the Starks' guest?

89
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,280
I did. They have not broken his spirit,
Your Grace.

90
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,828
If you speak with him...
tell him he's not been forgotten.

91
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,082
-I will, Your Grace.
-Safe travels, cousin.

92
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,755
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

93
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,131
If that's everything.

94
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,178
A raven flew in this morning
from Castle Black.

95
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,849
-Trouble with the wildlings.
-That's why they're called wildlings.

96
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,477
Somewhat less wild these days.

97
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,730
Seems they've stopped killing each other
and started following

98
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,899
this "King-Beyond-the Wall."

99
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,861
Another king? How many is that now?
Five. I've lost count.

100
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,116
The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.

101
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,035
Perhaps he's forgotten that we're fighting
a war. We have no men to spare.

102
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,790
The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them.

103
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,294
The Northerners
are a superstitious people.

104
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,631
According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.

105
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,550
Mormont doesn't lie.

106
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,389
-How do you kill a dead man?
-Apparently, you burn him.

107
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,812
One trip to the Wall and you come back
believing in grumkins and snarks.

108
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,067
I don't know what I believe.
But here's a fact for you.

109
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,654
Night's Watch is the only thing
that separates us

110
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,156
from what lies beyond the Wall.

111
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,869
I have every confidence that the brave men
of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

112
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,207
...and I said, if the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

113
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,460
they wouldn't make us fart when we died.

114
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,088
We fart when we die?

115
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,010
My blessed mother, I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

116
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,929
She farted so hard the whole bed shook.

117
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,234
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

118
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,239
-Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
-We were having a serious discussion.

119
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,826
Would you look at that.

120
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,206
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

121
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
I prefer watching them come towards me.

122
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,419
I'm sure that's nice too.

123
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,921
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid

124
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,549
named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.

125
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,844
And we were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old,

126
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,765
and then we got older and the wrestling...

127
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,727
changed.

128
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,981
You were with her? How many times?

129
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,484
Well, as many times as I could.

130
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,031
I wish I grew up on a farm.

131
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,868
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.

132
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,499
Get the turnips, too.

133
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,389
No. Ghost, no.

134
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,644
No. Ghost away. Shoo. Shoo!

135
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,945
-You all right? Did he frighten you?
-You... you shouldn't touch me.

136
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,327
Right. I'm sorry, I just wanted
to make sure you weren't hurt.

137
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,836
You're very brave.

138
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,681
What are you doing?

139
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,603
This is Gilly.
She's one of Craster's daughters.

140
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,648
-Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?
-Sam said you could help.

141
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,859
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we’re not supposed to--

142
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,943
She's pregnant.

143
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,912
We have to take her with us when we leave.

144
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,540
-What?
-I know it sounds a bit mad.

145
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,459
No, it doesn’t sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

146
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,586
-The Lord Commander ordered us--
-We are sworn to protect.

147
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,463
-Sam, we can't take her.
-Please, sir, please.

148
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,548
I can still run if I have to.

149
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,425
It's just not possible.

150
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm going to have a baby. If it's a boy...

151
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,305
If it's a boy what?

152
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,773
You want us to risk our lives for you,
and you won't even tell us why.

153
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,990
-Why'd you do that?
-Do what? Ask her a question?

154
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,742
-You were cruel.
-Cruel?

155
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,161
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

156
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,497
-I didn't touch her.
-No, you just want to steal her.

157
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,165
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

158
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,044
I can't steal her.
She's a person not a goat.

159
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,344
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

160
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,681
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it,

161
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,225
and even if he would,
what would we do with her?

162
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,561
Who's going to deliver a baby? You?

163
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,732
I could try. What? I've read about it.

164
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,402
A bit.

165
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm sorry, Sam. We can't help her.

166
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,174
Khaleesi.

167
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,014
-You don't need to see this.
-He is blood of my blood.

168
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,020
-Who did this?
-Khal Pono, perhaps.

169
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:25,651
Khal Jhaqo. They don't like the idea
of a woman leading a khalasar.

170
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,445
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

171
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,123
Is it as you remember, my lord?

172
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,083
It looks smaller.

173
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,211
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

174
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,006
I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.

175
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,674
Now look at it.

176
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,595
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

177
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,932
-Who will?
-Anyone who matters.

178
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,059
This is a big day for them.

179
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,229
They haven't had much
to get excited about since I left.

180
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:31,944
It's a hard place, the Iron Islands,
always has been. It's cold and it's wet.

181
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,698
-I love the cold and wet.
-They say hard places breed hard men.

182
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,494
And hard men rule the world.

183
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,082
And you'll be king before long.

184
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,045
Try smiling with your lips closed.

185
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,714
Better.

186
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,262
My father doesn't
trust you Iron Islanders.

187
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,972
I don't blame him.

188
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,517
He says that you're all reavers
and rapers,

189
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,895
and that no matter how many women
you have, you'll never be satis--

190
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,356
Quit talking about your father.

191
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,192
He's right about us.

192
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,823
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

193
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,074
But that's not enough for us.

194
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,871
That's why we take salt wives.
The women we capture.

195
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,414
Capture me.

196
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,334
Take me with you when you go ashore.
Make me your salt wife.

197
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,463
-Your place is on this ship.
-Not after you leave.

198
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,843
Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.

199
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,304
I haven't paid you.

200
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,673
Unbelievable.

201
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,384
Yes, but I'm not going to stand for this.

202
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
I barely touched her.

203
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,598
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.

204
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,099
And this is what I get? Crying?

205
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,310
One moment my friend, a moment.

206
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,865
Please accept my sincerest apologies.
Aremca will take good care of you.

207
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,939
I'm sorry, my lord.

208
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,444
Did he hurt you?

209
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,656
No, my lord.

210
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,744
-It's Mhaegen.
-Who?

211
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:34,001
She works for you. She's the one...

212
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,046
The gold cloaks, they killed her baby.

213
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:43,343
Yes. That was poorly handled.

214
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,057
Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.

215
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,061
I can't stop thinking about it.

216
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,731
I can't sleep.

217
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,609
That poor little baby.

218
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,946
You know, you remind me of another girl.

219
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,409
A lovely thing I once acquired
from a Lysene pleasure house.

220
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:15,292
Beautiful, like yourself.
And intelligent, like yourself.

221
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,586
But she wasn't happy.

222
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,384
She cried often. I asked her why...

223
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,222
but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

224
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,853
Yes, it was quite sad.

225
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,194
Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
are expensive. Extremely expensive.

226
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,864
And this one wasn't making me any money.

227
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,915
I hate bad investments. Really, I... I do.

228
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,834
They haunt me.

229
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,216
And I had no idea how to make her happy.

230
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,928
And no idea how to mitigate my losses.

231
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,810
A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money to let him

232
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,314
transform this lovely sad girl

233
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:24,611
to use her in ways
that would never occur to most men.

234
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,157
And you know what occurs to most men.

235
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,123
I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy...

236
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,795
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

237
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,931
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.

238
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,936
I'll see you tomorrow.
And you'll be happy?

239
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,608
That makes me happy.

240
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,581
More wine?

241
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,209
-Damn it, boy!
-Apologies, my lord.

242
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,379
Leave us Podrick. I believe
we know how to pour our own wine.

243
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,301
That your new squire?
I could have found you a proper lad.

244
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,220
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

245
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,058
-That's a good red. Dornish?
-You know your wines, my lord.

246
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,059
That I do.

247
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,397
-A fine dinner, my lord.
-Call me Tyrion, please.

248
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,276
I'm sure you're getting used
to fine dinners now that you're a lord.

249
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,488
-Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
-Wars have been started for less.

250
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,911
I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

251
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,830
Nasty business. Had to be done.

252
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes, of course.
The City Watch must keep the peace.

253
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,213
Only, I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.

254
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,299
-Orders are orders.
-Quite right.

255
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,468
Especially the queen's orders.

256
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,511
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

257
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,599
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

258
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,519
-She's always been a jealous woman.
-You know your sister better than I do.

259
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,022
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.

260
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,565
I don't listen to filth.

261
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,235
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

262
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,155
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

263
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,699
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

264
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,826
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

265
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,495
I appreciate your loyalty.

266
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,126
Tell me, when your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,

267
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,003
did you give the order?

268
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,216
I did. And I would again.

269
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,762
The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.

270
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:00,016
A fool. He had no idea
you were already bought.

271
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,851
Are you drunk?

272
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,938
I will not have my honor
questioned by an imp!

273
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,066
I'm not questioning your honor,
Lord Janos.

274
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,694
I'm denying its existence.

275
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,780
Do you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf?

276
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,491
Dwarf? You should've stopped at imp.

277
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,286
And yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

278
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,204
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

279
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,042
I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war.

280
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,378
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

281
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,298
well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.

282
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,884
What are you ta--
My friends at court will not allow this.

283
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,345
-The queen herself granted--
-The queen regent.

284
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,681
And you're a fool
to believe she's your friend.

285
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,058
We shall hear
what Joffrey has to say about this.

286
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,143
No, we shan't.

287
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,903
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch by the sea tonight.

288
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,365
From there, I'm afraid
it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.

289
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:02,245
I hope you enjoy the Wall.
I found it surprisingly beautiful,

290
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:06,374
in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.

291
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,045
The lads will escort you.
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

292
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:14,924
These men are under my command!
I command you to arrest this cut-throat.

293
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,092
His name is Bronn.

294
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,720
And he is the new commander
of the City Watch.

295
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,139
Boys.

296
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,644
I have friends at court! Powerful friends!

297
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,939
The king himself made me a lord!

298
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,488
To the new commander.

299
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,205
If I told you to murder

300
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,459
an infant girl, say,
still at her mother's breast,

301
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,004
would you do it without question?

302
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,260
Without question, no. I'd ask how much.

303
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,572
If they come back, I say we yield.

304
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,533
Gendry's the one they want.

305
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

306
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,120
I ain't afraid of no battles.

307
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,997
If you got within a mile of a battle
you'd fill your pants.

308
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,750
-I've seen lots of battles. I saw--
-Liar.

309
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:35,547
I saw a man kill another man
just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

310
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:40,218
-Stabbed him right in the neck.
-Two men fighting isn't a battle.

311
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,680
-They had armor on.
-So?

312
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,434
-So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
-No, it isn't.

313
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,687
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

314
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,439
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

315
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,400
Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes
a fight into a battle.

316
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,739
-It's when they've got armor on.
-And who told you that?

317
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,619
-A knight.
-How'd you know he was a knight?

318
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
Well, because he's got ar... armor on.

319
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,753
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor.

320
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,965
-How do you know?
-Because I sold armor.

321
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,147
What do the Gold Cloaks want with you?

322
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,066
-No idea.
-You're a liar.

323
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,277
You know, you shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.

324
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,279
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

325
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,615
Well, I don't care what any of them want.

326
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,744
-No good's ever come of their questions.
-No good's ever come.

327
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,205
Who asked questions before?

328
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,583
How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?

329
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:54,959
Who asked questions?

330
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,965
The Hand of the King. Hands of the King.

331
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,178
Lord Arryn came first,
a few weeks before he died

332
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,556
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

333
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,433
Lord Stark.

334
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,812
See, asking me questions is bad luck.

335
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,066
You'll probably be dead soon.

336
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,111
-What did they ask about?
-My mom.

337
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,406
-Who's your mom?
-She was just my mom.

338
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,117
Worked in a tavern.
Died when I was little.

339
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,244
And who was your father?

340
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,288
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards for all I know.

341
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,417
What about you anyway?
You thought they were after you.

342
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,048
Why? Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?

343
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,260
-I'm not a girl.
-Yes, you are.

344
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,762
You think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

345
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,640
Stupider. The Night's Watch
doesn't take girls. Everyone knows that.

346
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,183
Yeah, that’s true.
But you're still a girl.

347
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,268
I am not!

348
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,978
Yeah, well, pull your cock out
and take a piss then.

349
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,106
I don't need to take a piss.

350
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,116
Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.
No one can know.

351
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,952
Well, they won't. Not from me.

352
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,961
My name's not Arry.
It's Arya. Of House Stark.

353
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

354
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,803
Who's your father?
The Hand, the traitor?

355
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:32,056
He was never a traitor. Joffrey is a liar.

356
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,351
So, you're a highborn then. You're a lady.

357
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,061
No. I mean, yes.

358
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,439
My mother was a lady
and my sister, but--

359
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,608
You were a Lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle,

360
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,861
but all that about cocks
I should never have said.

361
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,697
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

362
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,366
I should be calling you "my lady."

363
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,869
-Do not call me "my lady."
-As my lady commands.

364
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,371
Well, that was unladylike.

365
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,818
What you carrying?

366
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,782
Various oranges. Wine from the Arbor.

367
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,535
And the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.

368
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,917
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

369
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,172
Me.

370
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,260
I don't like wine. Woman's drink.

371
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,265
I need to get to Pyke.

372
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,860
I'll find you a horse.

373
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,041
I'm heading that way.
I can take you there.

374
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,627
I bet you can.

375
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:29,465
You been at sea long? Or were there
just no women where you came from?

376
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,051
-None like you.
-You don't know what I'm like.

377
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,305
Maybe you don't know what you're like.
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

378
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,350
Do you know who I am?

379
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,812
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry...

380
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,356
Lord Greyjoy?

381
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,236
Have my things sent up to the castle.

382
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,174
You should give me the reins.
I'm a better rider than you.

383
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,342
Been on horseback
for the past nine years.

384
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,013
Nine years. Do you still know
your way around a ship?

385
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

386
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,684
Don't you worry about my hands.

387
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,730
The sea is in my blood.

388
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,150
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

389
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,736
I have a proposal for my father.

390
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,783
One that will make him king again.
And me after him.

391
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,038
You may get to stay in a castle tonight,
if you're lucky.

392
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,501
-Is that an offer from my future king?
-An order from your future king.

393
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,339
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

394
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,592
I don't imagine it'll be a story
fit for children.

395
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,398
Father.

396
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,318
Nine years, is it?

397
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,824
They took a frightened boy.
What have they given back?

398
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,121
-A man. Your blood and your heir.
-We shall see.

399
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,962
-Stark had you longer than I did.
-Lord Stark is gone.

400
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,800
And how do you feel about that?

401
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,721
What's done is done.

402
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,100
I've brought you a proposal
from Robb Stark.

403
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,768
Who gave you those clothes?

404
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,273
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

405
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,693
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

406
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,694
You will.

407
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,992
That bauble around your neck,
did you pay the iron price for it,

408
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,495
or the gold? I asked a question.

409
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,748
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made,

410
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,627
or did you buy it to match
your fine clothes?

411
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,007
Iron or gold?

412
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,386
Gold.

413
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,810
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

414
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,985
My fears have come true.
The Starks have made you theirs.

415
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,737
My blood is salt and iron.

416
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,365
Yet the Stark boy sends you to me
like a trained raven,

417
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,742
clutching his message.

418
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,203
-The offer he makes is one I proposed.
-He heeds your counsel.

419
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,998
I've lived with him, hunted with him,
fought at his side.

420
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:53,461
-He thinks of me as a brother.
-No! Not here. Not in my hearing.

421
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,755
You will not name him brother.

422
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,842
This son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword,

423
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,720
or have you forgotten your own blood?

424
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,973
I forget nothing. I remember my brothers.

425
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,810
And I remember when my father was a king.

426
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:31,123
I see. I destroy
Robb Stark's enemies for him

427
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,502
and he will make me
King of the Iron Islands once again.

428
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,213
-I will lead the attack myself.
-You will?

429
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,968
I'm your son.
Your only living heir. Who else?

430
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,390
I told you to wait outside.

431
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,937
-How did you get past the guards?
-Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

432
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,356
My dear.

433
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,947
-Yara?
-So good to see you, brother.

434
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,993
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

435
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,665
-She can't lead an attack!
-And why not?

436
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,293
-You're a woman!
-You're the one in skirts.

437
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,920
This isn't Winterfell, boy.

438
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,132
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

439
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,426
after your new father killed him.

440
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,470
-What's dead may never die.
-What's dead may never die.

441
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,849
The only night she's spent
off these islands

442
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:34,061
have been spent on the sea.
She's commanded men.

443
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,149
She's killed men.
And she knows who she is.

444
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,529
No man gives me a crown.

445
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:49,118
I pay the iron price.
I will take my crown.

446
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:54,915
For that is who I am.
That is who we have always been.

447
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,131
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

448
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,091
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

449
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,478
You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.

450
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,230
All these kings fighting
for the throne and this Stannis

451
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,648
has the smallest army.

452
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,026
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

453
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,403
Because you're a smart gambler.

454
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,782
Stannis has proved himself in war, twice.

455
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,327
His baby brother
has never set foot on a battlefield.

456
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,581
-Neither has the false King Joffrey.
-And yet, they both have larger armies.

457
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:39,919
Well, Stannis has just begun the fight.
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

458
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,508
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon

459
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
or more worthy of loyalty.

460
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:51,305
What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings?

461
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,973
-You mind your words, pirate.
-Matthos.

462
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,393
Do you think I'm insulted? I am a pirate.

463
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,106
I'm an excellent pirate.
I don't sail for promises.

464
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,440
Of course you do.

465
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,443
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.

466
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,822
A promise that somewhere on the seas
somebody's got some gold

467
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,073
and you can take it from them.

468
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,449
That's a promise that always comes true.

469
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,577
As is mine.
You're not a young man, Salladhor.

470
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:18,082
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but most pirates don't grow old.

471
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,750
Only the clever ones.

472
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,003
You want to spend your last
few years on the sea

473
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,632
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Meereenese silk merchants, then go.

474
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,301
They're out there waiting for you.
That's easy.

475
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,138
What I'm offering you is hard.

476
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,976
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

477
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,688
You'll be the richest man in Lys.
And the most famous.

478
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,525
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

479
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,779
Salladhor Saan is a good name
for songs.

480
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,780
It is.

481
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,449
One thing. I want the queen.

482
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,910
-The queen?
-Cersei. I want her.

483
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,955
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships

484
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,291
and if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

485
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,502
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.

486
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,004
This war isn't about you.

487
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,133
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

488
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

489
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,055
-As if she would just let you.
-You don't know how persuasive I am.

490
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,349
I never tried to fuck you.

491
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,813
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light.

492
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,356
The one true God.

493
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,151
I've been all over the world, my boy,
and everywhere I go,

494
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,779
people tell me about the true Gods.
They all think they found the right one.

495
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,991
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs.

496
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,202
And better yet, a queen's legs.

497
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,372
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

498
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,749
He's young yet.

499
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,295
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

500
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,630
I cannot promise you the queen.

501
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,179
-You believe your king can win?
-He's the one true king.

502
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,389
You Westerosi are a funny people.

503
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,100
Man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

504
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,688
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

505
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:09,443
You're the most honest smuggler
I ever met. Make me rich.

506
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,656
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

507
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,670
When will the king have us sail?

508
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,713
As soon as his God wills it.

509
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,301
He's my God too, and yours.
Or are you too blind to see?

510
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,723
-Let me teach you how to read.
-You and your mother.

511
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,308
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

512
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,686
The holy books are more
persuasive than I can be.

513
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,063
I wish I had a God, truly.
Now, I'm not mocking you,

514
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,357
but I've seen men pray
to every God there is.

515
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,568
Pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home. None of it works.

516
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,903
But you always came home.

517
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,532
-I wasn't praying.
-No. But I was.

518
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,579
Every night that you were at sea,
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

519
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,917
You want me to have a God? Fine.

520
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,672
King Stannis is my God. He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

521
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,550
He gave you a future I could never
have imagined.

522
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,677
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

523
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,683
You think a Fire God commanded
all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.

524
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,813
-Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
-Don't tell him that.

525
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,235
Lord Janos Slynt was the Commander
of the City Watch.

526
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,572
-You had no right to exile him.
-I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

527
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,991
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

528
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,785
-I'm Queen Regent.
-Listen to me, Queen Regent.

529
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,370
You're losing the people.

530
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,250
-Do you hear me?
-The people? You think I care.

531
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,087
You might find it difficult to rule
over millions who want you dead.

532
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,299
Half this city will starve
when winter comes,

533
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,051
the other half will plot to overthrow you.

534
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,013
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry.

535
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,682
The queen slaughters babies.

536
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,937
You don't even have the decency
to deny it.

537
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,492
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

538
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,495
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

539
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,793
Did he tell you?
I imagine that would be even worse.

540
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,422
He did what needed to be done.
You want to be Hand of the King?

541
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,008
You want to rule? This is what ruling is.

542
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,929
Lying on a bed of weeds,
ripping them out by the root one by one

543
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,680
before they strangle you in your sleep.

544
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,058
I'm no king but I think there's
more to ruling than that.

545
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,434
I don't care what you think!

546
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,355
You've never taken it seriously.
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

547
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,735
It's all fallen on me.

548
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,701
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

549
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,875
You're funny.

550
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,297
You've always been funny.

551
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,969
But none of your jokes
will ever match the first one, will they?

552
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:28,517
You remember... back when you
ripped my mother open

553
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,561
on your way out of her
and she bled to death.

554
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,565
She was my mother too.

555
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,525
Mother gone.

556
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,612
For the sake of you.

557
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,410
There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.

558
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,517
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

559
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,729
How did you fare with your pirate?

560
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,942
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.
Thirty ships. His men know how to fight.

561
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,362
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

562
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,617
-It does seem the wiser choice.
-There won't be a choice, this time.

563
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,328
Do you trust him?

564
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,915
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him thirty years.

565
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,167
I've never trusted him.

566
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,420
Now, once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

567
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,299
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

568
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,388
Leave us.

569
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,104
At once, Your Grace.

570
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,781
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

571
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,746
Come.

572
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,713
What did you say to him?

573
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,925
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

574
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,970
-Why?
-Because it is true.

575
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,683
-You're troubled, my king.
-Yeah.

576
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,603
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

577
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,313
Tell your lord to burn them then.

578
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:43,402
I tell him nothing.
I pray for his commands and I obey.

579
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,824
My little brother has 100,000 men
according to the scouts.

580
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,952
Men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

581
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,289
-You must have faith.
-Faith?

582
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,627
In a real war,
the side with the greater number wins.

583
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,962
Nine times out of ten.

584
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,800
-Then we must be the tenth.
-I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

585
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,054
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

586
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,268
I have seen the path to victory
in the flames.

587
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,898
But first you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

588
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,651
I've said the words, damn you!

589
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,740
I burnt the idols.

590
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,955
You must give all of yourself.

591
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,629
I have a wife.

592
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,049
I took a vow.

593
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,135
She's sickly.

594
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,763
Weak.

595
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,932
And shut away in a tower.

596
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,186
She disgusts you.

597
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,152
And she's given you nothing. No sons.

598
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,115
Only stillborns. Only death.

599
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:23,168
I will give you a son, my king.

600
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,047
A son?
