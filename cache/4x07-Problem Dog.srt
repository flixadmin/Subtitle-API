1
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,918
Welcome.

2
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,077
Where is the rest of your party?

3
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,239
I am the only one coming.

4
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,193
And why is that?

5
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,072
My employers feel I can adequately
represent their interests.

6
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,399
Please, sit.

7
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,353
This is my offer.

8
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,231
In consideration
of our previous relationship...

9
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,432
...I will make a one-time payment...

10
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,792
...of 50 million U.S. dollars.

11
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,035
In return our business is concluded.

12
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,436
No further payments.
No further contact.

13
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,353
An absolute severance.

14
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,030
You have no response?

15
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,709
This is my response:

16
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,713
Yes or no?

17
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,189
You know what the Cartel wants.

18
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,070
Anything else would be a waste of time.

19
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,358
Is it to be yes... or no?

20
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,919
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

21
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,635
This is not a negotiation.
