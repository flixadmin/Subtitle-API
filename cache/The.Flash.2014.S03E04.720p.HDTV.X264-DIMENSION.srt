1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,400
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,530
and I'm the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,420
To the outside world,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,280
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,230
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,180
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,880
After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse,

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
I ran back in time and created

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,570
the alternate timeline Flashpoint.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,300
I restored the timeline to how it was,

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,370
only to find things weren't as I left them.

12
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,500
I brought new threats to our world,

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,930
and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,170
I am The Flash.

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,580
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,070
This has been a really amazing date, Flash.

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,200
Cecile, thanks for stopping by.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,020
You restored the timeline, and things were different?

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,060
Exactly.

21
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,170
Jesse, you're a speedster.

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,760
When I came back, things weren't the same.

23
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,990
You mean people.

24
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,210
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,550
How do I look?

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,500
Better.

27
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,510
How much?

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,710
Do we really need to ask that question?

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,510
Our take wasn't that big.

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
Big enough.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,320
But the only question you should be asking is,

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,000
what size rock you want dangling from this beautiful neck?

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,620
A kiss from you makes my world spin.

34
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,220
You're so full of it, you know that?

35
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,620
I got to be honest.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,720
I never understood... this.

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,010
But like my sister says,

38
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,720
anyone can stoop over and pick up nothing.

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,230
What do you want, Snart?

40
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,620
I told you two to sit on your cut for a while,

41
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,440
until things cool down.

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,490
Some of us like to actually spend the cash

43
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,050
we get from these jobs.

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,080
Not when it's from the ones with me.

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,860
You didn't pull 'em off yourself.

46
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,480
Without us, you'd still be kicking down liquor stores.

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,730
I think you've spent too much time

48
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,440
staring at yourself in the mirror,

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,830
because your perception of reality is a bit warped.

50
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,370
You know the rules.

51
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,150
I don't give a damn about your rules,

52
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,710
or laying low.

53
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,930
There's no one in this city who can stop us.

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,700
Including you, Snart.

55
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,280
It sounds to me like you're saying you want out.

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,930
Guess so.

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,570
Well, if you're out...

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
you're out.

59
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,610
No!

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,770
You lost, Scudder.

61
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,880
Sam!

62
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,020
Go.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,510
Go!

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,600
Sam?

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,260
Give me a hand here.

66
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,860
Demo starts in a month. Get everything out of here.

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,830
The hell?

68
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,140
Where's Snart?

69
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,850
Where's Snart?

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,460
This is from a security camera inside Iron Heights.

71
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,540
Forensic analysis indicates that the footage is genuine,

72
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,120
no evidence of tampering.

73
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,880
And we're pretty sure this is Doctor Alchemy that did this?

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,850
The last thing Clariss said before he died.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Unless someone else killed him.

76
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,480
Like a meta with telekinesis or cloaking abilities.

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,930
We've got both on our Earth.

78
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,870
So what do we do now?

79
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,980
Our meta-human specialist at CCPD,

80
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,880
Julian Albert, he prefers to work alone,

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,970
but I got feelers out on his investigation.

82
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,260
I'm gonna go there now and see if he dug up anything.

83
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,190
All right.

84
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,130
Okay, well, until then, you guys want to train?

85
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,550
Well, now, we have to think about getting back to our Earth.

86
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,790
We've been here long enough.

87
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,010
I've still got a lot to learn.

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,640
Your words, not mine.

89
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,510
I...

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,880
fine.

91
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,930
Well, if you want to train,

92
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,820
let's train...

93
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,630
speedster style.

94
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,010
Damn, Jesse's almost as fast as Barry.

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,780
Velocity's just under Mach 3.

96
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,180
Heart rate, 100 BPMs. Her vitals are normal.

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,410
Yeah, no, we already know all that.

98
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,100
Cisco, we need to test her reflexes.

99
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,740
Can we test her reflexes?

100
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,370
Patience, Harry, patience.

101
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,680
If anyone's gonna teach Jesse the ways of the Speed Force--

102
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,140
- It's Barry. - Thank you.

103
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,510
Okay. Well, that wasn't very heroic.

104
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,520
Nope.

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,510
But there is a lesson in there somewhere.

106
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,400
What's that?

107
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,400
The difference between having powers and having precision.

108
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,630
Well, what do you mean?

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,260
I mean, it's gonna take more than speed

110
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,590
to take down some of these metas.

111
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,390
You got to think, anticipate.

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,580
When you enter a new environment,

113
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,750
you got to case every inch of it.

114
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,010
You never run in blind.

115
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh, my God.

116
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,250
I've become Oliver.

117
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,710
Maybe we should stay a little bit longer.

118
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah, I guess so.

119
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,710
It's gonna take some time to master your powers, Jesse.

120
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,940
- You'll get the hang of it. - Yeah, I know, thanks.

121
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,860
Well, since I will be here for a while,

122
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,090
do you want to get out of here?

123
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,180
- Where to? - Does it matter?

124
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,350
No touching.

125
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,610
Not what I meant by staying longer!

126
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,140
I should probably get back to CCPN.

127
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,790
- All right. - I'll see you tonight?

128
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,300
- Can't wait. - Okay.

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,040
- Hey, Harry. - Yeah?

130
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,930
Are you really sure you have to leave?

131
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,990
Just a lot I still have to fix on my Earth.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,190
Yeah, but you know it's more fun

133
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,440
when you're here helping us fix stuff on our Earth.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,690
He is right.

135
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,150
It hasn't been the same without you.

136
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,580
The team doesn't feel complete without Harrison Wells.

137
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,080
Then change that.

138
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,420
There's a whole multiverse of Harrison Wells

139
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,130
out there at your fingertips.

140
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,310
You want one? Let's go get one.

141
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,230
Yeah, now I remembered it.

142
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,910
Thank you, Officer Mayer.

143
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,460
So sorry. I got held up at the courthouse.

144
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,370
No problem.

145
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,790
You're the one doing me the favor.

146
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,790
Yeah, I wouldn't thank me just yet.

147
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,130
Oh, you couldn't find anything.

148
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,560
Nope, no one at the DA's office

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,870
knows anything about anybody named Alchemy.

150
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,010
Oh, damn.

151
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,160
This is, um...

152
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,800
Meta-human related, I assume?

153
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,760
- It appears to be. - Yikes.

154
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,200
- I know. - Okay.

155
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,460
You let me know if there's anything I can do for you, yeah?

156
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,120
Yeah, thanks for bringing it yourself, Cecile.

157
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,570
It was my pleasure.

158
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,970
This is really nice.

159
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,330
Staying in is so much better than going out.

160
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,040
- When you have jobs like ours? Yes. - Yes.

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,500
What?

162
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,660
You're just really handsome.

163
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,420
You are not so bad yourself.

164
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,300
I thought...

165
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,610
I didn't think you were gonna be home for a while, right?

166
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,010
My plans changed.

167
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,930
Unfortunately. I'm just gonna go upstairs.

168
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,860
You can have a beer, sit with us.

169
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,950
Have a good night.

170
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,310
I-I know.

171
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,350
I'm... I'm sorry.

172
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,790
I-I... should we rain check, or...

173
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,290
Barry, I am not upset because our date got interrupted.

174
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,110
- That, I understand. - What do you mean?

175
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,650
You, speeding away when my dad walks in.

176
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,340
- Yeah. - Because, what, we're kissing?

177
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,010
Yeah, Iris, exactly.

178
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,430
What, you don't want to kiss me?

179
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,110
Of course I want to kiss you.

180
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,630
But not in front of him.

181
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,770
What does that matter?

182
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,570
He's your... he's our...

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,260
Joe.

184
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,490
Joe. I don't know.

185
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,270
- Barry, we are adults. - I know.

186
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,420
- We are dating. - Yeah.

187
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,130
We should be able to kiss.

188
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,970
I agree.

189
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,550
Okay, yep.

190
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,190
Yep. You should talk to him.

191
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,830
I... about?

192
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,080
- For real? - Yeah.

193
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,380
Go talk to him.

194
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,240
- Yeah, sure, I'll talk to him. - Okay.

195
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,690
- About us kissing. - Yeah.

196
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,210
It's not gonna be awkward at all.

197
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,470
Let me know how it goes.

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,420
It's gonna be awkward, that's how.

199
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,680
Where's Snart?

200
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,060
Who said that?

201
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,590
Where are you?

202
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,500
Boo.

203
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,390
Scudder?

204
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,770
Where's Snart?

205
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,690
I don't know, man.

206
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,150
Then I guess I'll just have to find someone who does.

207
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,500
And I know just the girl.

208
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,310
Yeah, Sam Scudder. He threw me into a mirror.

209
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,030
I fell out of a second-story window.

210
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,370
So Scudder's going after everyone in Snart's old crew

211
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,530
to track him down?

212
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,550
Yeah, but the only problem is,

213
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,750
Scudder's not gonna find him.

214
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,800
Snart's gone.

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,370
What do you mean, he's gone?

216
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,340
He's gone. I thought I--

217
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,090
Oliver told me that Snart left

218
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,450
with some friends of ours on a...trip.

219
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,670
I don't even want to know.

220
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,060
One of Snart's old crew is at Iron Heights.

221
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,350
I'll go see if I can talk to her.

222
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,790
Okay, I'll see if I can locate

223
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,120
any others at S.T.A.R. Labs.

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,270
Actually... I'm sorry, I just--

225
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,190
I need to talk to you about something really quick.

226
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,100
Okay, so I-I know

227
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,770
it's probably awkward

228
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,030
seeing me and Iris kiss.

229
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,310
- Uh, yeah. - Yeah.

230
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,190
So I-I was just thinking, maybe...

231
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,290
did it have to be awkward?

232
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,930
Do you mean like this conversation?

233
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,190
Yeah, like this conversation.

234
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,460
I don't know, just 'cause the next time, um, you see us,

235
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,960
we may kiss again in front of you.

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,890
Okay.

237
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,410
So I just want to make sure

238
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,180
that that is...okay with you.

239
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,160
Look, Bar.

240
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,710
- You're an adult. - Yes.

241
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,530
Do what you got to do.

242
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
- I love you. - I love you too.

243
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,770
I love her.

244
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,990
I don't love watching you two make out.

245
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,860
Okay, and just-just so you know,

246
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,740
I am gonna tell Iris that-that we talked about this.

247
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,670
Yeah, like I said. Do what you got to do.

248
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,020
Okay.

249
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,920
How sure are you that this will work?

250
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,430
Pretty sure.

251
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,270
Okay, but how's this going to help us

252
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,120
find another Harrison Wells?

253
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
You ever go fishing, Snow?

254
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,370
- No. - No, all right.

255
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,720
When you go fishing, you use lures.

256
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Lures attract fish.

257
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,030
Fish end up on your fishing pole.

258
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,750
This satellite is our fishing pole,

259
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,850
through which we're going to cast our very tempting bait

260
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,090
out into the world's largest ocean.

261
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,040
Okay, how?

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,940
How? Cisco will open a breach,

263
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,350
and this satellite will shootho message embedded

264
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,040
with a tachyon-enhanced laser out into the multiverse,

265
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,380
and any Earth that is technologically advanced enough

266
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,880
should be able to receive it.

267
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,020
Okay, let's say this somehow works.

268
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,880
Just 'cause they can solve a riddle

269
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,380
doesn't mean they're a right fit for the team.

270
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,130
A riddle. Did you say riddle?

271
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,520
- Yeah. - How dare you, sir.

272
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,020
This is not a riddle.

273
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,840
This is a complex algorithmic cryptogram

274
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,530
designed to test deductive reasoning,

275
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,880
IQ, problem-solving skills,

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,260
anything that our team will need to combat threats,

277
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,820
meta-human or otherwise.

278
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,540
Okay, so you're just sending out an intergalactic IQ test

279
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,290
to all of your doppelgangers in the multiverse.

280
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,490
Not just a test. Think of it as an invitation.

281
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,550
Think of it as an elaborate "Help wanted" ad.

282
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,350
Will it test their attitudes, too?

283
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,850
'Cause I'm not sure I can stomach another Wells

284
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,120
with your bedside manner.

285
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,510
I care for you too, you jack wagon.

286
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,830
System is calibrated.

287
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,720
What are you waiting for?

288
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,420
And...

289
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,500
That's it.

290
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,190
- That's it? - Yeah, that's it.

291
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,390
So now what?

292
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,280
Now...

293
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,710
we go get a Big Belly burger.

294
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,220
- That's insane. What a rush. - I know.

295
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,460
I mean, it took me a while to get used to it.

296
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,700
I can't believe you're not sick at all.

297
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,460
I must have an iron stomach.

298
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,960
Okay, so you're telling me

299
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,250
that Barry has never taken you on a run?

300
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,180
No.

301
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,090
Well, then, I guess it's a good thing you've got me.

302
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,300
Guess so.

303
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,620
Hold up.

304
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,820
I'm sorry. Am I--am I reading this,

305
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,140
like, really wrong or something?

306
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,130
No, no.

307
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,210
I like you, Jesse. It's just...

308
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,930
It's just what?

309
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,070
You're going home soon.

310
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,910
To another Earth.

311
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,020
Ah, right. Yeah.

312
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,630
Yeah, no, it's-it's cool, yeah.

313
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,790
- Jesse, I... - No, no, no.

314
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,450
It's--it's totally cool.

315
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,380
I get it.

316
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,310
So...so friends, then?

317
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,450
Friends.

318
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,240
Well, as friends, I mean,

319
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,490
we can still run around the city, right?

320
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Sure.

321
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,930
Good-looking guy.

322
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,120
For a criminal.

323
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,090
Well, he's more than just a criminal now.

324
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,550
Apparently, he's a meta who can travel through mirrors.

325
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,510
I got this one. He's, uh...

326
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,680
- Mirror Master. - What the--

327
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
- Boom. - That's good.

328
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,700
Thank you, we had a Mirror Master on our Earth,

329
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,410
Evan McCulloch. Wasn't a meta, though.

330
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,450
He had some kind of mirror gun that he used.

331
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,090
How'd it work?

332
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,710
Must've had dimensional warping tech

333
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,970
that changed everything into two dimensions.

334
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,170
Well, Scudder is hell-bent on finding Snart,

335
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,450
and he's going after anybody that worked with him in the past.

336
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,990
Joe's interviewing one of 'em right now.

337
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,660
Well, all of Snart's known associates

338
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,630
are either presumed dead or gone AWOL,

339
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,370
except for one.

340
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,870
- That's her. - Rosalind Dillon.

341
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,250
Says she has the ability to induce crippling vertigo.

342
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,990
- She's, uh-- - Top, like a top. She's the Top.

343
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,770
That's her name. Top. Amazing.

344
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,970
What, you want to go?

345
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,520
Okay.

346
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,040
Do we think that she can lead us to Scudder?

347
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,380
I'll have to see if Joe gets any answers out of her.

348
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,340
Heard your ex is back in town.

349
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,110
You know anything about that?

350
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,880
He pay you a visit, Ms. Dillon?

351
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,770
They don't let people like me have visitors here, Detective.

352
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,250
All day, all night, in my boring little cell.

353
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,530
Makes a girl go crazy.

354
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,930
Scudder tried to kill one of your old crewmates last night.

355
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,120
- Leon Williams? - Tried? Too bad he failed.

356
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,510
He's gonna try to kill more.

357
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,910
- Any idea who? - Give us a name.

358
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,640
I'll see what we can do about your current situation.

359
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,370
Okay.

360
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,980
Let us know if you change your mind.

361
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,310
- Sorry, Joe. - It's all right.

362
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,510
I appreciate your setting up the interview, though.

363
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,890
It looks like I owe you another one.

364
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,140
You know, these IOUs are starting to pile up.

365
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,240
I have an idea about that.

366
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
Do you?

367
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,070
- Scudder? - You want me?

368
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,260
Come and get me.

369
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,120
So you saw Sam Scudder and Rosalind Dillon

370
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,160
escape through a glass window?

371
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,060
Like I said, he grabbed her hand.

372
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,040
They walked to the window, and then poof, they were gone.

373
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,080
So, mirrors, windows.

374
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,410
It sounds like he can travel through anything

375
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,810
that has a reflective surface.

376
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,290
How exactly does he do that?

377
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,350
He must be able to link Einstein-Rosen bridges

378
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,420
to anything with high solar reflectance, right?

379
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,130
So he creates wormholes through reflections.

380
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,800
That's a new one.

381
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Look, I can't pretend to understand or care

382
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,340
about the science of it all, but we need to find Dillon

383
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,070
and Scudder before something really bad happens.

384
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,060
So I'm gonna go old-school at the precinct.

385
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,190
I'll see you later.

386
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,510
Oh, my God.

387
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,700
Pings. We got pings.

388
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,230
Looks like some of your doppelgangers out there

389
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,880
actually cracked your code, Harry.

390
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,930
That was fast.

391
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,080
Let's go take a look.

392
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,470
Guys? We're...

393
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,210
Dad seems fine.

394
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,660
Yeah, no, he's still a little weird about it.

395
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,270
You talked to him, though, right?

396
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah, I did.

397
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,830
Yeah, it'll be good.

398
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,480
Okay, great.

399
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,050
- Then I'll see you tonight. - All right.

400
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
You'll pick a good movie?

401
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,900
- I'll try. - Okay.

402
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,370
I'm also gonna try to find our meta-humans

403
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,840
that apparently no one else cares about right now.

404
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,520
Where the hell did you go?

405
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,190
How many times do I have to tell you, Rosa?

406
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,160
I was stuck in there.

407
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,970
Whatever it was that hit me gave me this crazy ability.

408
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,960
And to me, all this just happened last night.

409
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,620
It's been three years, Sam.

410
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,000
So many things are different now.

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,540
You were hit too, weren't you?

412
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,590
You can do things like me?

413
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,630
- Yeah. - Show me.

414
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,890
You might want to hold onto something.

415
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,290
See, Sammy?

416
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,080
Too much has changed.

417
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,620
Then let's change it back.

418
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,980
I can stop Snart, Rosa.

419
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,710
We...can stop Snart.

420
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,330
Snart? He's gone.

421
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,300
Long gone.

422
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,260
Then let's take this city.

423
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,420
We can be who we want to now.

424
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,950
We can be in control.

425
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,890
There's no one in this city who can stop us now.

426
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,200
There's one person who can.

427
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,650
Who?

428
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,180
The Flash.

429
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
Well, hey, now.

430
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,100
I-I solved the derivative you done beamed up.

431
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,960
My name is Wells, Harrison Wells.

432
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,220
You can call me Hell's Wells.

433
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,930
They call me that 'cause of my past.

434
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,280
I won't get into it with you now right and proper.

435
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,710
I'd like to hitch wagons and--

436
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,180
I had a bad dinner.

437
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,590
- Pass. - All right.

438
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,700
This is Earth-17.

439
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,870
I'll be in touch.

440
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,000
Salutations to all of you out there in the multiverse.

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,830
I have of late, wherefore I know not, received a communiqu¨¦

442
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,240
from the citizens of Terra-Prime.

443
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,310
Terra-Prime?

444
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,700
- Nerd. - Pass.

445
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,000
Bonjour. Moi, je suis Harrison Wells.

446
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,900
You can't trust a mime.

447
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,170
- Can't argue with that. - Pass.

448
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,510
Okay, guys. We're 0 for 3 now.

449
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,670
This is our last one.

450
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,560
It's coming from Earth-19.

451
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,180
Hello, hello, hello.

452
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,390
Hello, out there in the multiverse,

453
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,540
whoever you may be.

454
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,580
I really enjoyed cracking the cryptogram you broadcast.

455
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,970
I like the cute trick,

456
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,180
embedding the secondary measures

457
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,750
in the primary data string. It's clever.

458
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,350
Most people wouldn't have caught it.

459
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,050
I caught it. But that's the point.

460
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,880
You need a genius, I guess,

461
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,390
to help you in your fight

462
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,860
against these awful meta-hominids.

463
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,400
Well, I got to tell you-- I got to tell you, to me,

464
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,730
that sounds like fun.

465
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,440
So...I'll enclose my curriculum vitae.

466
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,900
You already know we speak the same language.

467
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,170
But take a look. Tell me what you think.

468
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,700
Until our next communion.

469
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,830
Oh, where are my manners?

470
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,950
Thank you.

471
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,710
- Not bad. - Not bad at all.

472
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,390
Harry?

473
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,060
- Pass. - What?

474
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,380
- Pass. - Wait, what? Wait a minute.

475
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,620
That guy cracked the code, and he wants to do it.

476
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,640
And he's nice, and he's not evil.

477
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,520
And that's a combination of Wells we haven't had thus far.

478
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,460
All my life, everyone I've ever hired to work for me,

479
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,430
I have trusted my gut.

480
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,910
My gut tells me that's not the guy.

481
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,990
Keep looking.

482
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,100
Oh, for God's sake.

483
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,560
Okay, you know what?

484
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,930
I can't take this anymore.

485
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,970
What?

486
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,860
I thought you guys were supposed to talk about us.

487
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,100
We did.

488
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,090
Then why are you being so weird?

489
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,610
I'm not.

490
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Dad?

491
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,210
Iris.

492
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,360
I already told him, if you two want to cuddle,

493
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,740
make out, do whatever,

494
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,500
I-I-I...go for it.

495
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,640
I don't care.

496
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,600
Barry?

497
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,890
Should we give you guys a minute?

498
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,120
- Yeah. - No, no, it's fine.

499
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,620
Look, Barry, this isn't about my dad anymore.

500
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,790
He's fine with it.

501
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,230
I'm not totally fine with it.

502
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,780
So why do you have a problem with this?

503
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,300
Thank God.

504
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,210
There's a robbery at First National.

505
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,980
- Suspects match Scudder and Dillon's description.- Scudder and Dillon

506
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,680
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I got to go. - Okay.

507
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,500
Hey...let me help.

508
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,120
We've been training for a reason, right?

509
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,620
- I've got to try. - Yeah, all right, cool.

510
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,350
- Just follow my lead. - Okay.

511
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,530
We keep this up,

512
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,050
baby, we'll be set for life.

513
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
Then what are you waiting for?

514
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,670
Let's do it again.

515
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,770
Anything for you, baby.

516
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, so we're not gonna let you leave here with that.

517
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,180
Hey, Flash.

518
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,010
Heard a lot about you.

519
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,410
That's great.

520
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,530
Can't say the same for you, though.

521
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,210
The name's Jesse Quick.

522
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,390
So...I'm sorry, Scudder,

523
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,360
but your little crime spree, it's gonna have to end here.

524
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,620
Oh, I don't think you have much of a say in it.

525
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,670
I'm gonna take whatever I want.

526
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,210
I thought you were looking for Leonard Snart.

527
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,960
Why bother? His reign is over.

528
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,720
There's a--a new king in town.

529
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,960
And I'm the queen.

530
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,990
Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

531
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,490
Oh, I would, little girl.

532
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,320
Where'd they go?

533
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,740
There.

534
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,860
Stay here.

535
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm not kidding.

536
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,000
Nice skirt, Top.

537
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,020
Top.

538
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,180
I like it.

539
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,600
Because they spin, spin, spin.

540
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,070
What? What's happening?

541
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,310
I can't get my balance.

542
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,610
I know. It's okay.

543
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,840
You're gonna be okay.

544
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,630
But you won't.

545
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,440
Good luck getting him out.

546
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,880
Barry!

547
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,610
- What happened? - I don't know.

548
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,910
I don't know, okay? I looked at Dillon,

549
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,220
and I lost my balance.

550
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,160
She's a meta-human

551
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,420
who induces vertigo.

552
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,850
She just whammied you.

553
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,200
Yeah, I guess so.

554
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,030
It doesn't really matter, does it?

555
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,750
Because now Barry's trapped in there and it's because of me.

556
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,820
Well, you know, I--

557
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,310
I'll go talk to her.

558
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,750
What is he saying?

559
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,400
Is that some sort of mirror language?

560
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,230
Mirrors show objects in reverse.

561
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,590
Maybe that's what we're hearing here.

562
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,180
Only one way to find out.

563
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,710
What are you looking for, Cisco?

564
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,060
You ever seen "Twin Peaks"?

565
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,730
Of course not. Why do I ask?

566
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,120
This is an old backmasking trick

567
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,340
they used for The Man from Another Place,

568
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,310
where they record his audio backwards

569
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,480
and then play it forwards.

570
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,370
Like the Ozzy Osbourne records.

571
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,140
Sure, let's go with that.

572
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,740
Okay, Barry, say something.

573
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,980
Say it again.

574
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,550
Get me out of here.

575
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,340
Now we can understand you.

576
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,680
How do we get him out of there?

577
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,220
Barry, have you tried to phase out yet?

578
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,620
Yes. It's not working.

579
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,330
If Scudder used this mirror as a wormhole,

580
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,810
then these molecules are in a hyper state of flux, so all--

581
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,760
We need is something really cold to slow them down.

582
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,940
I can help with that. Let's go.

583
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,050
Keep him company.

584
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,190
Aren't you gonna need that?

585
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,760
What's the point?

586
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,550
You know, I thought I was ready, but clearly I'm not.

587
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,590
Jesse, you can't blame yourself for this.

588
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,650
- What happened to Barry-- - It was totally my fault.

589
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,370
I mean, he told me to stay back, but I didn't listen, you know?

590
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,280
I just ran in blind, and,

591
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,500
now he's stuck, so--

592
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,330
Look, you made a mistake. So what?

593
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,220
I mean, I'm sure Barry made a lot of mistakes at first too.

594
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,350
Don't let this destroy your confidence.

595
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,570
You're meant to do this, Jesse.

596
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,640
You're meant to be a speedster.

597
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,720
That's why you have these powers and I don't.

598
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,230
You're just trying to cheer me up.

599
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,430
I know you said you don't want to hang, so--

600
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,670
No, I said I didn't want to hang out because I was scared.

601
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,560
Because you live on another Earth, but

602
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,020
I realized I don't want to be scared of that anymore.

603
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,300
I don't think it's gonna work.

604
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,280
What do you mean, you don't think it's gonna work?

605
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,790
I built this to go to absolute zero.

606
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,200
I realize that. But we need the mirror

607
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,010
to maintain zero-point energy long enough

608
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,120
for Barry's molecules to pass through it.

609
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,850
Absolute zero's more than cold enough to do that.

610
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,800
Normally, but we have to account for the internal energy

611
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,790
of the mirror's molecules, as well.

612
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,270
So while absolute cold might be the lowest possible temperature,

613
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,320
- it's not the-- - It's not the lowest

614
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,500
- enthalpy state possible. - Exactly right.

615
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,300
So what are we gonna do?

616
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,470
I don't know...yet.

617
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Okay, go with me here.

618
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,840
What if we send this to the other Wells

619
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
and see if he can figure something out?

620
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,300
- Yeah. - What? No.

621
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,750
What? Oh, everybody's replaceable now, is that right?

622
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,460
- Is that what this is? - What are you talking about?

623
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,960
What are you talking about? That's what you said.

624
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,130
That's not what I said. I'm saying we need to figure out

625
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,280
a solution to this problem, and time's not on our side right now.

626
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,950
That's not gonna help. You're

627
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,710
not contributing to the problem. You're making things worse.

628
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,750
- You know what I think? - What do you think?

629
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,610
I think you don't like the idea

630
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,420
of someone taking your place here.

631
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,060
What are you talking about?

632
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,560
This is why you don't like the other Wells.

633
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,250
What are you talking about? It was my idea.

634
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,590
But that doesn't mean you have to like it.

635
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,470
It's got nothing to do with liking, okay?

636
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,210
You know what it has to do with?

637
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,980
- A molecular decelerator. - A molecular decelerator.

638
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,020
If we augment the molecular decelerator

639
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,800
on the cryogenic generator of the cold gun--

640
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,700
I can build that. I can build that.

641
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,160
Great.

642
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,570
What are you doing?

643
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,520
Do these pants make my butt look big?

644
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm literally stuck in a mirror.

645
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,880
Sorry, yeah.

646
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,520
What's it like in there?

647
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,850
dark.

648
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,050
Look, Iris, I'm...

649
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,930
I'm sorry that I'm... stuck right now.

650
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,290
Oh, honey, I know that you're stuck.

651
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,040
It's okay, we are gonna get you out of there.

652
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,120
No, I mean--no.

653
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,360
That was misleading.

654
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,710
Not the mirror. I mean, with us.

655
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,440
This thing with Joe, and you were right.

656
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,220
I mean, it's not Joe. It's me. It's my problem.

657
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,610
I've just been feeling nervous

658
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,080
about this new dynamic

659
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,360
between the three of us.

660
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,960
I-I don't know.

661
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,530
I have everything that I have ever wanted right now.

662
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,410
And I've never had that in my life.

663
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,880
In a lot of ways,

664
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,460
it's scarier than having nothing, because...

665
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,530
it's easier to fail than succeed.

666
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,610
And I really want to succeed.

667
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,510
What could you possibly be laughing about right now?

668
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,000
I am so sorry, Barry.

669
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,190
You are really sweet.

670
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,690
But it is weird talking to you

671
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,690
through a mirror and a speaker,

672
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,800
and I really want to kiss you right now.

673
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,480
But can we please talk about this later?

674
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,580
Yeah. We can talk about it later.

675
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Guess it is pretty weird.

676
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,850
It's like I'm here, but I'm not.

677
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,470
What?

678
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,310
I just thought of a way to stop Scudder.

679
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,880
What is that?

680
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,860
This is how we get him out of there.

681
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,000
All right. Let's do it.

682
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,660
Okay.

683
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,800
Try it now.

684
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,660
It's only negative 280 degrees Fahrenheit.

685
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,320
We got to get it colder somehow.

686
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,300
I thought you guys said this thing

687
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,270
could get him out of there.

688
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,480
Okay, this thing

689
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,530
is a highly advanced molecular decelerator

690
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,030
that's being powered by a cryo-engine,

691
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,960
and we just kind of improvised it in the last 30 minutes,

692
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,410
so let's just--just cut us some slack, please?

693
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,870
Just keep trying, Barry.

694
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,540
Meta-human alert.

695
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,830
Oh, for God's sake.

696
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,000
If it's not one thing...

697
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,110
It's the other.

698
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,230
Hold on, Bar.

699
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,340
Guys?

700
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,600
Hello?

701
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,480
Central City Municipal Bank just got robbed.

702
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,760
Let me guess by who.

703
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,320
Guys.

704
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,440
- Barry. - Hey.

705
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,160
- How? - Let's figure it out later.

706
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,230
Right now we need to stop Scudder and Dillon.

707
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,940
Okay, so--so what do we do?

708
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,530
We're gonna use mirrors,

709
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,350
an old trick, and an old friend.

710
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,880
- Yeah? - It's Snart.

711
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,090
I heard you were back in town.

712
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,490
- Snart? - Scudder, Rosa.

713
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,270
Long time.

714
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,860
Not long enough.

715
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,020
Hang back.

716
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,420
This guy owes me.

717
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,840
So you called us.

718
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,010
The hell you want?

719
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,180
Same thing.

720
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,730
You two, gone.

721
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,940
Things have changed.

722
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,610
This is our town now.

723
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,840
- Is that right? - Yeah, it is.

724
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,540
And that little cold gun of yours

725
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,470
isn't gonna save you from me.

726
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,980
We'll see about that, now, won't we?

727
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,910
Bang!

728
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,340
Funny thing about holograms.

729
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,000
They're just pale reflections of the real deal.

730
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,370
Hello again.

731
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,800
Jesse Quick.

732
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,940
Quick to run, quick to fall.

733
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,170
Quick to learn.

734
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,220
Well played, Flash.

735
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,980
- What? - I know, right?

736
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,740
I'm sure you've heard of it, right?

737
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,360
It's an infinite reflective loop

738
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,000
that even you can't escape.

739
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,250
Good luck getting out.

740
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,890
So you're sure he can't

741
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,020
Mirror Master his way out of this cell?

742
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,580
No, it's impossible.

743
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,830
Every inch has been modified

744
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,710
with an anti-reflective material.

745
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,390
Even Scudder's gonna forget what he looks like after a while.

746
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,600
Well, I should go.

747
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,660
Hey. So, thank you for everything.

748
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,780
Oh, no. Thank you.

749
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,760
We got another bad meta right where he belongs.

750
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,290
- Yep, all right. - Hey, Joe.

751
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,870
We have an awful lot of IOUs.

752
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,810
Do you maybe want to grab some dinner tonight?

753
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,870
- Dinner? - Yeah.

754
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,840
Yeah, I-- well, I've got movie night

755
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,330
with my kids tonight.

756
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
Rain check?

757
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,890
Yeah. Of course.

758
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,050
Another time, then.

759
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,500
What was that about?

760
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,380
- Why didn't you just say yes? - I don't know.

761
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,100
You're not the only one that gets nervous around here.

762
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,910
You guys, I've never vibed across 18 dimensions before.

763
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,360
Just a little bit longer.

764
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,650
Greetings, earthlings.

765
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,100
Just kidding. I don't really talk like that.

766
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,640
I've just always wanted to say that.

767
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,020
Earthlings.

768
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,340
Wells with a sense of humor. That's new.

769
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,320
Hey, sharpshooter.

770
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,140
You.

771
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,680
You're... handsome.

772
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,460
I know.

773
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,490
I know.

774
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,350
- Likewise, I'm sure. - Yeah.

775
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,550
Harrison.

776
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
Harrison.

777
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,120
You can call me HR.

778
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,080
HR it is.

779
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,350
This is the team, then. Um...

780
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,470
This is Cisco Ramon. He can do anything.

781
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,510
Okay.

782
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,560
This is Dr. Caitlin Snow.

783
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,500
- She is brilliant. - Hi. - Single.

784
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,730
- Don't--all right, that's my daughter.

785
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,500
You don't have to shake her hand.

786
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,070
That gentleman there is Wally West.

787
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,720
This is Barry Allen, or

788
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,420
as we call him on this Earth...

789
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,490
The Flash.

790
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,760
Welcome to Earth-1.

791
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,160
Thanks. Earth-1, that's weird.

792
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,540
Okay, well, we don't have to stand on ceremony.

793
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,680
We don't have to go through all the tears again, do we, gang? Right?

794
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,990
Well, did I-- did I cry last time you left?

795
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,990
- I was talking about myself. - Oh, gotcha.

796
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,640
Hey, listen.

797
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,780
Don't worry about it, okay?

798
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,910
There's only one Harry.

799
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,960
Oh, I wanted to tell you.

800
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,730
The molecular decelerator, it wasn't working.

801
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,070
Okay, what does that mean?

802
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,950
It means that we did not get Barry out of that mirror.

803
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,110
It wasn't us.

804
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,170
Then who did it?

805
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,760
You tell me.

806
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,430
- See you later. - Yeah.

807
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,450
Earth-2's gonna have one hell of a speedster protecting it.

808
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,170
Well, I did learn from the best.

809
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,180
If you ever need any help, you know how to get back.

810
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,170
Yeah. Yeah, definitely, I'll be back.

811
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,050
All right.

812
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,280
Okay, you guys.

813
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,050
Ready?

814
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,040
Yeah, yeah.

815
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,330
Okay, Cisco.

816
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,060
Out with the old, in with the new.

817
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,410
You'll never be old to us, Harry.

818
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,280
-Ready? - Yeah.

819
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,810
Okay, let's do this.

820
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh, one more thing. While I'm gone, never, ever,

821
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,530
no matter what--

822
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,130
What--what was he gonna say?

823
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,160
And we're all like, "What was he gonna say?"

824
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,020
That's cool, though. I'm starving.

825
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,230
Do you guys have Big Belly Burger?

826
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,660
Some things never change.

827
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,870
Famished.

828
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,600
Did Barry say anything about

829
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,670
this embarrassing moment with Cecile?

830
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,490
How did your first meeting go with the new Wells?

831
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,640
Good. Yeah, I think he'll work out fine.

832
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,160
Oh, good. I look forward to meeting him.

833
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,330
- Whoa. - What?

834
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,010
I'm just kidding.

835
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,680
I got to be honest,

836
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,160
it's gonna take a bit for me to get used to that.

837
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,620
I actually have something to run by you guys that

838
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
- I think might help with that. - Really?

839
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,940
- Yeah. - What up?

840
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,740
Well, I've just been thinking that maybe for all of us--

841
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,620
that I should probably, um...

842
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,240
get my own place.

843
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,260
- Really? - Yeah.

844
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,500
What do you think?

845
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,750
- I say yes. - I thought you'd never leave.

846
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,920
- Seriously? - Dad.

847
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,940
- Wow. - Look, Bar, come on.

848
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,420
I'm gonna miss you, but damn.

849
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,860
You grown. About time.

850
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,390
I can't tell if I'm leaving

851
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,870
or if I'm getting kicked out.

852
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,440
You feel like you feel.

853
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,740
Feel like I'm getting kicked out.

854
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,120
I mean, yeah, I feel like you're getting kicked out too.

855
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,150
Like, it's pretty obvious

856
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,850
you're getting kicked out.

857
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,750
Dad.

858
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,180
You're grown.

859
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,570
Oh, well. Cool.
