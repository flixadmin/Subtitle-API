1
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,602
You remember in the camp--

2
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:34,108
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

3
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,778
and I snuck into the storage
room to steal you rice?

4
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,993
I took care of you.

5
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:50,332
I still will.

6
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,675
I also remember the time they
came after you for stealing.

7
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:04,346
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

8
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,725
You might be my big sister.

9
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,437
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

10
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,940
You know...

11
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,360
the Americans will torture me.

12
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,488
I won't let them.

13
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,116
How will you stop them?

14
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,664
You have to let me go.

15
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,586
I won't attack anyone.

16
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,671
I won't hurt anyone.

17
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,636
I'm your brother--

18
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,848
we only have each other now.

19
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,684
Please.

20
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,868
I'm sorry.

21
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,048
Please.

22
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,090
Don't.

23
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,627
Please.

24
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,464
I love you.

25
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,802
I love you, too.
