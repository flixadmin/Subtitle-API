what it needs, he's all right by me.

he's burning down buildings?

203
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:59,160
Penguin. He tried to kill our next mayor.

204
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,376
THEO: Mr. Cobblepot knew that
I was poised to win the election today,

205
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,920
and he came to me seeking an alliance.

206
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,881
And you refused.

207
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,217
(SCOFFS) I politely declined, yes.

208

So he stabbed you in the neck?

209
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,264
That seems like a pretty extreme reaction,
even for Penguin.

210

We've been trying to build a case
against Penguin since I got here.

211
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,020
We assume that he's behind
the earlier attacks

212
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,688

to put behind bars.

I assume you have something for me.

additional powers.

I have no problem going after Penguin
with everything we've got,

but if we start kicking down the doors
of average citizens

we're no better than he is.
