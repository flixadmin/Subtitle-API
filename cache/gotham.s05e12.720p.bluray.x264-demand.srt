1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,077
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,877
We will create a legacy
in this city.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,350
<i>Gotham falls... we rise.</i>

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,920
Together.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,719
Why don't you understand?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,200
You need me!

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,749
I'm the answer
to your life's question!

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,438
All this happened
because of me,

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,193
<i>because people were trying
to hurt me</i>

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,590
<i>and the people I care about.</i>

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,071
<i>With reunification underway
and the bridges being rebuilt,</i>

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,756
<i>it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon</i>

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,479
<i>the title of commissioner.</i>

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
What do you mean you're leaving?

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,191
- Gotham's in good hands.
- Thank you, Bruce.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,398
That you are the only son
that I will ever have.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,477
<i>And I could not be more proud.</i>

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,036
<i>Alfred...</i>

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,635
<i>I'm writing to let you know
I'm okay...</i>

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,111
<i>and that you won't hear
from me for some time.</i>

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,633
<i>But I will return...</i>

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,554
<i>when I know I'm able to protect
the people I love.</i>

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,472
<i>When Gotham needs me...</i>

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,472
<i>I will return.</i>

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,631
It began a few weeks ago.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,157
Someone attacking
the gangs downtown.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,959
No deaths so far, at least.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,350
Hoods couldn't give
a description, but, uh,

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,672
they did mention a growling.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,955
A growling?

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,838
It's a rumor;
ignore it.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,196
Oswald Cobblepot gets out
of Blackgate tomorrow.

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,192
One theory is he's
sending someone

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,715
to put the fear of God
into the underworld.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
And you choose this moment
to hand in your resignation.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,114
I told you that months ago.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,395
That's not the point.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,915
Look, things are unstable.
I-Isn't there, uh,

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
uh, some break-in

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,995
at a government warehouse that
you guys haven't solved yet?

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,753
Yeah, 'cause the Feds
won't tell us squat.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,230
I'm not looking for excuses!

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,752
Look... you mean
something to this city.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
You can't quit.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,195
Not now.

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,039
Because of Wayne Tower.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,896
Bruce Wayne is returning
home for the first time

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,195
in a decade
for its opening.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,352
The new Wayne Tower
represents hope for Gotham.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,909
So, yeah... I need you.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,436
Mayor James...
I told you I would stay

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,080
until after
the Wayne inaugural.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,271
Then I'm done.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,429
If you'll excuse me,

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,796
I have a fund-raiser
I have to get ready for.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,118
Good day, gentlemen.

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,875
Jim.

58
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,270
I've had ten years, Harv.

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,517
It's time for someone else
to have a chance.

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,115
And you wait for Bruce
to come back to hang it up?

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,032
That's a coincidence?

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,191
I'm late.
I have to meet Barbara.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,396
Yeah.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,354
The queen of Gotham.

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,950
Tell me something.

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,515
Why didn't I buy up half
of Gotham on the cheap

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
after reunification?

68
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,470
Become a tycoon. Hmm?

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,079
Give a kiss to the little one
from Uncle Harv.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,432
Will do.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,679
Hey, slugger.

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,911
Daddy!

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,112
- Just do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,476
Hi, sweetheart.

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,435
So... did you hear
from Bruce?

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,435
No.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,398
Ten years and
not a word.

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,279
But I'm assuming he'll be at the
gala for Wayne Tower tomorrow.

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,716
I want to see the look on
his face when I tell him,

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,190
in three months he won't have
the tallest building

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,794
in Gotham anymore.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,234
Hmm.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Think he'll recognize you

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,677
with that caterpillar
on your top lip?

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,999
Okay, munchkin, I love you.

86
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,072
Don't let her stay up too late.

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,520
Ice cream?

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,398
Yeah.

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,794
Bruce is back.

90
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,194
Big deal.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,357
I knew him.

92
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,239
Back in the day.

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,119
Saved Gotham together.

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,194
Oswald's being freed?

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Hey!

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,278
I've been in
here ten years!

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,113
Ten years!

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,159
I deserve to read the newspaper,
you mouth breather!

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,553
Hey! Hey!

100
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Hey!

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,994
Do you know who that is?

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,400
Jeremiah Valeska.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,193
And yeah...

104
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,670
he's been
a vegetable for a decade.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,154
Can't think. Can't feel.

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,118
But he is

107
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,192
a legend.

108
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,751
And if you're gonna
screw with a legend...

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,395
...do it properly.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,118
This never gets
old.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,557
Hey, buddy,
I got something for you.

112
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,835
Hey!

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,136
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Come on.

115
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,111
Out of the way.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,073
Whoa.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,152
Yup. It was time
to admit it.

118
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,391
I was trying something.
It didn't work.

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,432
You liked it, right?

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Totally.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,799
At least now Bruce
will recognize you.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,076
Hmm. That's very funny.

123
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,351
I wonder how much
he's changed.

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,875
Well, it's been ten years.
I'd imagine a lot.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,519
Well, we haven't.

126
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,478
I'm still a doctor.
You're still a cop.

127
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,155
Mm. Not for long.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,875
Are you having second thoughts
about leaving?

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,234
Well...

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,391
I'm all for it.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,358
But I know how much
this job means to you.

132
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,550
And how much the city
looks to you. It always has.

133
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,597
Well, that's just it.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,914
I was hoping
Gotham would outgrow me.

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,997
But it hasn't
exactly happened.

136
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,992
No one's stepped forward.

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,277
Well, maybe you need
to step down

138
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,636
to allow someone to step up.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,479
Jim Gordon.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,593
Clean-shaven man of leisure.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,433
Ten years.

142
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,429
I wonder what Bruce
will think of Selina.

143
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,672
<i>She's become quite the it girl
around town.</i>

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,434
So they have no idea
when Nygma actually escaped?

145
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,233
He wasn't in his
cell this morning.

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,549
This is where
the guard lives.

147
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,791
The one that didn't
show for work.

148
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,758
All right. I got it.

149
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,672
Stay here in case
something else comes in.

150
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,955
All right.

151
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,637
GCPD.

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,394
No! Okay. Okay...

153
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,757
Shut up! Talk to him.

154
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,239
This is
Detective Bullock.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,514
You understand?

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
Oh, my God.

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,151
You understand
what you have to do?

158
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh, my God.

159
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,716
I don't have a choice!

160
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,078
What the hell happened, Harvey?

161
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,831
What did Harper say?

162
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,957
I want to hear it from you.

163
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,029
We, uh, tracked down
this Arkham guard

164
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,840
we thought maybe
helped Nygma escape.

165
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,673
I shot him.

166
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,513
End of story.

167
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,274
You're confessing...

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,875
to killing an unarmed
suspect in cold blood.

169
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,599
That's what happened.

170
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,873
You got to let it go.

171
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,997
Harvey, I don't
know if you think

172
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,754
you're protecting
yourself or someone else,

173
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
but you need
to change your story.

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,118
Otherwise
you're going to Blackgate.

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,113
And you know what happens
to cops in Blackgate.

176
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
That's what happened.

177
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,794
So let it go.

178
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,230
All right, first things first.

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,915
Whoever here doesn't believe
Harvey Bullock is innocent

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,912
can leave right now.

181
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,515
Good.

182
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,032
You think Nygma's behind this?

183
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,431
Maybe. But he's been
inside Arkham for ten years.

184
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,176
It's not like he suddenly
decided to break out.

185
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,510
- He had help.
- Penguin gets released today.

186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,875
You think...?

187
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,077
Yeah. Put a tail on him.

188
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,399
In the meantime, I
want every other cop

189
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,477
in this city
on the hunt for Edward Nygma.

190
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,960
We looked into
the dead guard.

191
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,157
He used to be associated
with a southside gang.

192
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,959
Got an address.
An old warehouse.

193
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,216
All right.
You and I will hit it.

194
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,880
Rest of you have your
orders. Let's go.

195
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,918
Hello?!

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,076
Anybody?!

197
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,872
Anybody!

198
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,319
"Dear Ed, my old friend.

199
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,756
"Half of Gotham
thinks you a madman.

200
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,560
"The other half
has forgotten you.

201
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
It's time to remind them
who the Riddler is."

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,513
"I've given you all you need.
Follow the instructions.

203
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,750
Oswald."

204
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,231
Oswald...

205
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,516
what are you planning?

206
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,791
Mr. Cobblepot, what's the first
thing you'll do as a free man?

207
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,394
I will lay flowers on the grave
of my beloved mother.

208
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,837
And what of Jim Gordon's role
in your incarceration?

209
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,151
Will you seek revenge?

210
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,197
The best revenge
against Jim Gordon

211
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,956
will be a life spent serving
the city I love.

212
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,949
What do you say, young man?

213
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,315
How'd you like
an exclusive?

214
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,516
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,232
Your jacket and hat.

216
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,834
What?

217
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,274
Now!

218
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,952
GCPD!

219
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,238
GCPD.

220
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,038
<i>This is the place.</i>

221
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,276
<i>Good God.</i>

222
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,034
<i>Did your lead say
anything about this?</i>

223
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,715
<i>About a gangland bloodbath?</i>

224
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
<i>No.</i>

225
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,398
What the hell is going on?

226
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,513
<i>Someone's covering their tracks.</i>

227
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
<i>There was a break-in</i>

228
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,392
<i>in a government warehouse
last week.</i>

229
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,833
Those crates have
U.S. Army markings.

230
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,760
Find the back stairs.

231
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,279
GCPD!

232
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,038
I know you're here.

233
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,715
Show yourself.

234
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,438
<i>I am not your enemy.</i>

235
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,176
<i>Don't touch the bodies.</i>

236
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,919
Don't move!

237
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,119
Grenade!

238
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay, thanks.

239
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,794
Bomb squad said the bodies
were rigged with C-4.

240
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,473
Whoever that was
saved our lives.

241
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,639
Suggesting...

242
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,473
that he wasn't the one
that killed them.

243
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,069
Could be he's hunting the
same person we're hunting.

244
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,194
Whoever's really
behind all this.

245
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,920
- You thinking he's on our side?
- Yeah, maybe.

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
That C-4 has to have been

247
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,597
what was stolen
from the government warehouse.

248
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,911
Which means most of it's
still missing.

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,754
Just got a call.
Mayor James vanished,

250
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,479
and our tail lost Penguin.

251
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,634
Sir, what the hell is going on?

252
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,277
First Nygma,
now Penguin.

253
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,793
Keep it simple.

254
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Imagine all that C-4.

255
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,834
What's the biggest target
in Gotham right now?

256
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,389
Double security
for tonight's event.

257
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,951
I have to talk to Bruce Wayne
and Alfred Pennyworth.

258
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,593
Hello, old friend.

259
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,399
- Oswald...
- One more word,

260
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,837
and I will put a bullet in you
here and now.

261
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,320
Drive.

262
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,356
Oswald...

263
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,194
Don't talk!

264
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,476
Turn around!

265
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,078
Remember when
we stood here, Jim,

266
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,311
all those years ago?

267
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,472
Don Falcone wanted you
to shoot me. You refused.

268
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,470
Now don't you wish
you had done it?

269
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,755
Everyone will know you did this.

270
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,839
Let them!

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,040
We both know that this has been
a long time coming.

272
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,552
Our story is...

273
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,950
over, old friend.

274
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,077
You want to
kill me, fine.

275
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,838
But there's no need
to attack the Wayne gala.

276
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,079
What are you talking about?

277
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,356
Breaking Nygma
out of Arkham.

278
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,033
The attacks
on the gangs.

279
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,456
What do you think,
you're gonna be able

280
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,359
to destroy Wayne Tower
and no one's gonna notice?

281
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,040
I don't know
what you're talking about.

282
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,677
You and I stood
shoulder to shoulder

283
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,071
on those barricades,
ready to die for this city.

284
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,509
Six months later,

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,638
you locked me up like an animal!

286
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,715
This begins and ends

287
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,554
with you and me!

288
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,077
You're telling the truth.

289
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,679
Goodbye, Jim.

290
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,513
Turn around!

291
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,430
You know, you made a mistake
bringing me out to this pier.

292
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,352
Don't talk!

293
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,318
Or maybe you
just have a short memory.

Bruce's new Gotham.

297
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,918
I like the old one.

298
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,831
Selina?

299
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,952
How wonderful to see you again.

300
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,151
It's been far,
far too long.

301
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,353
Where is he?

302
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Well, I-I'm afraid travels
abroad haven't increased

303
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,354
Master Bruce's respect
for punctuality, Miss Kyle.

304
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,874
I came here to tell him
to stop spying on me.

305
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,240
I don't understand.

306
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,470
I was out the
other night

307
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,233
and I felt someone watching me.

308
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,834
I know it was Bruce.

309
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Oh, I see,
right, well,

310
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,517
that makes perfect sense.

311
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,115
So you come here tonight dressed
to the nines to tell him

312
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,776
that you want nothing more
to do with him.

313
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,856
Is that the kind of gist of it?

314
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,712
He left, Alfred.

315
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,395
Everything we went through,
and one day he's just gone.

316
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,472
He doesn't get to come back
after ten years

317
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,631
and act like nothing's happened.

318
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,552
On this, we absolutely agree.

319
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,272
I do, however,
feel it might be something

320
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,591
that you want to tell him
yourself.

321
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,880
He needs to stay away.

Well, look at you.

00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,514
I think Bruce is gonna regret
being gone all these years.

327
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,837
Follow me.

Credit to Bruce.

329

He did not skimp
on the caterers.

330
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,833
Hungry?

331
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,400
Uh-uh.

332
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,993
Your loss.

333
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,799
Not long now.

334
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>Bruce Wayne's first public
appearance in nearly a decade.</i>

335
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,319
Lucius.

336
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,959
Lee.

337
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,157
Heard about Harvey...
how is he? How's Jim?

338
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I don't know.

339
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,959
I was hoping he
would be here.

340
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,396
Ah.
Ladies and gentlemen.

341
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,151
Uh, my name is Alfred Thaddeus
Crane Pennyworth.

342
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,119
And I'd very much like
to welcome you

343
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,113
on behalf of Wayne Enterprises
and Bruce Wayne

344
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,269
to the, uh, future... of Gotham.

345
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,716
<i>As you know, ten years ago,
the battle...</i>

346
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,076
Oh, come on.

347
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,675
Where is that brat?

348
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,714
Hello, Ed.

349
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,879
Barbara Kean.

350
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,516
In red.

351
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,471
Oh, no.

352
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,195
Please tell me you are not here
to stop me.

353
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,679
Barbara...

354
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,958
Do you even remember how
amazing you used to be?

355
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,953
Honey, I'm still amazing.

356
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,316
I just made a choice.

357
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,391
You made a choice.

358
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
Some of us don't get
to make choices.

359
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,511
I'm The Riddler.

360
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,559
And tonight Gotham
will remember that.

361
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,757
By blowing up this ding-dong?

362
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,069
Didn't you do that already?

363
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,389
It's a callback.

364
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,949
I was waiting for Bruce
to begin his speech.

365
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,875
You know, come out,
present a riddle.

366
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,316
Only Bruce doesn't
seem to want to show.

367
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,959
So I think
I'm gonna have to imp...

368
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,396
Sorry, Ed.

369
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,872
Not tonight.

370
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,237
Wayne Enterprises
will devote itself

371
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,357
to making this future a reality.

372
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,873
Lee.

373
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,191
- Jim.
- I'm fine. Evacuate the building.

374
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,034
- Get these people out of here.
- Help!

375
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,520
Gordon!

376
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,990
Help! Gordon!

377
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,673
Gordon, help!

378
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,638
This lunatic.

379
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,393
He kidnapped me again.

380
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,233
He tried to blow me up. Again!

381
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,879
But we stopped him.

382
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,360
You're welcome.

383
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,496
Take care of the mayor, please.

384
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,874
Get that thing off of him.

385
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,599
Excuse me.

386
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,856
There were four crates of C-4.

387
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,314
Where are the rest?

388
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,880
That's all he gave me.

389
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,997
- He said Penguin broke him out.
- No.

390
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,576
It wasn't Penguin.
Get him out of there.

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
What?

392
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,231
Hey! Get off me.

393
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,480
Penguin not's just the patsy.

394
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,233
He's not even the real threat.

395
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,674
Which means there must be...

396
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,954
If this bomb goes off

397
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,396
and Wayne Tower falls,
it'll take out other buildings.

398
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,720
A lot of people are gonna die.

399
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,712
You all need to leave right now.

400
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,837
So you can stay?
Absolutely not.

401
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,036
It's too late.

402
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,634
We'd never get far enough away.

403
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,599
Ms. Kean is right;
this stops right here.

404
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
So how do we defuse it?

405
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,196
We'd have to sever
the connectors to the detonator,

406
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,496
but the bomber
must have hidden it.

407
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,034
The wires go up inside
the model.

408
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,077
It must be in one
of the buildings.

409
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
I tracked down a gang today...

410
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,318
they had bomb-making materials,

411
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,119
pictures of buildings.

412
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,479
One in particular:

413
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,309
Gotham Clock Tower.

414
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,672
Let's go.

415
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,755
In here.

416
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,434
Wait, wait, wait.

417
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,036
Wait. This particular detonator
has a gyroscope.

418
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,080
Which means someone will have
to hold it up and steady

419
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,833
while you detach
the wires from below.

420
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,355
I have doctor's hands,
I can do it.

421
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,117
Fine. Lucius.

422
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,792
All right,
the trigger connection

423
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,190
should be different
than the others.

424
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,472
Okay, I see two green wires.

425
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,836
I'm gonna cut this one.

426
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,056
- The other one. The other one.
- The other one.

427
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,560
- The other one.
- Yes, the other one.

428
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,713
Never doubted you for a minute.

429
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,269
Strange.

430
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,195
We designed a new clock tower,
but this is the old one.

431
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,600
That's the answer.

432
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,629
Who's behind
all this, but...

433
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,795
but it's not possible.

434
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,075
Sir.

435
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,152
Sir, Nygma's vanished.

436
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,560
There's more.

437
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,440
Mayor James ordered Bullock
sent to Blackgate.

438
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,834
He's about to be moved.

439
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,276
Stop! Stop!

440
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,990
The person who framed you,

441
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,336
the one behind Nygma's breakout,

442
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,856
is it who I think it is?
Has he been faking it?

443
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,349
Jim, do not say his name!

444
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,033
Is it Jeremiah Valeska?

445
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,393
Harvey.

446
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,994
Check him for a wire!
What?

447
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,515
Under his shirt.
Check for a wire.

448
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,155
Oh, God, it's too late.

449
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,512
He's miked.

450
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,910
Jim, you don't know
what he'll do.

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,231
I-I don't know about this.

452
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,993
How much is it again?

453
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,914
Ten bucks is a body punch.
$20, you get the face.

454
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,354
Stabbing him is a C-note.

455
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,556
Huh.

456
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,680
Bad news, boss.

457
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,400
Our cover's blownskies.

458
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,119
Edward Nygma.

459
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,352
It is very good to see you.

460
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,990
Oswald... I thought
you weren't behind this.

461
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm not.

462
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,834
But I thought you might need
some help,

463
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,674
and... what else
are friends for?

464
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,754
You look well.

465
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,911
You, too.

466
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,136
A little thicker
in the middle.

467
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,876
Damn, it's good
to see you, Oswald.

468
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,517
Wh-What was that?
What was that?

469
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,756
What the hell was that?!

470
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,750
Alfred, when Bruce came
to me the day he got back

471
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
and told me what he was
planning, I didn't hesitate.

472
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,439
I believe in what he's doing,

473
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,352
but he's going
to need some help.

474
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,112
Has he thought
about telling Gordon?

475
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,635
Lucius, my old friend,

476
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
whoever Bruce decides to take
on this journey with him,

477
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,752
it's his decision.

478
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,390
Our role... is to serve.

479
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,909
Down!

480
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,912
- Get me down!
- Aah!

481
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,637
Something happened
tonight, didn't it?

482
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,915
Why won't you tell me?

483
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,560
Because everything
worked out okay, didn't it?

484
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,476
So why are we at your old club?

485
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,392
Because Mommy just needs
to get something.

00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,400
Easy.

496
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,437
It's just
a surprise party.

497
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,276
For you, Barbara Kean,

498
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,556
queen of Gotham,

499
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,917
business titan.
How exciting.

500
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,438
But there was another you,
I...

501
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,318
I seem to recall.

502
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,470
Wasn't there?

503
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,153
Then again, there was, uh,

504
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,277
another me, too.

505
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,319
Oh, so hard holding on
to what's real. It's...

506
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,153
It's enough to drive you mad.

507
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,671
No!

508
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,877
Mom!

509
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,872
Cute.

510
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,631
She has your eyes.

511
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,200
For now.

512
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,549
No, put me down.

513
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,632
I...

514
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,632
think she...

515
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,871
nicked me, Daddy.

516
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,599
I...

517
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,273
Oh, boy.

518
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,397
Oh, dear me.

519
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,233
My sweet Ecco,

520
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
no longer my echo.

521
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,760
There will never be one
like you.

522
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,439
Really?

523
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,834
But I suppose
there are other fish in the sea.

524
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Let me...

525
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,150
down.

526
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,754
- Mom!
- Hush,

527
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,197
little Barbaras,
don't say a word.

528
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,431
Now we're going
to play a...

529
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,159
little game.

530
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,272
By now, James Gordon
should have made it

531
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,680
to your apartment.

532
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,877
When he gets here,
I want you to deliver

533
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,474
a message. Okay?

534
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,200
Okay?

535
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,833
Okay?

536
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Barbara.

537
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,712
I'll call an ambulance.

538
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,952
Barbara.

539
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
He took her!

540
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,079
That lunatic took her!

541
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,231
He said you have to come,
and if you don't come,

542
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,390
he's gonna kill her.

543
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,715
Where?

544
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,791
The place
where he was born again.

545
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,119
He means Ace Chemicals.

546
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,836
You promise me.

547
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,872
I'll bring her back.

548
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,869
Come along, Commissioner.

549
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,553
We're waiting.

550
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,476
The party's raging,

551
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,031
but it's well past the
princess's bedtime.

552
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,911
It's funny, being back here.

553
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,550
I can still
feel my flesh

554
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,552
sizzle
as it melted away.

555
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,120
Burns even now.

556
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,271
Ooh. Oh.

557
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm here.

558
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,959
Everything's gonna be fine.

559
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,918
You think so?

560
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,357
Personally, I'd say things are
about as far away from fine

561
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,636
as they could possibly be,
Barbara Lee.

562
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,430
What do I know? I did just
spend the last ten years

563
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,477
in the funny farm.

564
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,711
What do you want,
Jeremiah?

565
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,594
Is there a Jeremiah here?

566
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,833
So what do I call you?

567
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Uh...

568
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,639
I don't know.

569
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,837
Call me... Jack.

570
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,200
Mm, no, no, no,
that's not right.

571
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,311
J-Joseph. John. Jay.

572
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,920
I-I don't know. I just...

573
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,913
I feel something
new crawling

574
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,117
from the primordial ooze
that was me.

575
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,674
Something...

576
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,672
beautiful.

577
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,876
How long have you been
pretending to be brain-dead?

578
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,395
How long have <i>you</i>
been pretending?

579
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,597
That's a joke. I know
you're not pretending.

580
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,239
That's far enough, James.

581
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,319
But you still
haven't told me.

582
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,314
Why?

583
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,237
Why keep pretending?

584
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,996
I was waiting for him
to come home.

585
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,479
We're bound
together, he and I.

586
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,636
It's the one thing I knew
for certain, the one thing

587
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,837
I knew was true.

588
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,353
And then he just...

589
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,830
abandoned us.

590
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,000
Do you know how it feels
to have the one,

591
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,396
the only thing you love

592
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,199
ripped away from you?

593
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,229
It feels like this.

594
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,720
No!

595
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,917
Disappointing as tonight was,

596
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,878
I will say,
it is fun carving up

597
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,917
Filet-O-Commissioner.

598
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,280
Who's there?!

599
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,033
What do you want?!

600
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,270
Show yourself!

601
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,359
Show yourself!

602
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,350
You.

603
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,991
It's okay.
It's all right.

604
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,470
I got you, okay?

605
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,312
So, he comes out of nowhere,

606
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,438
saves you <i>and</i> Barbara Lee,

607
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,398
and just disappears?

608
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Yeah.

609
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,711
So, the dude's on our side?

610
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,031
I think so.

611
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,476
Hey, this old thing.

612
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,791
I thought we, uh, mothballed
this after reunification.

613
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,234
I had 'em dig it out

614
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,913
for old times' sake.

615
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,151
I sent a note to Wayne Manor.

616
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,472
I thought Bruce might want
to be here when we light it.

617
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,040
Good evening, gentlemen.

618
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,838
Master Bruce sends
his profound apologies.

619
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,116
He's otherwise engaged.

620
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,030
He's been busy a lot
since he came back.

621
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,440
Yes, indeed.

622
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,470
And I hear that you're retiring.

623
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I may stick around

624
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,476
a while yet.

625
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,639
You're there, aren't you?

626
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,077
Do you have any idea
what you did...

627
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,751
...just leaving?

628
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,680
You were all I had.

629
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,437
And I know you wanted
to protect me.

630
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,639
But I didn't want
to be protected.

631
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,030
I wanted you.

632
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,717
Say something.

633
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,269
Say something.

634
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,116
There was no
other way, Selina.

635
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,677
I had to go.

636
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,795
So what happens now?

637
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,272
I don't know.

638
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,039
But I'll never
leave Gotham again.

639
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,712
Return the diamond.

640
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
Like hell.

641
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,639
"Gotham is mine."
That's what he said.

642
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,040
I was there, Oswald.

643
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,589
I did not spend ten years
in Blackgate

644
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,479
to give my city to a man
dressed like a bat!

645
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,835
Yes!

646
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,271
Go!

647
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,599
We have to find out
who he is

648
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,637
and show him that this
is <i>our</i> city!

649
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Agreed.

650
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,558
Tomorrow?

651
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,197
Tomorrow.

652
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,079
Yet in the darkness,

653
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,152
there will be light.

654
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,856
That's what you
promised Master Bruce

655
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,678
all those years
ago in the alley.

656
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,870
You saved him.

657
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,712
Gave him hope.

658
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,671
Holy Mother.

659
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,753
Who is he?

660
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,236
A friend.
