1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,196
There are some things we need to discuss.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,154
Our friend Jimmy McCavern
has asked for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,475
north of Wincanton.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,034
I said yes.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,073
- In return for what?
- No return.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,635
None.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,595
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,791
It would have been a kindness.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,839
Now get out.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,394
This is a cheque guarantee.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,352
Signed by Mosley.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,672
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,471
The consequence of good intentions.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,073
My good intentions.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,599
Push the button.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,916
Unlock the door and come home to me.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,479
I have a job for you.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,472
I'll come for you...

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,398
...after midnight on Wednesday.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,954
Barney Thomason...

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,676
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,518
While he's on stage.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,153
While I'm stood next to him.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,833
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,316
It's going to be a busy few weeks,
brother.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,116
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,194
Yes, Mr Churchill.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,714
Irish over Scotch.

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,270
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,510
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,759
Grandmother in a tent.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,711
My mother on a narrow boat.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,516
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,877
A man needs to prove he is better than me

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,310
rather than show me his birth certificate.

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,991
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,078
You speak beautifully in the House.

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,873
- Thank you.
- And believe

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,832
not a word of what you are saying.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,917
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,350
You read Greek literature.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,834
I have trouble sleeping.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,833
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,515
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,352
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,238
You are spying on him.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,158
Yes.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,270
Why?

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,153
The honest answer is...

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,354
...I'm no longer sure.

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,757
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a gardener.

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,799
In fact, I have three gardeners.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,676
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,117
...who are happier than I will ever be.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,074
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,714
that there are certain species of weed

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,116
that no matter how much you tug at them,

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,674
poison them,

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,076
they continue to grow back.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,070
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,873
create a field of mud

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,833
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,914
That's what you and I did in France.

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,670
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,556
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,991
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,236
That's why you oppose him.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,829
Yeah.

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,394
Your mystery solved.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,874
What is your strategy?

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,157
I won't burden you with it.

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,078
You're going to break the law.

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,715
I need to sleep.

76
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,271
You said you don't sleep.

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,277
I said I have trouble sleeping.

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,550
As do 1.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,235
As do 1.

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,239
Mr Shelby...

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,280
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,394
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,557
both working to the same end.

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,033
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,039
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,794
And if you need anything, call me.

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,718
There are some times, some nights...

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,995
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

89
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
That old dance routine.

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,798
I put out a cigar,

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,072
and an hour later I want another.

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,673
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
But use it anyway.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,318
A tent.

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,714
Then a boat.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,353
Then a house.

97
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,391
Now a mansion.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,511
That's something.

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,675
Isn't it?

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, that is something.

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,551
By the way...

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,635
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
I forget his name.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,793
Major Campbell.

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,514
Yes, Campbell.

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,278
No.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
It was my aunt.

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,354
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,278
and spend an evening with your family.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,473
They sound interesting.

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,079
Yes.

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,077
They'd like that.

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,593
I got to Harold French,
refereeing Liverpool. He just wants cash.

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,791
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

115
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,560
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,956
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,235
Finn.

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,309
You don't knock?

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,073
No, Finn.

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,316
I don't knock.

121
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,189
Right.

122
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,029
Hello, Billy.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,872
How are you, mate?

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,399
Good, Mr Shelby.

125
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,750
Yeah, you look good.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,156
That's a nice suit.

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,634
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,239
He earned that suit.

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,591
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,710
He's a good man.

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,480
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,591
You're coming up in the world, I like it.

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,837
How's the missus, hmm?

134
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,878
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,149
She moved out.

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,271
Oh, that's a shame.

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,630
Mind if I join you, eh?

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,038
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

139
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,473
You're a good man, Billy.

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,113
You're a good man, eh?

141
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,079
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,157
And what did we do, eh?

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,434
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

144
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,995
reveals himself.

145
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,430
The truth is young, Billy boy.

146
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,994
Yeah.

147
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,554
Here, look.

148
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,035
What have we got here? Oh, look.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,549
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,239
Then there's some snow there, look.

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,035
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

152
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,958
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

153
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,309
Well, I do too.

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,592
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

155
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,950
Eh? Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,110
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

158
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,709
Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

159
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,194
I do apologise.

160
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,357
And you. Hmm?

161
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,550
Look at you.

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,116
Sitting here with your mate, eh?
Your best mate.

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,833
Well, while you're sitting here,

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,236
talking about our business,

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,273
drinking whiskey, smoking and sniffing...

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,198
And working.

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,711
You remember, you tell this man

168
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,309
about our family business...

169
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,152
...and it's his life you're risking.

170
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,918
Cos people talk, Finn.

171
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,554
We...we only ever talk about football
and women, Mr Shelby.

172
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,395
Football and women,

173
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,716
we only ever...we only ever talk
about football and women.

174
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,558
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,353
It's...

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,913
Yeah.

177
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,800
Come on.

178
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,354
Family meeting, let's go.

179
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,711
You're not eating right.
You're not eating right.

180
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,913
You're not getting the natural things
in you, boy, that's what it is, always.

181
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,711
You bearing up, Arthur?

182
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,399
Bearing up for what?

183
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,830
Bearing up to being free, Pol.

184
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,672
Another glass, eh?

185
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,916
Another glass of so what.

186
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,632
Are you all right, Charlie?

187
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,875
Mad bastard Barney kicked me
in the shin when I woke him up.

188
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,320
Where is the mad bastard?

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,469
He's tied to a lamp-post outside
with three Lee boys,

190
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,591
shitting themselves.

191
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,233
A drink.

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
First of all,

193
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,829
an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,510
Charles has a violin concert.

195
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,350
Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

196
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,951
He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,994
From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,033
First item of business, a bereavement.

199
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,999
Colonel Ben Younger,

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,556
who may perhaps have become
a member of this family,

201
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,193
was taken from us,

202
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,391
four days ago,

203
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,193
by dark forces.

204
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,630
We've made some investigations,

205
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,717
and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

206
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,480
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,353
and the baby inside of her,

208
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,871
who may one day sit at these meetings,

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,550
but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,115
Let's drink to happier circumstances.

211
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,594
Yeah.

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,269
To Ada.

213
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,791
- To Ada.
- Ada.

214
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,394
Item number two.

215
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,954
An announcement,

216
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,150
regarding Michael.

217
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,238
Before you go on, Tommy,

218
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,194
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

219
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,312
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

220
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,909
According to your own estimations,

221
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,715
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,753
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

223
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,030
Therefore,

224
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,549
due to the amounts involved,

225
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,717
I think this company
should be restructured.

226
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,629
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

227
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,955
Restructured in what way?

228
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,037
Because of the amounts
of money involved,

229
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,992
shipment and dispatch will become

230
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,589
the primary source of income
to the company.

231
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,234
It's simple mathematics.

232
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,589
And with the help of my wife,

233
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,553
I will organise an expansion into America,

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,752
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

235
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,633
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

236
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,390
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

237
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,955
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

238
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,434
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,914
with a regular supply

240
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,713
of pure opium from China,

241
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,116
within a short space of time,

242
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,997
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

243
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,150
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

244
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,190
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,879
they're on the inside,

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,513
not on the outside.

247
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,836
And as a member of the new generation,

248
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,749
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

249
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,396
A new decade is coming.

250
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,592
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

251
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,313
More money than we've ever had before.

252
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,672
Tommy,

253
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,031
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,278
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

255
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,755
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

256
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,439
Fuck Linda.

257
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,430
Finn.

258
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,070
You've proved yourself.

259
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,038
You're part of the new generation.

260
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,917
You could come to New York with me.

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,277
Here is my proposal.

262
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,957
A full restructuring of the company.

263
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,152
I will be managing director.

264
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,430
And you can be non executive chairman.

265
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,552
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

266
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,199
I've found the name of a dead man.

267
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,392
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

268
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,749
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

269
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,432
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

270
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,190
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

271
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,438
At least read it with an open mind.

272
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,994
It's cold in here, Michael.

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,830
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

274
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,314
Item number three.

275
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,716
Tell him the truth.

276
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,875
Go on.

277
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,797
He can take it.

278
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,710
Tell me the truth, Michael.

279
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,353
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

280
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,437
Those days are done.

281
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,234
Tommy. He's bitten through
the fucking rope.

282
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,555
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

283
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,557
Go and get him!

284
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,557
Fuck the Americans.

285
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

286
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,519
It's time.

287
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,435
And you know it.

288
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,438
Tommy, Mum's leaving...

289
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,877
...John's dead, Arthur needs help,

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,550
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

291
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,751
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

292
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,359
Like the good old days.

293
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,430
Or...

294
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,836
...see this for what it is.

295
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,233
A natural succession...

296
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,953
...that someday must happen.

297
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,109
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

298
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,794
Don't be here when I get back.

299
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,910
You.

300
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,719
You can tell your family...

301
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,797
Let me guess.

302
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,558
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

303
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,119
Right?

304
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,796
Well...

305
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,116
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

306
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,917
They're not fucking voices!

307
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,158
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,477
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

309
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,999
Barney!

310
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,229
Barney!

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,355
Put down the gun. At ease.

312
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,835
Finn.

313
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,952
At ease, soldier. At ease.

314
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,991
Look at me. You're on our side.

315
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,031
You're at home.

316
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,355
You're at home.

317
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,710
Yeah? Yeah.

318
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,673
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

319
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,632
Yeah.

320
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

321
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,589
The devil will now be an angel.

322
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,711
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

323
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,910
Come, brother.

324
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,633
Let me give you the good news.

325
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,034
Jesus loves you.

326
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,474
So, where the fuck is he?

327
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,670
All right, boys.

328
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,749
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,071
Right.

330
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,713
Let's have the good stuff.

331
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,990
None of that shit ponces' drink.

332
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,077
Here we go, look.

333
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,953
All right, so item number three.

334
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,912
An introduction.

335
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,159
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,112
In France, he was a comrade.

337
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

338
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,115
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

339
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,959
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

340
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,038
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

341
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,711
Aberama,

342
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,754
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

343
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,917
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

344
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,271
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

345
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,198
What actions?

346
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,754
A killing.

347
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,031
And since when
did you worry about the police?

348
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,675
Barney Thomason...

349
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,832
...is gonna kill an MP.

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,793
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

351
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,230
What the fuck, Tom?

352
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,551
After the killing,

353
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,194
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

354
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,469
and Intelligence forces.

355
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,393
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

356
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
We need there to be no connection to us.

357
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,556
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

358
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,069
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

359
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,032
He has known grievances.

360
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,119
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

361
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,595
by a single gunman acting alone.

362
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,917
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

363
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,270
If they catch him,

364
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,677
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

365
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,440
just send him back to where I found him.

366
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,233
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

367
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,715
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

368
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,797
And where will this killing take place?

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,670
There you go.

370
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,350
He'll be on stage.

371
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,630
With lots...

372
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>...of witnesses.</i>

373
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,191
During the rally,

374
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,994
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

375
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,033
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

376
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,833
And we're organizing this demonstration?

377
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,075
Yeah.

378
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,918
Where will you be, Tom?

379
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,430
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

380
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,999
...While the life drains from him.

381
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,119
Then I'll make a speech...

382
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,789
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

383
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,079
...continue safe in my hands.

384
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,435
Holy fuck.

385
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,114
Tommy...

386
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,272
...does your ambition have no limits?

387
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,393
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

388
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,159
He'll probably be in the wings.

389
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

390
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,951
What do you want us to do, Tom?

391
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,071
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

392
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,760
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

393
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,110
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

394
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,719
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

395
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,831
No. I will medicate him.

396
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,430
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

397
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,791
In France, he never missed...

398
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,433
...no matter what they gave him.

399
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,189
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

400
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,038
Before he takes the shot,

401
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,199
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

402
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,913
So just...

403
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,713
You're gonna be up on the stage

404
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,958
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

405
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,357
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

406
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,351
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

407
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,791
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

408
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,914
After the killing,

409
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,431
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

410
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,710
Use that opportunity

411
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,151
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

412
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

413
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,477
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

414
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,718
£250,000.

415
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,353
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

416
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,357
in recognition of extra services.

417
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,791
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!

418
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,159
Anyone who wants to leave,
leave now.

419
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,671
Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

420
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,759
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

421
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,510
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

422
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,755
Good.

423
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,636
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

424
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,831
Johnny, bring the van round.

425
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,952
What's the fire for, Tom?

426
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,711
There is an item number four.

427
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,349
It's time.

428
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,113
Jeez, Mr Shelby.

429
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,993
If I'd have known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

430
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,634
Here, Micky.

431
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,670
Sit down there.

432
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,434
So I'll have a drink, will I?

433
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,153
Here you go, have a drink.

434
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,751
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

435
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,435
To collect some cargo.

436
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,751
I was met by the Titanic boys.

437
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,952
They knew I was coming.

438
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,909
Yeah. When, where, what time.

439
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,155
They even knew...

440
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,750
...the cargo I was picking up.

441
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,075
Jesus.

442
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,111
Four days ago, Micky...

443
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,519
...a soldier was killed...

444
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,914
...outside my office...

445
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,270
...by a bomb.

446
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,030
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

447
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,309
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

448
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,239
No. It weren't the IRA.

449
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,269
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

450
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,515
They're friends of mine.

451
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,594
I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

452
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,995
They told me that...

453
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,239
...30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

454
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,876
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

455
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,355
He now offers his services for cash.

456
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,277
Paddy Rose.

457
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,630
Yeah, me and my brother,
we spoke to Paddy.

458
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,069
At length.

459
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,959
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

460
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,315
Yeah, we spoke to him.

461
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,997
We killed him, Micky.

462
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,394
Paddy Rose is dead.

463
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,636
We weighed him down,

464
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,751
we sunk him...

465
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,030
...to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.

466
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,750
The girls at the exchange
gave me the number

467
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,030
of the man that called, Micky,
before the explosion.

468
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,434
That was your number.

469
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,519
Micky, it was you who called him.

470
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,910
You tipped him off.

471
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,755
You were told to call him

472
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,315
if a black man of a certain description
ever came to Small Heath.

473
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,635
We know you've...you've been giving
the Titanic boys information as well.

474
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,190
We know that.

475
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,993
Yeah.

476
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,078
You've been working behind the bar, hmm?

477
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,671
Seeing what goes on, listening,
taking notes,

478
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,555
and selling your stories
to the highest bidder. Hmm?

479
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,231
Yeah.

480
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,316
Come on.

481
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,270
Come on, man.

482
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,519
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

483
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,354
I'm sorry, Mr Shelby.

484
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,636
Don't look at Tommy.

485
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
The ceiling would be cheaper, brother.

486
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,109
Micky!

487
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,798
Fucking hell, Arthur.

488
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,271
Shaking like the hand of a normal man.

489
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,276
What about item five, Tom?

490
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,477
There is an item five, right, Tommy?

491
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,591
I'm fucking sinking here, man.

492
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,239
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.

493
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,837
You...you...you said there's an item five.

494
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,553
Say it, Tommy.

495
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,594
Item five could start now, Tommy.

496
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,997
It could start this year, a new decade.

497
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,634
M-M-Michael...

498
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,149
Michael could be right -
we could go, Tommy.

499
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,998
We could go.

500
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,077
We could fucking leave this place.

501
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,918
We could leave it to the kids.

502
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,475
Michael's... He might be right.

503
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,511
- He might be fucking right.
- Arthur!

504
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,554
There is no item number five!

505
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,396
Go and check
that Polly is still on our side.

506
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,239
I have to go to Margate.

507
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,634
All right, Tom.

508
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,874
All right, brother!

509
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,871
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

510
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,394
You out there, Tommy?

511
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,431
Yeah. I'm here.

512
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,589
I was just having some oil rubbed
into the bits that really hurt, mate.

513
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,792
What do you think of that view, eh?

514
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,311
It's Margate. What can you do?

515
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,149
I'll tell you something, Tommy, right?

516
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,557
I sit all day every day in that chair,

517
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,514
on that balcony,
contemplating the fact, right,

518
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,917
that life is so much easier to deal with
when you are dead!

519
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,713
- Hello, Alfie.
- Yeah.

520
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,831
Did you...did you look
through the binoculars?

521
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,030
Yeah.

522
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,231
I watch ships. No two are the same.

523
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,192
Yeah.

524
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,756
That is how God sees us both, in his eyes.

525
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,234
God, eh?

526
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,839
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know.

527
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,759
Someone's responsible
for all this fucking mess.

528
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,276
Now...

529
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,199
How soon did you know
that I was not dead?

530
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,833
You wrote me a letter, Alfie.

531
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,155
Did I?

532
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,032
Yeah, you asked about your dog.

533
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,720
They gave me a lot of drugs at first.

534
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,400
Hmm. Yeah, all right.

535
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,158
I was lying out there,

536
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,193
and the tide had come in,
and it woke me up.

537
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,994
I remember looking around
and thinking, you know...

538
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,390
..."Fuck...

539
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,398
"...if this is hell...

540
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,477
"...it looks a lot like Margate."

541
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,592
Maybe that's just what hell looks like,

542
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,509
No, no, not according
to this holy book right here, yeah?

543
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,758
It gives a very, very vivid description.

544
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,678
You and I are both fucked, mate.

545
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,392
Do you read the papers, Alfie?

546
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,352
No, don't be silly.

547
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,835
But you've heard.

548
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,712
What, fascism, yeah?

549
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,755
Three,

550
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,473
two,

551
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,318
one,

552
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,919
bang.

553
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,110
No?

554
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,759
Fine.

555
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,475
Good Lord, your fucking condition
has got worse, mate.

556
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,353
Mine, on the other hand,

557
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,118
I've been living the dream.

558
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,232
Sometimes, I will shoot
at the side of a ship.

559
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,113
And sometimes I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.

560
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,435
Alfie...

561
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,710
...I'm gonna shoot Oswald Mosley.

562
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,069
Right, well...

563
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,232
...]I hope you do a better job on him
than the one you done on me, yeah?

564
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,356
I mean, what...what were you thinking?
Was your mind somewhere else, Tommy?

565
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,798
Yes, it was, actually.

566
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,231
Yeah, all right.

567
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,998
Oh, look.

568
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,195
A ship.

569
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,159
Why do you want to shoot him?

570
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,198
I need to organize a riot, Alfie.

571
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,276
Right.

572
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,280
And I hear you still have some...standing

573
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,710
in the Jewish community.

574
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,196
Let me be clear, right?

575
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,675
Since my resurrection,

576
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,589
I am considered to be a god, all right?

577
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,953
In the Holy Land,
someone has made an image of me

578
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,436
out of rock embedded in the sand,
so I'm told,

579
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,076
and I am planning to make
a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.

580
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,389
Are you going to shoot him
because this man is evil?

581
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,954
I need men who can fight.

582
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,829
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.

583
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,033
So if the men causing the trouble
are Jewish it will be...explicable.

584
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,800
Since when did you need explanations,
Tommy?

585
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,797
Since I entered politics.

586
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,479
Oh, that's right, yeah.

587
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,672
Oh, yeah.
And how has that been for you, Tom?

588
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,951
Gangs, wars, truces...

589
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,037
Nothing I didn't already know.

590
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,994
So you think if you kill him, you...
you will kill the message, yeah?

591
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,636
I will kill the man,

592
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,512
then I will kill the message.

593
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,594
How much you paying?

594
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,439
I thought you might do it for the cause,
Alfie.

595
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,550
Fuck off.

596
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,558
Each man will get £20.

597
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,557
You'll get £5,000.

598
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,239
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,

599
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,038
I am now able to just rise above
those kinds of insults, mate.

600
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,673
Ten?

601
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,149
How is my dog?

602
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,750
Your dog is fine.

603
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,311
In that case, ten should be enough.

604
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,555
Where do you want the men?

605
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,590
Birmingham.

606
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,790
No. No.

607
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,672
20 will not be enough

608
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,189
for my lads to step inside
that fucking shit-hole.

609
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,153
It will have to be 25 at least.

610
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,880
25 it is.
You can take your dog back, then, eh?

611
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,469
No, it's better for him
to think that I am still dead.

612
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,076
As it is also with the police.

613
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,189
Right.

614
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,197
So you're still at it, eh, Tommy?

615
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,197
You ain't got no Margate to go to.

616
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,954
No.

617
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,156
And I have no interest
in shooting seagulls.

618
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,113
Oh, you have
in shooting Cabinet ministers?

619
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,230
Yeah.

620
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,839
And their paid informants.

621
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,159
I was on a lot of drugs at first, right,
due to the pain, you know,

622
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,759
on account of it...

623
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,398
Well, you know,
being shot in the face by...some cunt.

624
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,399
I won't bore you with the details
of the trivia.

625
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,751
Nonetheless, I had a recurring dream.

626
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,069
I saw you in a field, right?

627
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,599
With a big black horse.

628
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,635
And you said goodbye, and then...bang.

629
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,119
All right, then. Well, what now?

630
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,670
I will continue...

631
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,835
...till I find a man that I can't defeat.

632
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,030
Arthur asked whose side I was on.

633
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,239
There will be a war.

634
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,960
And one of you will die.

635
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,795
But which one, I cannot tell.

636
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,629
He's gonna do it anyway.

637
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,680
- Yeah.
- You should know,

638
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,474
if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.

639
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,274
What about me?

640
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,236
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

641
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,753
Kill...and kill.

642
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,431
It's the only way to make people listen.

643
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,350
Soon you'll have a stage to stand on.

644
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,438
Millions of people will listen to you.

645
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,633
And you will run the country
like you run this family.

646
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,876
It appears to be what people want.

647
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,310
But not me.

648
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,592
Not any more.

649
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,597
My resignation.

650
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,994
If it's Barney you're worried about,
he's sleeping.

651
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,475
But I can't sleep
because my fucking leg is cracked.

652
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,957
Tell me how my mother went, Charlie.

653
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,432
You know.

654
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,880
She drowned.

655
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,590
I know it wasn't by accident.

656
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,999
Tell me the truth, Charlie.

657
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,838
The truth, Tommy, yeah?

658
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,519
The fucking truth.

659
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,515
Fuck's sake.

660
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,552
She just stepped into the canal.

661
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,719
Your dad was no use.

662
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,831
It was me trying to stop her,
for three days.

663
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,396
In the end, she did it anyway.

664
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,437
- Did she say why?
- Nothing that made sense.

665
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,756
Tell me the things
that didn't make sense.

666
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,029
She said it were the Gypsies
made the nails for Jesus's cross.

667
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,912
That's why we're cursed and restless.

668
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,191
Yeah, go on.

669
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,914
You have to move around
or the guilt catches up with you.

670
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,075
I said,
"Well, why not go on the road for a bit?"

671
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,553
She went to Worcester.

672
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,279
She came back with a white pony.

673
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,835
That one she gave to you.

674
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,510
You used to ride it round, remember?

675
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,715
Well, she seemed happy for a bit,
watching you ride it.

676
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,789
And then she was gone.

677
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,997
None of it made any sense.

678
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,476
Afterwards, whenever I looked
at that white pony, I saw her.

679
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,471
You see, I was in love with her, Tom.

680
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,554
No-one knew but me.

681
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,629
Broke my fucking heart
to pull her from the cut.

682
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,837
You know, your grandfather,
he went the same way.

683
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,917
Suicide.

684
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,190
Sometimes, these things run in the family.

685
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,071
Fuck family, Tom.

686
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,953
You just have to get on with it.

687
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,195
You're a Gypsy.

688
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,550
You have to move around,
or it all catches up with you.

689
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,277
Didn't need all them tablets,

690
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,836
just needed another fucking war, eh?

691
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,150
Perish Judah.

692
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,679
Perish Judah.

693
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,796
Shalom, my friends. Shalom.

694
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,558
Shalom. Shalom.

695
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,234
In you go, buddy.

696
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,592
Show these fascist bastards no mercy,
brothers.

697
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,993
The Jew and the Gypsy united.

698
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,475
Look, I have got to go, yeah?
I have to go.

699
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,829
Go where?

700
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,633
They're shooting a fascist tonight.

701
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,034
You're gonna do what?

702
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,309
Ssh.

703
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,796
Mosley's in town.

704
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,274
Really?

705
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,153
Look, go into town,

706
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,271
get some drink and some girl

707
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,596
and listen to the radio.

708
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,473
We will not stand by and let this scum
have free rein in our city!

709
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,117
Fascism must not be allowed to voice
its creed of hatred.

710
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,631
Out the fucking way!

711
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,879
We have a right to protest!

712
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,274
Get back!

713
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,438
Anybody heckles you,
beat the fuck out of them.

714
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,911
We have a right to protest!

715
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,111
We got another one. Let's go. Get, get!

716
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,435
Calm yourself down.

717
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,837
It's not against the law to protest.

718
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,958
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Out of the way.

719
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,990
Let her go.

720
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,952
- I don't need the help of a fascist.
- Yes, you do.

721
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,072
At Steelhouse Lane,
they'll do whatever they want to you.

722
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,190
Let her go.

723
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,557
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering you
to let her fucking go. Go on.

724
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,469
Fuck you.

725
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,594
Jessie, you can do more damage
from the inside.

726
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,711
Do you understand?

727
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,400
You can do more damage from the inside.

728
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,233
Come on.

729
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,475
Come on.

730
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,399
Out of the way. Out of the way.

731
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,954
Shut up!

732
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,072
Here, look.

733
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,838
There, look.

734
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,433
I'll join you.

735
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,074
Play high.

736
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,679
Now, you know what you're doing,
don't you?

737
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,950
Yeah. Tommy checks his pocket watch,

738
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,115
I count ten,

739
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,878
then I blow the other bloke's head off.

740
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

741
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,994
There, that's for after.

742
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,270
Thank you. Thank you.

743
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,232
- See you later, Arthur.
- Oh, soldier.

744
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,990
Soldier, you do that, you run like fuck.

745
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,838
- Don't stop.
- Run like fuck.

746
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,837
- Yeah.
- Run like fuck.

747
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,073
In here.

748
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,394
Here, for your face.

749
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,193
At least I have only one face.

750
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,199
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?

751
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,640
I have a strategy.

752
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,319
You always have a strategy.

753
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,396
But it's dangerous,

754
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,955
and it can't be shared
without sharing the danger.

755
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,354
You think I'm afraid?

756
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,871
No, but it's only gonna put you
in more danger.

757
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,118
Jessie, before the speeches start,
just go home.

758
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,878
There's gonna be lots of arrests.

759
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,229
You have a mark against your name.

760
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,998
Why?

761
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,315
What's going to happen?

762
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,635
I'm gonna do a good thing.

763
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,352
Whenever I do a good thing,

764
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,517
innocent people get hurt.

765
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,675
So go home.

766
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,237
After this evening, we can meet,
discuss strategy.

767
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,557
That beast out there, he's just a beast.

768
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,478
It's like a horse.

769
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,513
It's the rider that decides
what direction it takes.

770
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,869
And who will be the rider?

771
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,509
Just go home.

772
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,315
Full?

773
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,192
To the fucking brim.

774
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,590
Trouble?

775
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,438
So far, a few communists.

776
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,194
Bullers helped our boys clear them away.

777
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,073
Well, a few hecklers are a good thing.

778
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,589
We can illustrate
how we deal with opposition.

779
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,429
There is a rumour a gang of Jews
are coming up from Digbeth.

780
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,119
No sign of them yet.

781
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,833
Well, let them come.

782
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,553
Welcome them appropriately.

783
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,871
There are a few Peaky boys around.

784
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,349
They are your allies.

785
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,596
There'll be no rifts between us.

786
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,438
Keep your powder dry.

787
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,278
Mr McCavern?

788
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,631
Perish Judah.

789
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,879
No joke, Mr McCavern.

790
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,950
Perish Judah.

791
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,554
You turn the radio on
and turn up the volume.

792
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,398
I want to listen to the news.

793
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

794
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,915
Mr Oswald Mosley.

795
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,869
Perish Judah!

796
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,995
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

797
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,953
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

798
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,550
Perish Judah! Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

799
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,153
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

800
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,954
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

801
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,473
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

802
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,638
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

803
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,353
Perish Judah!

804
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,316
Welcome, men and women
of Birmingham.

805
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,274
Thank you for coming here
on this cold, dark night,

806
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,075
in spite of the obstruction
and provocation of our enemies.

807
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,472
Our enemies deal in bricks and stones

808
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,470
and bottles. We deal in reasoned
principle, argument and fact.

809
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,271
Among those enemies,
we can number Mr Winston Churchill,

810
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,474
who last night condemned me
in the House as a threat to democracy.

811
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,277
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

812
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,799
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

813
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,511
But then Mr Churchill has never been
a friend of the common people.

814
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,870
Faced with the alternative

815
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,469
of saying goodbye to the gold standard,

816
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,069
and therefore to his own employment,

817
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,352
he characteristically selected the latter,

818
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,959
but of course...

819
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,754
...not all attending tonight

820
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,871
will be convinced of our cause.

821
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,597
Some will have come here tonight
to find out for themselves

822
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,836
what we stand for.

823
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,634
Whenever you're ready, Tom.

824
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,718
So here are our guiding principles.

825
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,754
Every citizen shall serve the state.

826
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,350
Not the banks, not factions,

827
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,756
not the Jews!

828
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,275
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

829
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,034
The barriers of class will be abolished

830
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,912
and a greater Britain will be born

831
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,920
of the national socialist
and fascist creed.

832
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,476
It is useless to hide from ourselves
the fact that ever since 1918,

833
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,989
when our heroes returned from France,

834
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,910
our empire has shown all the signs
of disintegration,

835
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,432
and our people are threatened
by gathering disaster.

836
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,432
Get out of my way!

837
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,789
Out of the way!

838
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,273
Go. Go.

839
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,957
Ten.

840
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,390
Nine.

841
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,158
Eight.

842
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,718
Seven.

843
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,512
Six.

844
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,600
Five.

845
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,870
Four.

846
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,638
Three.

847
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,273
Two apple crumble...

848
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,073
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man,

849
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,873
until this thing is sorted.

850
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,476
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.

851
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,079
What the fuck are you doing here?

852
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,235
What happened?

853
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,680
I don't know what happened.

854
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,872
I don't know what fucking happened.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

855
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,469
Wait. Fuck, it's us.

856
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,511
Aberama's dead, he's gone.

857
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,756
He's gone, and they came for me, too.

858
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,354
What the fuck is she doing here?

859
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,198
Arthur, they got to Barney.

860
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,674
They knew everything.

861
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,473
They knew fucking everything.

862
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,796
Who? Who knew, Tom?

863
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,354
Johnny, get this woman out of here.

864
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,595
- I want to know.
- Yeah.

865
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,711
Get her out of here. Get her out!

866
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,759
Doesn't make sense.

867
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,034
Doesn't make fucking sense.

868
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,957
Who? Who? Who?

869
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,436
The Chinese, the Italians...

870
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,590
...the Branch, Intelligence,
McCavern, Mosley...

871
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,314
Mosley knew nothing!

872
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,510
He knew nothing!

873
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,753
Who?!

874
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,598
Jesus fucking Christ.

875
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,394
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.

876
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,794
Doesn't make sense.

877
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,434
Who?

878
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,875
Who? Who?

879
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,832
Who?

880
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,600
Who? You know, Tom, you must know.

881
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,350
You're fucking scaring me,
what are you doing?

882
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,757
Talk to me.

883
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,317
Maybe I've found him, Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

884
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,031
- Mosley?
- I don't know.

885
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,309
I don't fucking know.

886
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,400
Doesn't make sense.

887
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,270
Let's...

888
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,755
Let's go inside.

889
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,749
We'll work it out...

890
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,831
- ...have a drink.
- I need to walk.

891
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,877
The work is all done, Tommy.

892
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,673
It's all done.

893
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,792
We can walk away from all of this.

894
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,513
It's so easy.

895
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,358
It's so soft.

896
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,437
Such a small change.
