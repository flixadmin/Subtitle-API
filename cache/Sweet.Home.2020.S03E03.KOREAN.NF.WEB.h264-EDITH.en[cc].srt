[Chief Ji]
What was that announcement about?

40
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,314
Does it have anything to do
with locking me up?

41
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,318
We've detected four intruders.

42
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,155
They all seem to be
resisting monsterization.

43
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,244
You said that...

44
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,914
you and your family hid here a year ago

45
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,293
after your son started showing
signs of monsterization.

46
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
When you let all those survivors
inside here,

47
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,092
I'm sure you knew you might wind up
in a situation like this,

48

and here you are.

49
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,096

52
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,480
It was dangerous out there,

53
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,233
and I knew if I didn't let them in here...

54
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,612
every single one of them was gonna die.

55
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,782
Okay. I need you to do one last thing.

The exit out of the unverified area,
show me where it is.

Are you trying to run away?

58

No, I'm not.
I'm only trying to save the survivors.

So you're still alive, huh?

00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,790
Just shut up and answer my questions.

78
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,044
Hang on.
This isn't because of Sang-won, is it?

79
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,754
Do you really have to ask?

80
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,383
Sang-won isn't really dead.

I know that he's dead.

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,579
I get it now. Were you really pregnant?

90
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
I wonder if the kid turned out okay.

91
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,211
The father was a monster.
I'm sure that's left some kind of mark.

92
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,590
That kid can't be normal.

00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,095
I know you killed him
with your own two hands!

104
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,933
How can you say this shit
when you killed him yourself?

105
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,768
I've always been honest with you.

106
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,645
I told you the truth back then.

107
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,272
He wasn't able to talk, remember?

108
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,440
He died.

109
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,569
I know because I saw it with my own eyes.

110
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,130
You can't bring yourself to believe it.

111
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,889
[Dr. Lim] I couldn't if I were you.

112
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,662
But I'm telling you, he really was alive.

113
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,625
And he had a whole new look too.

[menacing music playing]

115

[Dr. Lim] What brings you here?

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,951
[Sang-wook] So this is where you live?

117
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,161
Obviously.

118
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,058
All right, enough with the small talk.

119
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,502
I think it's time that you paid your dues.

120
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,422
[Dr. Lim] Ah...

121
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,009
That's no way to talk
to one of your oldest friends.

122
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,683
[Sang-wook]
You met me and I've kept you alive.

123
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,931
Our friendship's afforded you
some leniency.

124
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,851
I doubt there's anything else
I can do for you at this point.

125
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,896
Actually, there's something
that's been bothering me.

126
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,609
Tell me what it is,
and I'll do whatever I can.

127
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,116
[Dr. Lim] But I gotta ask, Sang-won.

128
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,620
Aren't you curious about Seo Yi-kyung?

129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,580
She's the mother of your child.

130
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,624
I told you, we met up.

131
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,292
[pensive music playing]

132
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,672
Not just once either.
We met several times.

133
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,636
I realized after my memories returned.

134
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,889
Green Home...

135
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,477
Maybe I went there because of her.

136
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,318
<i>I didn't recognize her at the time.</i>

137
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,746
But maybe I wanted to see her.

138
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,165
[dramatic music playing]

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,844
[Dr. Lim] What about now?

140
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,556
I'm just glad that I didn't kill her then...

141
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,018
because now I can meet my child.

142
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,151
[Dr. Lim] If what you're saying is true,
that she survived and gave birth,

143
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,613
then the child
wouldn't even be a year old yet.

144
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,741
There aren't any children that young here.

145
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,246
So what makes you think you'll find them?

146
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,623
[Sang-wook] When I last saw her...

147
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,751
Yi-kyung was already at full term.

148
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,044
[exhales heavily]

149
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,048
[Dr. Lim] So you're telling me
that she got pregnant and gave birth

150
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,633
within a matter of hours?

151
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,677
How is that possible?

152
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,809
This child's the special being
that I created.

153

[menacing music playing]

154
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,817
It will soon reach
the state of absolute perfection.

155
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,994
And I'll use it as my next vessel.

156
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,543
I need you to find a way
for me to leave this body.

I'm Kim Yeong-su.

I don't know.

You don't know it?

166
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,204
What's a name?

167
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,500
What does your mom call you then?

168
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,631
She's never... called me anything.

169
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,884
I'm sure you have a name.

170
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,803
They say that every living thing has one.

171
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,057
Tell me what it is if you find out later.

172
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,309
I'll say it a lot
to make up for lost time.

173

Mm-hmm.

174
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,855
And if you don't have one,
we'll make it up.

175
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,649
Making it up isn't a big deal.

What does he mean by leaving his body?

Sang-won is capable
of taking control of others.

180
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,772
I think his goal is to find
a perfect being and inhabit their body.

181
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,316
And unfortunately, the body he's targeting

is your child's.

Sang-won isn't operating alone.

it wouldn't be easy.

Yes. Now open the door.

He's your own husband.
Even if you find a way,

[Ha-ni breathes shakily]

332
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,020
...you fought as hard as you could
right until the very end...

333
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,567
and ultimately, you won.

334
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,908
I promise to do the same.

335
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,627
[shaky breathing]

336
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,305
Ha-ni.

337
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,982
Take care.

338
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,532
Mm.

339
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,582
I will.

[inhales deeply]

343
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,991
So what's the plan now?

344
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,662
I'll go to the stadium.

345
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,371
What?

346
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,957
Don't worry.

347
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,751
I don't think I'll have to go inside.

348
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,213
I'm pretty sure
Yi-kyung will be there by now.

349
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,509
If we leave right now,
we'll be able to meet her outside.

350
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,052
And you?

351
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,139
The stadium only brings back
bad memories for me.

352
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,644
Hyun-su and Yi-kyung
have lived together this whole time.

353
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,440
I want to join them now.

354
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,027
This feels right.

355
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,739
We should both return
to our rightful places.

356
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,825
[Chan-yeong] And Cha Hyun-su?

357
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,620
He can't go anywhere like this.

358
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,622
[Hyun-su chuckles]

[tense music playing]

Who says we're going anywhere?

361
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,887
You don't need to know where we're going.

362
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,098
Wherever I go, you're coming too.

363
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,194
[tense music continues]

364
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,863
You can't kill me, can you?

365
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,367
You aren't trying to spare me,

366
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,161
but you just can't kill me.

367
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,037
What?

368
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,707
[Eun-yu]
I'm sure you're just as confused as I am.

369
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,102
You thought you could do
whatever you wanted,

370
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,461
but turns out you can't.

371
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,796
Am I wrong?

372
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
Stop it.

373
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,675
[Eun-yu] Cha Hyun-su.

374
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,553
Come with me now.

375
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,848
You've got nothing better to do.

376
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,940
Hyun-su, please come with me.

377
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,614
It's funny.

378
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,161
I've woken up exactly three times,

379
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,999
and each time,
you were right there in front of me.

380
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,916
Cha Hyun-su.

381
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,136
Why didn't you ever run away?

382
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,054
Because I was waiting for you.

383
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,891
You would? For me?

384
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,268
Or was it Cha Hyun-su?

385
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,732
All right, how about this?

386
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,235
I'll try to keep Cha Hyun-su
from taking over

387
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,988
while you try to bring him back.

388
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,198
I'll give you three days.

389
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,868
And if you win,

390
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,621
I'll let him come back.

391
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,332
Do you mean that?

392
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,587
I guess we'll find out.

393
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,843
So wherever it is
that you're planning on going...

394
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,387
let's go, I'll tag along.

395
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,614
[Hyun-su] What the hell is this?

396
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,324
- Carry it.
- Why should I?

397
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,533
You agreed to come.

398
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,613
We're gonna help each other.

399
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,250
You guys are coming with us?

400

[grunts]
That's great.

401

It's no fun being a lone ranger.

I know from experience.

00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,834
We finally meet.

407
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,213
Hmm...

408
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,673
I should introduce myself.

409
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,216
I am...

410
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,552
your father.

411
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,847
Father?

[tense music playing]

413
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,267
What does that mean?

414
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,227
It means I'm the one who created you.

415
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,908
[Sang-wook] Didn't your mom tell you that?

416
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,902
Sounds like I have a lot to teach you.

417
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,157
We'll be living here for a while.

418
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,159
This place will be...

419
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,244
your playground.

420
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,497
If there's anything you want to do,
you're free to do it.

421
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
Anything?

422
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,710
Of course, anything.

423
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,545
By the way,

424
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,298
why are you all alone?

425
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,175
Where's your mom?

426
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,186
Is she dead?

427
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,938
She's a monster now.

428
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,863
You've been through a lot.

429
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,157
But from now on,

430
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,534
I'm gonna take good care of you

[Chi-seong] It appears that...

435
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,818
someone's escaped from Bamseom.

436
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,988
Well, she said she'd do it.

437
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,282
But she really made a mess of it.

438
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,451
I... I should've kept tabs on her.

439
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
Station her at the main gate.

440
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,676
If those soldiers return...

441
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,595
kill them yourself.

442
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,518
This time, you'll do in front of everyone.

[engine starts]

444

Keep tailing him and don't get caught.

445
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,263
I know I shouldn't be, but I'm concerned.

00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,472
Why are you concerned?

447
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,143
He found his child, so now
he just needs to take over her body.

448
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,437
We can't afford any hiccups
while we move forward.

449
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,981
We're still not sure
if that child's potential.

450
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,275
Just tail them from far away.

451
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,109
Okay.

452
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,488
[chuckles]

What a pretty child.

Don't make me kill you.

457
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,813
Go back inside now.

458

Honey, don't do anything you'll regret.

459

There isn't even time to do
the things we truly want.

That's why I'm getting out of here.

Why are you doing this?

464

[groans]
Why are you... Hey!

465
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,088
Honey, please let me go.

00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,547
Sweetheart, let me go.

00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,300
That hurts! Ah!

468
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,306
Why are you so pouty?

469
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,935
Is it because of that girl?

470
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,897
It was Mr. Sang-wook, wasn't it?

471
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,111
Is he really her dad?

472
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,991
Does this mean she's leaving now?

473
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,496
I guess it does.

474
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,873
I don't like it.

475
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,057
[Peter] You said you were like sisters.

476
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,143
Take good care of her.

477
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,437
She just tried to escape.

478
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
What?

479
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,318
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

480
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,862
I thought we could go home
if the gate up there was opened.

That's what Jin-ok said, isn't it?

Are you scared?

00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,073
Is that why you won't come in?

[Ye-seul] No.

about whether I kill you or not.

to get my blood all over your hands?

this would be too easy.

498
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,525
[Chief Ji] Just think it over.

499
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
You'll figure it out.

500
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,823
What the most...

501
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,035
painful death will be for me.

502
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,340
[tense music continues]

503
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,636
I'm only asking for a few words.

504
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,599
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
I was mistaken."

505
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,185
I'm not asking that much!

506
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,648
[Ye-seul breathing heavily]

507
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,793
I don't intend on begging for forgiveness.

508
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,943
[shouts]
Why?

509
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,488
Because I can't.

510
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,286
I can't forgive myself either.

00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,782
[Ye-seul sniffles]

514
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,915
She said this was her response
to your proposal.

515
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,762
[Jin-ho] What is all this?

516
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,243
[Dong-jun] It's a map of the stadium.

517
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,809
It shows everything,
including the unverified area.

[tense music continues]

519
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,692
That woman was no coward.

520
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,696
She wanted to take responsibility
until the very end.

521
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,832

Where's Hyun-su?

529
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,348
I thought he went after you.

530
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,932
You didn't see him?

531
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,642
No.

532
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,816
He'll be back.

533
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,326
He has no reason to run off on his own.

534
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,745
Why don't you sit down and eat something?

535
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,747
We've got a long way to go.

His haircut's just as lame
as his personality.

539
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,817
Seriously?

540
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,821
You guys are eating without me?

541
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,114
Did you want to eat?

542
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,325
Obviously. You aren't gonna share?

543

[sniffles]

548
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,239
So you're off the drugs?

549
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,784
If you're not gonna commit to it,
then just...

550
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,869
[breathes deeply]

551
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,830
Just take a hint
and stop torturing yourself.

552
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,623
[sighs]
You crazy bitch.

553

[sighs]

00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,796
Hey, where are you going?

555
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,632
Sober or not,
I'm gonna find some herbs to help you.

556
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,677
Do you even know what you're looking for?

557
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,221
[Eun-yu] I'll pick some random leaves.
Something will work.

558
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,932
Wait here. I'll be right back.

559
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,892
[Ha-ni sighs]

560
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,201
Uh... can I ask you a question?

561
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,373
Were you the one who...

562
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
killed Mr. Kim?

563
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,295
I don't know who that is.

564
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,922
That day you saved Eun-yu.

565
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,260
You think this idiot only saved her
once or twice?

566
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,931
He doesn't kill people.

567
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,476
Haven't you figured that out?

568
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,732
Oh.

569
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,517
- [heavy breathing]
- [Hyun-su] <i>That perverted asshole?</i>

570
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,406
<i>Cha Hyun-su was furious back then.</i>

571
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,701
<i>It's a good thing he's already a monster.</i>

572
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,414
<i>Otherwise, he would've killed them,
and then cried about it for days.</i>

573
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,709
Ah.

574
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,629
He was symptomatic then.

575
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,259
So...

576
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,137
do you like her?

577
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,804
What?

578
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,724
Cha Hyun-su likes her.

579
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,102
That's why he's always
hovering around her.

580
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,856
That wuss doesn't have the balls
to do anything about it.

581
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,651
What about you?

[Ha-ni breathes heavily, grunts]

[Sang-wook] What are you thinking about?

588
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,207
Aren't you afraid of...

589
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,835
what I might say?

590
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:00,919
Not at all.

591
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,089
Oh, okay.

592
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,344
Mom was always afraid
because we were different.

593
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,473
What about you, Dad?

594
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,268
Will you accept me?

595
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,188
Of course.

596
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,319
That's what makes you so pretty though.

597

[Sang-wook] You said
monsters don't hurt you, right?

Let me see how you do.

And if you do well...

600
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,018
I'll make sure
you'll never get hurt again.

601
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,020
And I'll give you a present.

A present?

603
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,942
I'll give you anything you want.

604

Just tell me what it is.
