1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:04,252
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,036
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:08,522
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:10,741
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,443
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,029
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:18,282
But to the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,833
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,452
I am something else.

10
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,037
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,455
Hello, Sara.

12
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:27,291
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:33,013
Whoever did this,
I'm going to find them.

14
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,214
Apparently there's
another bidder for the company.

15
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,465
Who?

16
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,750
Ray Palmer.

17
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,386
Yes, I am your boss now.

18
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:41,638
No!

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,808
Roy, I don't
trust you, or anyone.

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,278
Don't try to find me.
I am never coming back.

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,780
Now I've got
to go get Thea.

22
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,982
It's long past time
she came home.

23
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,036
Well done.

24
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,642
Thanks, Dad.

25
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:21,528
So, where are we going?

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,829
Wherever you want.

27
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,503
It's up to me?
Why not?

28
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,564
I'm a well-traveled man.

29
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,709
I've been every place
in the world there is.

30
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,904
But you want
to get out of here.

31
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,274
Because if the police know
you're alive, they come after you.

32
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:36,610
The Arrow, too.

33
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:40,180
You're very
perceptive, Thea.

34
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:43,166
Knowing when people are hiding
something behind their smiles.

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,085
Your mother
had that talent.

36
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:47,337
Yes.

37
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:49,589
If someone knew
where I was,

38
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,908
it would be
unfortunate--

39
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,677
for both of us.

40
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,882
So why did you
reach out to me?

41
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,283
You reached first.

42
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,052
Still.

43
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:06,139
I don't want to feel
this pain again.

44
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,308
I don't want to hurt

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,277
or get hurt

46
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:13,280
ever again.

47
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:17,367
And you seem like someone
who can teach me how not to.

48
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,901
I didn't do it!

49
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,652
A woman was killed
on a rooftop last week.

50
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,571
Black leather,
blonde hair, wore a mask!

51
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,323
I didn't kill her.
You were there!

52
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,074
I don't know
anything about it!

53
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,076
Your fingerprints
are on this.

54
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,528
From a fifth I drank
up there, but I--

55
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,029
What did you see?

56
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,581
Nothing!

57
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,366
I was up on the roof
with some buddies.

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,868
This lady,
she showed up

59
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,619
and she--
she told us to go!

60
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,621
Looked like she could handle
herself, you know?

61
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,425
Whoever it is
you're looking for,

62
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,877
I wouldn't want
to be him.

63
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:21,381
Another dead end.

64
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:24,434
It took me a week to get
a hit off that print.

65
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,936
I had to reconstruct
the partial

66
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,721
using a predictive
indexing algorithm.

67
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,640
Appropriate, since it was
his index finger...

68
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,894
Not particularly
relevant now.

69
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:38,565
Don't worry, Oliver, we'll find him.
He's out there somewhere.

70
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,066
No, he's not.

71
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,235
Trail's gone cold.

72
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,821
I hate to do this, but I have to
head off to work.

73
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,313
Tech Village
is open this early?

74
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:47,665
Not exactly.

75
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,337
Have you figured out
where in Italy Thea's staying?

76
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,078
Yeah, about that--
she's not in Italy.

77
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:51,662
Hmm?

78
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:54,748
Or Europe.
Or, well, she's--

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,216
Where is she?

80
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,634
I had to ping her cell phone
to find out

81
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,053
where in Italy she
was texting from.

82
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:04,174
Turns out, came back
Corto Maltese.

83
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,892
Corto's an island
off of South America.

84
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,094
What's up with your family
and islands?

85
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:11,097
Wait, Oliver.

86
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,067
Thea's letter said
not to come find her.

87
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,270
That letter was addressed
to you, not to me.

88
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:21,908
I'm watching Laurel
go through losing Sara.

89
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:26,279
It's time for my sister
to come home.

90
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,119
What are you doing?

91
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,955
Thea's gone because of me.

92
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,590
Because the lies
that I told her.

93
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,425
So I owe this to both
of you to make things right.

94
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:41,428
No. What are
you...doing?

95
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,331
You can't travel
with that.

96
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:49,719
I've actually never
been on a plane before.

97
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,476
I know. You're not
doing anything

98
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,445
and I could literally
watch you forever.

99
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,230
Oh, yeah?

100
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:03,033
What about once
she discovers boys?

101
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,286
Well, that's what my Glock
is for, right, baby?

102
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,455
Right. It's my Glock.

103
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,966
I'm going to enjoy some quality time
with her for the next few days.

104
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:22,669
I'm even looking forward
to changing a few diapers.

105
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,889
And I'm looking forward to believing
that when I see it.

106
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,893
Why the time off?

107
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,845
You quit
the team again?

108
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,347
No, Oliver's going
to Corto Maltese

109
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,017
for a couple of days.

110
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,853
Could you
go with him?

111
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:43,073
Like I don't already spend
enough time with Oliver as it is?

112
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,109
Team Arrow may have Starling City
purring like a kitten,

113
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,863
but the rest of the world is still
a very dangerous place.

114
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:52,365
Including Corto Maltese.

115
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,167
Lyla, I already don't like
where this is headed.

116
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,169
We have a field operative
down there who's gone dark.

117
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,705
All right, so send an agent.
Send a task force.

118
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:00,507
He's not in any
kind of trouble.

119
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,542
He hasn't touched
his panic button.

120
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:05,178
He's probably just drunk
in some belleza's villa.

121
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,131
Mark Shaw's been known
to miss a few days from time to time.

122
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,053
Will you just
do me a favor...

123
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,721
And see if he's ok?

124
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,489
Tell him to check in.

125
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,308
Two more days and I'm going to have
to call in the cavalry.

126
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,360
And I don't want to get him into
trouble with Waller.

127
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,363
Mark's an old friend.

128
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:29,402
She better not do anything interesting
while I'm gone.

129
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:42,215
Next time,
keep your hands up.

130
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,089
Ted Grant?

131
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,640
Well, I guess that badge means
you're not here

132
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,142
for a self defense
class.

133
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,810
No, I've already had
my fair share.

134
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,012
I'm here about one
of your students, Tom Bronson.

135
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,263
A witness places him
at the scene

136
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:58,802
of a break-in last night.

137
00:06:58,802 --> 00:06:59,853
Well, that's not possible.

138
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,021
See, because Tom and I
were sparring last night.

139
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,354
Mr. Grant, do you
know that lying

140
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,689
to the district
attorney

141
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,157
is against the law?

142
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,109
If by that, you mean
am I willing to lie

143
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,494
in order to keep a good kid who
just happened to make a stupid mistake

144
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:14,364
out of this system?
I think you know my answer.

145
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:18,368
Are you admitting
to perjury, Mr. Grant?

146
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,087
Now that's a big word.

147
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,123
I'm just a dumb fighter.

148
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,874
Right?

149
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,860
Look, Tom was here
with me last night.

150
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,678
We worked on his
uppercut combinations.

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,947
Like I said, in this city,
there's a lot of good people

152
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,766
who get dealt bad hands.

153
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,768
They lose someone, they lose themselves,
which is why they

154
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,803
come in here
to work off that rage.

155
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,055
I've gotten good
at picking out the types.

156
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,890
Types just like you.

157
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,193
If I'm angry,
it's because I'm dealing

158
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,444
with someone who's
willing to lie to a D.A.

159
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,062
to protect a punk kid.

160
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,731
I don't think
that's the case.

161
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,317
Either way,

162
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,120
if you do have something
you want to work off...

163
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,725
So what's the play
with Thea?

164
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,094
Do you mind if I talk
to her alone first?

165
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,346
It's been a while.

166
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:21,815
Felicity able
to pin her down?

167
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:24,567
She gave me an address.

168
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,285
Thea!

169
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,589
Señor.

170
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,924
Cómo puedo ayudarlo?

171
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,709
Estoy buscando
a mi hermana.

172
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,295
You must be Mia's brother.

173
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,047
I see the resemblance.

174
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:55,632
Is "Mia" around?

175
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,017
She works. At the cafe.

176
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,102
Where's the cafe?

177
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,221
I'll show you.
Thank you.

178
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,983
I didn't come all the way
to South America

179
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,902
to have you poison me, did I?

180
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:20,073
It's a meditative tea.

181
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:23,793
It will activate
your mind and body.

182
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:26,880
I think I'm going to need
a little bit more than tea

183
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:29,299
to learn how
to use one of those.

184
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:32,585
The Sohei Buddhist
warriors believed that

185
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,171
first you fight
with the mind...

186
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,507
then your sword.

187
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,928
I remember when
I was training

188
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,479
to be a warrior.

189
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,981
I began
just like you--

190
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,233
devastated
by my wife's death.

191
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,602
I was...angry,

192
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,771
and hurt.

193
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,526
The pain
was unbearable.

194
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,537
Like this.

195
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,292
You're out of your mind!
Put your hand in here!

196
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:15,762
Every warrior must learn
the simple truth--

197
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:17,513
that pain
is inevitable,

198
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,383
and suffering
is optional.

199
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,720
Please, don't--

200
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:24,971
Don't do what I think
you're going to do!

201
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,807
You asked me
to teach you.

202
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,800
No.

203
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:34,801

206
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:49,042
Thea.

207
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,715
Good to see you.

208
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,133
You, too.

209
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,601
How--how did you--

210
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:01,805
Well, it's not exactly
the Amalfi Coast.

211
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,692
Voy a cerrar, earnesto.

212
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:07,777
Didn't you flunk
Spanish?

213
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,563
More like
skipped it altogether.

214
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,882
Well, you look good.

215
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:15,251
I like
your hair cut.

216
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:18,488
Thank you. Yeah,
wanted it short, you know.

217
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,156
It gets hot down here.

218
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm sorry I lied to you

219
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:25,662
about it, Ollie.

220
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,665
I just needed some space.

221
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,801
It's ok. You've had
five months of it.

222
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:35,505
This isn't just a visit.

223
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,345
Got one
for you, too.

224
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,247
After mom,

225
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,100
I understood why
you left Starling.

226
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:50,487
But Thea,

227
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,105
I miss you.

228
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,528
And I would really like it
if you came home.

229
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,164
I miss you, too.

230
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,084
And I love you...so much.

231
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:08,838
But I'm never coming back
to Starling City.

232
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,299
Ahh!

233
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:23,219
I can't. Sorry.

234
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:24,888
There is strength
in you, Thea.

235
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,807
I see it, even if you can't
see it yourself.

236
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,976
I'm sorry, this--

237
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:34,481
this just isn't me.
I'm not like you. I can't do this!

238
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:37,700
It's all right.

239
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:41,070
It's not your fault.

240
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:43,456
It's mine.

241
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,410
Q.C. stock up 10 bucks
at the open.

242
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:49,128
That is love, ha!

243
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,831
Ah, miss Smoak,
good morning--

244
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,750
I think. I've been
here all night.

245
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,718
My predecessor left
things a little, um,

246
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,171
what's the polite way
to say this? Little wonky.

247
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:00,223
Sorry if I'm rambling.
I'm a little over-caffeinated.

248
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,975
I just had
three espressos.

249
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,476
Speaking of coffee--
Let me stop you right there!

250
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,562
I told myself
that I would stand firm

251
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:06,524
on a few points.

252
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,647
No late night emails,
no personal errands,

253
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:11,484
and definitely no coffee.

254
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,070
There'll be no espressos
brought to you by me.

255
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,440
I stand very firm
on that last point.

256
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:21,110
And I admire
your conviction.

257
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,580
This is Jerry Conway,
your executive assistant.

258
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:27,116
And I wanted to know
if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

259
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,202
Or are you just
anti-latte in general?

260
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:32,338
Um...Executive assistant?

261
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,092
I think that's
a yes on the latte.

262
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,094
Thank you, Jerry.

263
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,345
Thank you, Jerry.

264
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,763
Should we get to
work? Excellent.

265
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,382
Applied Sciences.

266
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,050
Q.C.'s bleeding edge
research division,

267
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,351
till some wacko
blew it up last year.

268
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,637
I'm sure they had
their reasons.

269
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,906
The point is, it's the cornerstone
for my plan

270
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,540
to rebuild
Queen Consolidated

271
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,943
and thus the city.
I've had my people

272
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,645
working day and night
salvaging what they can,

273
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,480
including this--
a file server

274
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:59,866
containing Applied
Science's design work.

275
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:01,451
It's not working,
unfortunately,

276
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,236
on account of being caught
in a massive explosion.

277
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,204
You want me to access the data.

278
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,990
A brilliant mind
at work already.

279
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,425
Speaking of, I got
to get back to work.

280
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:12,378
Then why are you
leaving your office?

281
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,964
Oh, I'm not.
I'm leaving yours.

282
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,312
This is Lyla's busy work, man
you didn't have to tag along.

283
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:32,682
Well, I don't know how to vacation
like a normal person, Diggle.

284
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,900
What's the plan?

285
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:35,401
This spot's his
usual dead drop.

286
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:37,737
Lyla sent me over
this file photo.

287
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,355
Just make sure
he's all right.

288
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,861
Got him.
I got you.

289
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,797
He's a friendly,
Oliver.

290
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,502
Shaw.

291
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:56,005
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

292
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,757
Listen! I'm with
Lyla Michaels.

293
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,959
Have you seen any
capuchins today?

294
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,844
If that's a challenge code, I got
to tell you, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.

295
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:03,379
I'm just Lyla's
baby daddy.

296
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,131
Now, you didn't check in, Shaw.
She was worried,

297
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,966
so she sent me
to find you.

298
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,885
If you're lyin', you'll be picking
your intestines up

299
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,353
off this sidewalk.

300
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,722
That's fair enough.

301
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,945
Lyla gave me a security
transcoder in my right jacket pocket.

302
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:29,372
Pretty jumpy, Shaw.

303
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,458
Better jumpy than dead.

304
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,160
Copy that.
What's going on?

305
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,546
Not here.

306
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:41,250
Sorry, I had--

307
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:42,835
I had eyes on me
all week,

308
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:44,337
a whole
follow team.

309
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,056
Wait, Shaw. What makes
you so important?

310
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:48,591
I have hard Intel.

311
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:51,059
Someone from Corto Maltese
hacked into the server

312
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:52,595
and acquired
the A.R.G.U.S. actual.

313
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,013
They want to sell it.

314
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:55,481
Did I mention I don't
work for A.R.G.U.S.?

315
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,567
The actual is an encrypted
data omnibus.

316
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,152
It's a complete record
of agent covers,

317
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:01,604
personal details,
affiliated soft targets--

318
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:05,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa, soft targets...
As in family members?

319
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:08,027
Yeah, as in women
and children.

320
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,914
You get why
this is so important?

321
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:14,425
Hi, my name is Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

322
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,093
Hi, Laurel.

323
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,346
A week ago, I...

324
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,399
Something happened.

325
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:25,936
Something that
I can't share with anyone

326
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:30,107
for several
complicated reasons.

327
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,613
I thought that I was going
to want to drink...

328
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,832
But I didn't.

329
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,417
Not even tempted,
really.

330
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:45,806
But what I am is...

331
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,876
Is I'm angry.

332
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:51,011
And I don't know
what to do with it

333
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:54,531
or--or where to put
it. I just...

334
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:02,973
Thank you for
letting me share.

335
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,144
Are there any other
burning desires?

336
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:13,083
Erica. Alcoholic.

337
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:14,234
Hi, Erica.

338
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:16,036
My boyfriend and me

339
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,638
got into another
fight last night.

340
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,991
Some of you know,
he still drinks, a lot.

341
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:23,160
And I said something.

342
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:28,215
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

343
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:33,687
I know I should
just leave him, but...I can't.

344
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,139
Maybe there's a meeting

345
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,807
I should be
going to for that.

346
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,010
Once a month, Erica
gives a share like that

347
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,595
- and it's getting worse.
- Yeah.

348
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,063
Do you know
the boyfriend has

349
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:44,431
eight assault charges
against him?

350
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,766
And not just
in Starling.

351
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:46,984
He's got warrants
out on him

352
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,569
as far off
as Coast City.

353
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:50,070
And it takes everything in me
not to go after

354
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,655
a dirtbag like that,
but the day the cops

355
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,574
start bringing their badges
into AA meetings,

356
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:56,493
that's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

357
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,034
I'm in position.

358
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,537
The sale of the actual
is going down here.

359
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,340
Only two of us. You didn't want
to call for back up?

360
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,543
Hey.

361
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,795
That's the only insurance
policy you're going to need.

362
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,217
They're here.

363
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,523
You're not worried about them
seeing our ride?

364
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,160
How did you know
the buy was happening?

365
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:34,363
I've been a station agent
in Corto Maltese for three years now.

366
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,034
I got this third-world
garbage dump wired.

367
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,571
What's wrong?

368
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:45,742
There's no buy,
is there, Shaw?

369
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,897
Sorry for lyin' to you,
John. Well, partially lyin'.

370
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:09,683
There is a buy going down,
just not till tomorrow.

371
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,602
I needed to get this first.

372
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:14,905
Thanks for helping me
decode the actual.

373
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,274
Diggle!

374
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:42,180
Should have got
the heavy duty ones.

375
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,331
I like your hair.

376
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,935
What are you and my brother
like travel buddies now?

377
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,693
No, we're just
worried about you.

378
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:57,116
Oliver said you weren't
going to come back, so...

379
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:00,302
I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you to.

380
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,637
Well, you can't.

381
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,005
Look, I get it, you're hurt.

382
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:05,174
I lied to you,
I lied right to your face.

383
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:06,937
But I--I need you to know
that when I said

384
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,678
I wanted to leave
Starling with you,

385
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,262
that wasn't a lie.

386
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:13,549
I didn't just leave
because of you, Roy.

387
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,719
My mother lied to me,

388
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,221
my brother.

389
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:22,808
I had to get away from Starling City
and all the secrets.

390
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,811
And I found
myself here.

391
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,564
Isn't it lonely here?

392
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,233
That's kind of what
I like about it.

393
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,153
There's no one here
who knows me

394
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:37,655
or thinks of me
as Thea Queen

395
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,975
or Thea Merlyn.

396
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:44,380
No one who lies
to me, or...

397
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:47,750
tries to protect me
with secrets.

398
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:50,469
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

399
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,055
I'm sorry I got
in the way of that.

400
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,424
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

401
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:58,394
If being here instead of home
makes you happy, then--

402
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,729
then you should stay.

403
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:06,735
Roy?

404
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,539
Are you ok?

405
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,442
You look
a little tired.

406
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:16,195
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.

407
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,948
You take care.

408
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,131
What do you mean?

409
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,134
It's not your fault,
it's mine.

410
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,938
I thought I could
do this differently,

411
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,273
but I can't.

412
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:47,109
I need to train you
as I was trained.

413
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,812
Treat you
as my student,

414
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:52,281
not my daughter.

415
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,620
What are you doing?!

416
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,624
The only way to forge steel is to
temper it with fire.

417
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:07,296
Stay away from me,
you sick son of a bitch!

418
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,666
Now we can begin.

419
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:15,254
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I could have helped.

420
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:16,555
I didn't want you
to worry, Lyla.

421
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:17,890
Besides, I thought
we could handle it.

422
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:19,308
Well, we've hacked
his email traffic.

423
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,664
He's got a buyer en route
to Corto Maltese.

424
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,267
Who?

425
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,055
The tech boys
are still working on that.

426
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:25,681
But Waller's dispatched
a wet team to your position.

427
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:27,183
They're not going
to get here in time.

428
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,852
They might.
Keep your powder dry.

429
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:31,621
Copy that.

430
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,491
We're not going to
keep our powder dry.

431
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,827
Hell no.

432
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:43,065
Hey.

433
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,601
Any luck raising our digital Lazarus
from the dead?

434
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:47,437
The hard drive
is toast.

435
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,038
And the power
supply.

436
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,374
And...the actuator.

437
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,975
Ah, I'm sensing
a pattern.

438
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:57,180
Sorry, one second.

439
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:59,282
Hello?

440
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:01,350
Hey, Felicity, this is John.
Where are you?

441
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:03,686
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

442
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,438
Are you near a computer?
Kind of.

443
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,389
I'm looking for somebody
in Corto Maltese.

444
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,392
I'm actually a little bit
in the middle of a...

445
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:10,476
I need to know where he is.

446
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:11,994
I've emailed you
everything I have on him.

447
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,813
...meeting right now.

448
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,232
I am so sorry.
It's a friend.

449
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,618
Um, well,
a few friends...

450
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,787
Actually. You know what,
it's a long story.

451
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,740
Heh. Why am I under the impression
that you have a lot of stories,

452
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:27,410
all of which are long?

453
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:28,411
You want me
to come back later?

454
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:30,246
What? Sorry.

455
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:31,998
Hello?

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,249
Felicity, I need a favor.

457
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,501
Are we favor
friends now?

458
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:37,670
Are we friends?
What?

459
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:39,455
Never mind, sorry.

460
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:42,091
Oh, dear god. One second.
One more second. Hello?

461
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,342
We got cut off.

462
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:44,660
According to the file
you sent me,

463
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,712
this guy is somewhat
of a hacker.

464
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:48,898
Let me guess--long story?

465
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,050
Yeah, the guy I'm looking for broke
into A.R.G.U.S's system.

466
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,935
And he left a trail.
It's faint--hacking-wise--

467
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:55,688
but with a little bit
of luck, I will find him,

468
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,941
or his laptop. I will email
you when I have something.

469
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:01,577
I'm having
a bit of a day.

470
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,113
I need you to help me find someone
by googling his phone or something.

471
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,082
Pinging his GPS.

472
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,951
Can I call you back?

473
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,087
Is this what a typical day
looks like for you?

474
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:14,724
Believe it or not, this is
better than most.

475
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:17,210
When Felicity has Shaw's location,
I want you to text me and I'll be there.

476
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,762
Thea?
Yeah.

477
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,264
Oliver, I don't
think she's going

478
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,965
to change her mind on this.
She doesn't want

479
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,217
to hear from anyone,
and I don't blame her.

480
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:26,769
I mean, we both
lied to her. A lot.

481
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,771
I know, it's why it's time
to tell her the truth.

482
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:30,389
Oliver, when you say
"the truth"...

483
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,225
What happened
the five years I was away,

484
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:33,776
everything we've done since
I've been back,

485
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:35,861
all of it.

486
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,396
Well, you might want
to think about that for a second.

487
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:38,781
Lies are what drove Thea
away from Starling City

488
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,616
in the first place.

489
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,985
The truth is the only thing
that's going to bring her back.

490
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:45,121
Except you won't be
telling her the truth, will you?

491
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:47,957
You'll be telling her that her brother
has been lying to her to her face,

492
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,326
with almost
pathological sincerity

493
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:51,711
for the past two years.

494
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:53,996
She won't believe
another word you say.

495
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,165
And you will lose her,
Oliver, forever.

496
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:59,719
Well, look around.

497
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,054
I've already
lost her.

498
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:04,640
I don't have
any other choice.

499
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,610
I hear you like
to hit women.

500
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:26,779
How about one
who likes to hit back?

501
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:37,707
You're right.
It's better when they hit back.

502
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:00,844
Baby, baby,
are you ok?

503
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:03,363
I'm so sorry.

504
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:06,382
I'm too relieved to be mad at you,
I really am.

505
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:10,804
But, sweetheart...

506
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:13,039
This is crazy.

507
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,374
What the hell
were you thinking

508
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:16,543
going after that
girl's boyfriend?

509
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:19,362
There's just something
I needed to work out.

510
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:22,449
I know that the world
isn't fair.

511
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:26,236
I know that it's
a terrible place where...

512
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:29,405
where people deserve
to get punished.

513
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:32,659
And they don't. I just...

514
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,915
For one night,

515
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,967
I needed the world
to be different.

516
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:44,571
Ok, Laurel,
Laurel...

517
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,389
What's going on
with you, huh?

518
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:47,924
You're not being
yourself lately.

519
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,509
And now you're
running around,

520
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:53,096
you're tuning this guy up.
What are you doin'?!

521
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,148
Baby, you can talk to me
about anything.

522
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,183
You know that,
right? You know that.

523
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,769
I know.

524
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:05,825
Talk to me, then.

525
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,757
Laurel, you're not
the arrow.

526
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,126
Or your sister.

527
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:28,798
You promise me you'll never
do anything like this again, ever!

528
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,968
I promise.

529
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,939
It was a mistake;
I wasn't thinking.

530
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,735
If you want to stay
in Corto Maltese, it's fine,

531
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,788
but there's not much
here in the way of sightseeing.

532
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,406
I need to talk to you.

533
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,858
Look, between you
and your new best friend Roy,

534
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm pretty sure you guys have
said everything.

535
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:59,946
I haven't.

536
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,231
Not yet, anyway.

537
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:08,704
Roy showed me
the note you left him.

538
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,790
And you were right
about everything.

539
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:13,826
I have lied,
I have kept secrets.

540
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:16,379
The truth is that

541
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,497
if I tell you...

542
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,167
All the things that you don't
know about me,

543
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:24,503
that I might
lose you forever.

544
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,890
I spent five years
in the worst kind of hell,

545
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:30,843
and there were
things that happened,

546
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:35,765
there were things
that I did...

547
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,483
That if--

548
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,685
if you knew,

549
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,771
you would see me
differently.

550
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:45,491
No, I'll always
see you as my big brother.

551
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:47,910
I mean, no matter
what happened

552
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:51,998
to you on that island,
or who you became,

553
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,669
it's the secrets you kept
about my own life.

554
00:28:58,623 --> 00:29:01,791
I mean, you lied to me

555
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:04,794
about who my father was.

556
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:12,351
Malcolm may have
been your blood.

557
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:15,054
Robert was
your father.

558
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:21,811
I lied to you
about him, too.

559
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:25,064
Dad wasn't the man
we thought he was.

560
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:27,950
He was better.

561
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:31,787
And I've kept something from you
because I just...

562
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:37,043
Never wanted you
to know.

563
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,381
Dad made it off
"The Gambit" with me.

564
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,584
You told me he drowned.

565
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:49,171
We made it to
a life boat together.

566
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:52,425
There wasn't enough
food and water for both of us...

567
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:56,729
So he killed
himself.

568
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:03,436
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now

569
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:06,739
because I need you
to realize...

570
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:10,076
mom and dad,

571
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:12,912
they sacrificed
themselves

572
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:15,448
so that
we could live.

573
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,201
But if we're not
together, then...

574
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:21,687
we're not even
really alive.

575
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,373
You're my family.

576
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,043
And even if you
don't need me...

577
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,963
I need you.

578
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:36,769
Please just consider
what I'm saying.

579
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:51,617
He's here.

580
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,285
So's his buyer.

581
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,830
I was expecting
Armitage.

582
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:08,050
This country's soil
is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.

583
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:09,885
Do you have the item?

584
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:13,205
Where's the money?

585
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,678
And the transcoder?

586
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:33,459
We better go.

587
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:43,836
Where'd you get this?

588
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,340
Our hotel room.

589
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,215
Who are they?

590
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:58,250
Could be A.R.G.U.S.

591
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:02,188
That's not A.R.G.U.S.

592
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,532
Suelten sus armas!
Let's go.

593
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:17,643
Go!

594
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:28,920
A.R.G.U.S., they
know we're here.

595
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:31,039
Which is why I got a bunch
of renta-soldiers to secure the perimeter.

596
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,757
It's amazing how cheap
you can buy an army

597
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,409
for in this country.

598
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,936
Diggle!
Behind you!

599
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:54,813
I never said I didn't know
how to use a gun.

600
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,176
Lyla was your friend!

601
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,461
And you endangered
her and her daughter

602
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,630
for what, for a lousy payday!

603
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:04,849
Not a payday.
It's my ticket out.

604
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,468
Of what?
A.R.G.U.S.!

605
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,271
You don't know the things Waller's
made me do.

606
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:13,107
The person
she turns you into.

607
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:14,809
That still gives you no right

608
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:17,362
to put a bulls-eye
on my family's back!

609
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:19,197
I had no choice.

610
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,482
But you do, John.

611
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,885
Tell Waller I died.

612
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,954
Tell her you put
a bullet in me.

613
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:32,260
If only.

614
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:34,028
I've been thinking.

615
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,882
I want to go home.
To my brother.

616
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:39,751
And all his lies
and secrets?

617
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,003
Maybe you haven't come
as far as I thought.

618
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:44,038
Let me prove it to you.

619
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:08,913
Impressive.

620
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:14,285
I had a good teacher.

621
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:24,095
Looks like
you're going home.

622
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:36,391
You let me win,
didn't you?

623
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,943
I'll be seeing you soon.

624
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,979
Safe flight.

625
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:53,991
Thank you.
Yeah.

626
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:59,796
You ok?

627
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,718
She's not coming.

628
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,724
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything you could, man.

629
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:15,162
Oliver...

630
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:26,106
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

631
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:29,576
Still not sure about flying
commercial, though.

632
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,579
Oh!

633
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:38,702
Thea,
are you ok?

634
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:41,588
Yeah. I'm fine.

635
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,619
Laurel?

636
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,741
I didn't know the Arrow
took vacations.

637
00:36:57,743 --> 00:36:59,759
Hey! What happened?

638
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,228
I'm fine. Please.

639
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,847
What happened?

640
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:06,733
I tried to do good.

641
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,685
It didn't work out.

642
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,070
Oh, Laurel.

643
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:13,907
I know that
it probably sounds insane.

644
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,077
It probably is, but...

645
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:20,447
Sara.

646
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:22,999
She gave me this.

647
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,284
And when I wear it,
it makes me want

648
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:27,170
to help people
like she did.

649
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,206
Like she's alive again.

650
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,208
I get it.

651
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:35,629
Sara had training.

652
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,264
She had years--

653
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:40,433
Oliver, I know.

654
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:43,220
Which is why
I need to start,

655
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,472
and I need
your help.

656
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,062
No.

657
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,648
Oliver!

658
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,949
No!

659
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:58,285
No.

660
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:00,620
I...

661
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,875
I want you
to consider

662
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:09,212
what would happen
to your father

663
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:11,831
if something
happened to you.

664
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,718
Oliver, ever sense
it happened,

665
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I have had this fire
inside of me

666
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:20,090
that I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

667
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,725
I need another way!

668
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,978
And the other night,
even though it went wrong

669
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,680
it was the first time
since Sara died

670
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,531
where I haven't felt that fire.

671
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:31,167
I'm sorry,
but I can't.

672
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:35,522
And even if I could,

673
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:38,658
Sara would never
forgive me.

674
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:58,928
Yeah.

675
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,302
Hey.

676
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,554
Love you.
I love you both.

677
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:09,806
The two of you
were all I could think about.

678
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:15,979
I'm just trying
to put her down.

679
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:19,316
That's ok, I just
want to look at her for a while.

680
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,484
Ok.

681
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,953
I have to head
into the office.

682
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:25,572
So late?

683
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:28,458
I do whatever Amanda Waller
asks, remember?

684
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:35,715
You ok?

685
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:40,136
Yeah.
Just hurry back.

686
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:44,057
What's with this guy?

687
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:47,227
Outstanding warrants
for assault and battery in Coast City.

688
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:50,180
Got an anonymous tip
he was in Starling.

689
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,816
Anonymous tip, huh?

690
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:56,152
That's a bad break,
buddy.

691
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:15,538
All right.
When can I start?

692
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,712
Do you know how many
of QC's techs

693
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,632
said this data
was unrecoverable?

694
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,550
Only all of them.

695
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:32,622
Seems like this would be a good time
to ask for a few days off, then.

696
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:34,023
You
just started.

697
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:37,060
I know. But...my friend
was struck by lightning

698
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,978
and is in a coma.

699
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,281
Well, was.

700
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,950
I don't know. Um, it's--

701
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,402
A long story.

702
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:48,621
See ya.

703
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:50,790
Thanks.

704
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,486
You did good
over there.

705
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:22,188
I had a good teacher.

706
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,492
A judgmental, occasionally
temperamental one, but...

707
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:28,578
Those are
the best kind.

708
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,751
Did Thea seem...
different to you?

709
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,419
Her hair's a lot shorter.

710
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:39,272
But that's not what you mean.

711
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:40,707
What do you mean?

712
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,425
I don't know.

713
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:44,627
She say anything?

714
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:45,879
She may be...

715
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,681
seeing somebody in
Corto Maltese, or...

716
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:51,434
If Thea was with anybody else,
I've got a feeling

717
00:41:51,436 --> 00:41:52,802
I'd be the last one to know.

718
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,774
Where is she?

719
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,359
Where is Sara?

720
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:08,151
