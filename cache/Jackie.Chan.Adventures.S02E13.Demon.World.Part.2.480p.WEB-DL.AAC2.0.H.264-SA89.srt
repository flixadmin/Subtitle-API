1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,770
Previously on
<i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,438
Mom, dad!

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,841
What brings you out
to Hong Kong?

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,943
Oh!

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,344
Jade: Jackie?

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,679
I'm at the airport!

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,614
Shendu's flying to Australia!

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,849
The book of ages,

9
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:17,950
where all history's

10
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,185
magically recorded!

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,654
Jade: Are you telling me
shendu rules the world?

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,624
Each of the 8 emperors
has his or her own domain!

13
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,326
When shendu wrote in it,

14
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,994
he must have
rewrote the past!

15
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,062
(Gasps)

16
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,064
I'm in demon world!

17
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,999
Why don't I remember
any of it?

18
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,401
This is from the book,

19
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:36,502
and it's about me.

20
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,903
It didn't get rewritten,

21
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,071
so neither did I!

22
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,407
If the book's not here
in shendu's library,

23
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,042
there's only one other
place it could be.

24
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,476
Australia.

25
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,745
This will let us grab
the 12 talismans

26
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,314
that give shendu
his magical powers.

27
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,917
Chan!

28
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,352
(Roars)

29
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,620
Jackie!

30
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,490
(Roars)

31
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,594
Huh?
- Huh?

32
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,163
How can it be?

33
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,000
Huh?

34
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,436
My talisman!

35
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,205
I'm sorry, I'll give
it back, thank you!

36
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,843
Uhh! Oh!

37
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:18,977
Ohh!

38
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,314
How did I do that?

39
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,516
And why
do you not
catch fire?

40
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,121
Dog makes you immortal,

41
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,422
ox makes you super strong.

42
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,557
What else we got?

43
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,658
Speedy rabbit,

44
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,792
levitating rooster,

45
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:34,927
invisible snake,

46
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,795
and explosive dragon.

47
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,697
Ooh! Good ones!

48
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,832
Ohh!

49
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,800
Grr!

50
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:45,037
Maybe we better not try
for the other half dozen.

51
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,676
Grab the supplies!

52
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,377
Forbidden magic's
gonna be hard to come by

53
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,446
out there in demon world.

54
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,054
Tear them apart!

55
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,222
Grr!

56
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,456
Uh-oh.

57
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,121
Levitation plus speed
equals flight.

58
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,422
Huh?
- Huh?

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Whoa!
- Whoa!

60
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,467
Stop them!

61
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,705
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

62
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,612
Oh! Dead end!

63
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,147
Dragon blast.

64
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,086
We'll outrun 'em...

65
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,487
By a hare.

66
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,725
Aah!
- Aah!

67
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,601
Centuries of history
altered.

68
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,869
Your very memory erased.

69
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,239
And still, somehow,
you defy me.

70
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,611
I shall find you, chan,

71
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,979
and I promise you,

72
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,548
I shall erase more
than your memory.

73
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,819
Jade was right, uncle!

74
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,587
I <i> am</i> a hero.

75
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,656
We can infiltrate
the fortress,

76
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,957
find the book of ages,

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,058
and correct history!

78
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,159
Ow!

79
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,061
There is
a big army of ninjas

80
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,063
at the fortress
in no man's land!

81
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,699
No magic trinkets
will help us because

82
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,635
we will be outnumbered!

83
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:30,902
Uncle's right.

84
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:31,970
He is?

85
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,272
If we're gonna
pull this off,

86
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,007
we're gonna need
more muscle.

87
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,108
We're gonna need...

88
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,542
The j-team!

89
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,975
Ooh? Huh?

90
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,412
I see no one here
I would choose
as my apprentice.

91
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,113
Well, look again.

92
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,316
Uhh! Uhh!

93
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,252
He's...Big.

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,921
(Thundering footsteps)

95
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,692
(Uncle gasps)

96
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,727
But po Kong...Is <i> bigger!</i>

97
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,796
Unh!

98
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,002
We must be
in her domain.

99
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,804
Looks like shendu's
keeping all his enemies

100
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:39,971
under demon watch.

101
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,341
More salt for my meal,

102
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,277
or I shall...
Devour you all!

103
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,979
Our hero cannot stop
a demon that size!

104
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,649
You're right.
You do it.

105
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,783
(Gasps)

106
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,118
M-m-m-me?

107
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,391
There's only
one surefire way
to stop a demon,

108
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,760
and that's to
show 'em the door.

109
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,396
Mmm!

110
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,530
Huh?

111
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,698
Chan?

112
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,568
Page 94, follow
the instructions!

113
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,436
You run interference!

114
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,972
Bwaa!

115
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,384
Jackie!
Leap and kick!

116
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,952
Leap and kick!

117
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,188
Uhh! Oh, gee!

118
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,125
(Groans)

119
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,259
Aah!

120
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,562
Bwaa!

121
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,034
Ohh!

122
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,570
Oooh.

123
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,972
Uncle, hurry!

124
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,407
I do not have
the symbol

125
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,409
of the immortal
who defeated her!

126
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,745
Fire was sword,
water was gourd,
sky was flute...

127
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,946
Bwoh!

128
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,047
Mmm!

129
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,884
You are going
to be scrumptious!

130
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,686
Earth was flower,
wind was fan,
mountain was...

131
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,854
Drum!

132
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,824
Tohru!

133
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,326
You--you know my name?

134
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,729
Talk later.
Bang the drum
3 times.

135
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,103
(Coughing, sputtering)

136
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,238
(Chanting)

137
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,650
Aah! Ah!

138
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,285
No!

139
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,823
Bwaa!

140
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,124
Oh, ohh.

141
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,363
That was
a very good spell.

142
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,332
(Cheering and laughing)

143
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,036
(Both grunting)

144
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,772
No mercy, gladiators!

145
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,207
Battle to the finish!

146
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,209
(Both grunting)

147
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,278
El toro will win.
El toro is the greatest!

148
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,947
(Uncle chanting)

149
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,616
Waaa!

150
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,222
Huh?

151
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,557
Fancy fan-work
courtesy of paco--

152
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,526
El toro's
biggest fan!

153
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,529
Finally we can remove
these ridiculous masks.

154
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,399
El toro fuerte <i> never</i>
removes his mask.

155
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,677
What?

156
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,746
No music
while I bathe?

157
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,682
Sing for me,
my little
caged songbird!

158
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,217
Tweet, tweet.

159
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,853
(Uncle chants,
flute plays)

160
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,788
What? Who's
playing the flute?

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,624
I despise the flute!

162
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,560
(Uncle chanting)

163
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,962
No! No!

164
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,338
Who <i> are</i> you guys?

165
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,175
Everybody,
- say hello to viper--

166
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,411
the craftiest member
of the j-team.

167
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,813
"Team," huh?

168
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,483
It's a wrap.
The j-team is
reassembled,

169
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,653
and hsi wu's
singing career
is down the drain.

170
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,354
(Thunder rumbles)

171
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,127
Uh, guess
you didn't know
hsi wu was scrubbing up

172
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,496
'cause he was
expecting company.

173
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,998
The thunder demon!

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,574
Jackie: Ah! Watch out!

175
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,108
(All yelling)

176
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,613
Aah! Oh!

177
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,649
(Grunting)

178
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,690
Heh. Time flies
when you're having fun.

179
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,159
Viper: Give me
your hand, sweetie.

180
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,460
(Grunts)

181
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,896
(Growling)

182
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,297
(Grunting)

183
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,668
Leap and kick,
leap and kick,
leap and kick.

184
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,645
Go, Jackie.

185
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,380
Your mouse man
is good, Jade,

186
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,649
but El toro
is the best!

187
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,751
No time
for that now, paco.

188
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,021
How's that
portal spell
coming, uncle?

189
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,190
You did not mention
that the thunder demon

190
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,625
would be in this domain!

191
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,994
We do not have
the symbol of
the immortal

192
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,129
who originally
defeated him!

193
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,731
(Sigh)
And it's not like

194
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,733
we can
pull castanets
out of thin air.

195
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:35,934
Castanets?

196
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,469
I prefer
the maracas,

197
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,071
but they
are too large
for my pockets.

198
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,243
(Grunts)
Ohh!

199
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,420
Sorry.

200
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,860
(Uncle chanting)

201
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,261
(Clicking)

202
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,566
(Grunts) No!

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,508
What are we waiting for?
To the book of ages!

204
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,788
Chan!

205
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,157
So he <i> is</i>
behind this!

206
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,393
And things were
going <i> so</i> well.

207
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,897
We were even
almost beginning
to like you, brother.

208
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,399
(Sputters)
What do you mean?

209
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,234
I was just
coming to visit...

210
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,369
Hsi wu?

211
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,072
He has been banished
to the netherworld!

212
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,478
Technology?

213
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,813
The child!

214
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,214
She somehow
escaped

215
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,949
the historical
alterations.

216
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,652
And if she knows
the history that was...

217
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,021
Then chan now
knows of the book.

218
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,032
What's up,
Mr. pouty snout?

219
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,100
(Sighs)

220
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,502
I do not belong
with these heroes.

221
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,204
The ox
made me strong.

222
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,638
Without it, I'm--

223
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,974
hello? The talismans
never made Jackie chan
a hero.

224
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,976
You didn't even <i> like</i>
to use 'em.

225
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,712
Courage, brains, and heart
are your secret weapons,

226
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,581
and you've
already got those.

227
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,549
All you need
is proper training.

228
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,918
Jackie, I can teach you
what you taught me.

229
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,086
You game?

230
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,287
Game.

231
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,922
Cool! First lesson--

232
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,390
the ancient art
of butt whoop

233
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,625
starts with breathing.

234
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,228
The breath flows
to the fingertips,

235
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,163
then down to the toes.

236
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,170
Jade: The book lies
behind those walls.

237
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,638
Ready, team?

238
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,743
Let's make history.

239
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,249
There is no way in.

240
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,683
Both: T'ch!

241
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,630
Guys in pajamas.

242
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,864
They don't look
so tough.

243
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,918
I <i> am</i> good at this.

244
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,052
Duh.

245
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,688
The mouse man
is not bad, but--

246
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,789
don't start.

247
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,090
(Grunts)

248
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,293
Haagh!

249
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,262
(Grunts)

250
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,397
Uhh!

251
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,039
(Whistles)

252
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,374
And they didn't even
use the talismans.

253
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,776
(Rumbling)

254
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,961
Quick!
The spells!

255
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,098
What spells?

256
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,703
(Demonic laughter)

257
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,609
(Demonic laughter)

258
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,143
(Demons roar)

259
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,654
Quickly! Locate
the book of ages!

260
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,456
We better split up.

261
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,227
Bai tza: Destroy them!

262
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,239
(Roars)

263
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,711
(Growls)

264
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,180
Shendu and his
accursed talismans.

265
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,686
(Grunts)

266
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,322
(Gasps)

267
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,592
You're not
the only girl with
tricks up her sleeve.

268
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,560
(Shrieks)

269
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,501
(Snarls)

270
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,270
But you are
the only one
who can do that.

271
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,410
Behold my mastery
of gravity!

272
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,511
Unhh!

273
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,812
(Grunts)

274
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:53,051
Behold my mastery
of, uh, <i> pollo.</i>

275
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,187
(Both grunting)

276
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,597
Jackie, help uncle search!

277
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,302
Stop fooling!

278
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,437
Fooling?

279
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,138
I'm not immortal!

280
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,341
Pff! Excuses!

281
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,979
Gaah!

282
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,988
Bingo!

283
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,926
There it is.

284
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,562
The book of ages?

285
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,733
Locate the page
shendu altered

286
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,668
so that we may
change it back.

287
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,769
No problem.

288
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,405
Look for a page
with a missing corner.

289
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,478
(Gasps) Unhh.

290
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,682
(Sinister hiss)

291
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,354
Whoa!

292
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,655
(Grunts)

293
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,058
(Groans)

294
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,236
(Grunting)

295
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,577
T'ch. There's, like,
5 million pages here!

296
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,946
Shendu: Get away
from that book!

297
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,549
(Groans)

298
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,850
Surrender.

299
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,153
Your team has been
neutralized.

300
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,988
Big whoop.

301
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,260
If I can't find
shendu's changes,

302
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,694
I'll make
some of my own.

303
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,264
"And then Jackie
grew 20 feet tall."

304
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,802
(Growls)
- (Gasps)

305
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,105
Heeyah!

306
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,207
Now Jackie
<i>is</i> the greatest!

307
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,909
You!

308
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,878
Jackie: Shendu!

309
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,250
The girl!

310
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,553
"Here comes...

311
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,955
Super tohru!"

312
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,491
(Growls)
Huh?

313
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,727
(Grunts)

314
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,930
"Say hello...
To robo-viper."

315
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,335
Like nuking fish

316
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,536
in a barrel.

317
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,871
(Shrieks)

318
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,207
My turn!

319
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,046
Hey, no fair!

320
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,215
Now El toro
is the greatest!

321
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,816
Jackie is!

322
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,384
El toro.
- Jackie.
- El toro.

323
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,719
El toro.
- Jackie.

324
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,055
You want to defeat
the demons? Yes?

325
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,791
Then write that uncle
banishes the demons
already!

326
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,092
Duh!
- Duh!

327
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,865
(Chanting)

328
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,240
Bad day...

329
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,674
For demons.

330
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,616
Demons: No!

331
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:17,989
I will have
my revenge, chan!

332
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,927
Yes!
Ha ha!
We did it!

333
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,762
Hotcha!

334
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,331
I have found
the page!

335
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,500
Uh, this means you
can change us back,

336
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,635
right, uncle?

337
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,903
Once we
make changes

338
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,371
to shendu's
changes.

339
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,339
Ooh, here!

340
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,042
Don't want to lose
my place in history.

341
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,215
Jade!
- Jade!

342
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,317
Mom! Dad!

343
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,518
Cousin Jackie!

344
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,586
Uncle!

345
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,221
What brings you
to Hong Kong?

346
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,423
Tohru:
Hong Kong moose world.

347
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,928
Uh, look at the watch
Jackie got me!

348
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,229
Paco: Moose world?

349
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,463
Can I go, too?

350
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,933
What mooses? We were
fighting demo--unhh!

351
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,467
Uh, traffic!

352
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,970
We were fighting
Hong Kong traffic
to visit you.

353
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,906
So I could show you
how much I've learned
in America.

354
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,341
We know you
have been doing

355
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,742
very well there,
Jade.

356
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,145
No doubt due to
cousin Jackie's

357
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,080
excellent
training.

358
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,248
In all honesty,

359
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,750
it is Jade who
sometimes trains me.

360
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,527
Hey, Jackie!

361
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,262
What kinds of
martial arts do you know?

362
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,264
So many, so many style

363
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,733
you talking
of martial arts--a thousand.

364
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,104
Most important,
whatever you learn,

365
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,174
it doesn't matter
karate, hapkido--whatever.

366
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,209
But everybody
has the same goal--

367
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,278
it's discipline.

368
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,380
It's not fighting,
remember.
