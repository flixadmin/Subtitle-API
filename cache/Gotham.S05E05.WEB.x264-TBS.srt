1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,860
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,100
Where's Jeremiah?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Selina, she's not herself, Alfred.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,960
She's desperate for revenge.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,960
You can't save her from herself.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,510
This time, woke up on a rooftop.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,440
No idea how I got there or what happened

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,860
during the preceding hours.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,039
In Haven, as long as we survive,

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
hope survives in Gotham.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,060
You've been promising me help for weeks.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm working on getting you help.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,000
I promise I won't stop

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,800
until I find those responsible.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,240
I've got a lead on a guy selling RPGs.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,540
Oh, oh, please don't hurt me.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,240
I just want to know what you saw.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,180
You had some kind of a rocket.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,460
And you shot it at that building.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,500
Raise your hands, Mr. Gordon.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,260
I'm sorry, Steve, they made me do it.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,400
All right, be quiet, you.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,200
Miss Zant, we're sorry to
interrupt your breakfast,

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,200
but you'll come with us, quickly.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,420
You may lower your
hands now, Mr. Gordon.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,800
Turn around.

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,940
There a problem, Officer?

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,340
We know you sold the RPG
that took out Haven.

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,260
So?

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,880
So I want to know who bought it.

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,500
Or what? You gonna arrest me?

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,360
Who said anything about arresting you?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,540
I want a name.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,039
What do you say, boys?

35
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,219
Should we show this lawman

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,940
how we feel about uninvited guests?

37
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,460
Now, who told you I sold that RPG?

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,280
Eduardo?

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,820
Nice shot, right?

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,529
Lower your weapon now.

41
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,539
Delta Force,

42
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,630
stand down.

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,460
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,080
Come on. The last time I saw you,

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,430
you were running through sniper fire,

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
plucking my sorry ass
from a burning truck.

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,920
Least I could do was pay you back.

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,340
I had that guy right where I wanted him.

49
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm glad you're here.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,520
Yeah, me, too.

51

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,460
We hated each other in boot.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,040
Jim disapproved of my ops tempo.

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,080
Yeah, 'cause you only
had one speed: too fast.

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,979
Took me a while to
realize he wasn't afraid

56
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,840
to get his hands dirty.
Just being careful.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,899
- Yeah.
- Well, Jim's taught me a thing or two

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,940
about being careful.

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,270
So what's the mission plan?

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,940
Well, we are the help
Secretary Walker promised.

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,540
Our goal is to make this
hellhole safe again.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,950
So it took the murder of
hundreds of innocent civilians

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
to get the government to act?

64
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,180
We're here to eliminate
all criminal threats.

65
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,690
We're gonna blanket the
city with flash sweeps.

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,280
Well, what about the people
that are still trapped here?

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,180
- They need relief now.
- Hey, I'm with you,

68
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420
but my mandate's clear:

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,240
first we restore order, then
we take the next steps.

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,100
Sir.

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,519
We got something, sir.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Captain Gordon, this is my second,

73
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,370
Sergeant Angel Vallelunga.

74
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,700
Captain.

75
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,200
Ledger.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,000
Our arms dealer kept
track of his buyers.

77
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,380
"Edward Nygma.

78
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,980
Two RPG."

79
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,520
Nygma.

80
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,520
Yeah, that name's on my list.

81
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,980
Think he's our bomber?

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,390
Only one way to find out.

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,080
All right, you and I will get Nygma.

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,880
Harvey, I need you to set up

85
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,840
a command center with
the soldiers at GCPD.

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,540
- I'll grab some guys.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Hey, look, hey, Jim.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm not as fast as I used to be,

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,460
but I still got some fight in me.

90
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,700
I'm not a desk jockey. I'm a street guy.

91
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,340
What you are is the
best cop that I know.

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,780
We're going after Nygma.
He's ten steps ahead.

93
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,040
This thing goes sideways,
you're gonna have to take over.

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,500
I need your help, buddy.

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,520
I got it.

96
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,490
Alfred.

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,579
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

98
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,219
There's been a break
in the Haven bombing.

99
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,380
Seems that Gordon and Bullock

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,460
have got a rather strong
lead, apparently.

101
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,820
What's the matter with you?

102
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,260
I can't find Selina.

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,500
I've looked all over the Green Zone.

104
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,039
Somehow, I think Miss
Kyle is perfectly capable

105
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,940
of looking after herself, Master Bruce.

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,059
Except that she's not herself.

107
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,950
You saw what she did to Jeremiah.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,720
Yes. I did.

109
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,400
Listen, come here.

110
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,980
Jeremiah Valeska deserved to die.

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,740
Jeremiah made Selina a murderer.

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Just like Ra's made me a murderer.

113
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,980
Ra's goaded you

114
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,900
into stabbing him, Master Bruce.

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,980
He used you as an instrument.
You're no murderer.

116
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,180
But Selina is.

117
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,420
You're not the same.

118
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,959
She did what she did with open eyes,

119
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,380
and you got to learn
to respect that, son.

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,040
You're wrong about her, Alfred.

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
And I'm gonna go find her.

122
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,740
It's Monday, 5:32 p.m.

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm standing in a dumpster.
My head hurts.

124
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,580
It's happened again. It's...
Saturday, 12:16 a.m.

125
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,519
My fingernails are full of dirt.

126
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,340
Have I been digging?

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,850
_

128
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,039
I think it's Sunday. I
can't find my watch.

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,600
And it's dark outside, my feet are wet.

130
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,879
There's mud everywhere.

131
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,260
God!

132
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,040
It doesn't make any sense!

133
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,000
You're not a murderer, Ed.

134
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,520
Except Kristen Kringle.

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,220
And Officer Dougherty.

136
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,110
But all those people... and children.

137
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,760
How could you do it?

138
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,440
Why?!

139
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,150
It doesn't matter why.

140
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,060
What matters

141
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,160
is that it was you who killed them.

142
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,120
Not me.

143
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,219
Edward Nygma, you're under
arrest for the attack at Haven

144
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,100
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

145
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,460
No.

146
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,800
No, Jim, I can explain.

147
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,440
Explain?

148
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,640
You son of a bitch. You actually did it?

149
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,100
- On your knees, now.
- No! I didn't.

150
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,150
I can prove it, I just,

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
I need... I need a little bit of time.

152
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,840
Say the word, Jim.

153
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,260
You know me, Jim.

154
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,900
The people that I...

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,460
have hurt, they hurt me first.

156
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,480
I didn't know a single person in Haven.

157
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm innocent.

158
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,440
It's your call, buddy.

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,820
He basically confessed.

160
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,600
We bring him in.

161
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,440
He stands trial.

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,980
Yeah, I don't think so.

163
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,400
Your friend is standing
on a pressure-plated IED.

164
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,020
One of several throughout the rooms.

165
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,220
Twitch, and you'll repaint
the room with your organs.

166
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,420
Don't do it, Jim.

167
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,600
This little doohickey
monitors my heartbeat.

168
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,259
It increases by ten?

169
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,689
Boom.

170
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,330
Decreases by ten?

171
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,700
Boom.

172
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,080
You try to walk out of here,

173
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,459
and a special forces sniper
will put a bullet in your head.

174
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,469
No, they won't.

175
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,540
This thing can detonate his
bomb from a mile away.

176
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,520
Or am I bluffing?

177
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,020
Once words gets out that
you're responsible for Haven,

178
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,580
you'll have a target on your back.

179
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll take my chances.

180
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,680
- I think he's bluffing.
- No, no.

181
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,960
He doesn't bluff.

182
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,799
I don't want anyone here

183
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,459
- if this thing detonates.
- You heard the man.

184
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,259
Tell Sergeant Vallelunga to stand down.

185
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,140
- Yes, sir.
- Nygma walks.

186
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,840
A wristband that
monitors his heart rate.

187
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,500
Welcome to Gotham.

188
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,440
So what we do?

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,060
Well, the way I see it,
now we're all tied up.

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,810
I just got to save your
life one more time,

191
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,300
then I'm back in the lead.

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,399
Funny. Seriously, the
hell are we gonna do?

193
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,920
Well, he pulled a book
to set the booby trap.

194
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,550
I think I can make it.

195
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,660
Assuming the vibrations don't
trigger the IED, what then?

196
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,239
Then we just got to figure out

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,659
what sort of puzzle
he wants us to solve.

198
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,030
Puzzle?

199
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,939
There's always a puzzle with Nygma.

200
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,480
You ready?

201
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,240
Chess Strategy: Knight
Moves Nimbly in the Dark.

202
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm gonna wring this nerd's neck.

203
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,960
In chess,

204
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,390
knights move in an "L."

205
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,520
Two spaces straight,

206
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,600
then one at a 90-degree angle.

207
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,240
Butterfly Collecting with Conviction.

208
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,510
Or...

209
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,240
Chess Strategy:

210
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,820
Knight's Gambit: Escaping Checkmate.

211
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
You okay?

212
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,950
You left the Army for this city?

213
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,550
It grows on you.

214
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,420
Harvey, come in.

215
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,240
Jim, you nab Nygma?

216
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,990
No. Put the word out:

217
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,260
Nygma's wanted for murder
and the attack on Haven.

218
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,330
I'm looking for Selina.

219
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,590
Follow me.

220
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,799
Everybody,

221
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,400
raise your glasses to the killer

222
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
of Jeremiah Valeska.

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,680
The freak is dead!

224
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,460
The freak is dead!

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,080
The freak is dead! The freak is dead!

226
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,100
Citizens of Gotham,

227
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,700
this is a special bulletin
from the police department.

228
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,699
We have identified the person who fired

229
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,360
a rocket-propelled grenade
that decimated Haven.

230
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,360
Be on the lookout for a tall, skinny man

231
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,920
who goes by the name of Ed Nygma.

232
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,180
He was last seen wearing a
green suit and eyeglasses.

233
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,070
Ed Nygma.

234
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,940
The monster of Haven.

235
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,579
- Let's go get him!
- Yeah!

236
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,020
Let's kill him!

237
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,100
Kill him!

238
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,060
Kill him! Kill him!

239
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,460
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

240
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,790
Excellent.

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,340
200 bullets, as promised. Go have fun.

242
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,799
And there's more where that came from

243
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
if you keep up the good work.

244
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
Off you go.

245
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,280
Mr. Cobblepot, sir.

246
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,180
- It's...
- What? What?

247
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,760
"Edward Nygma is the monster res...

248
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,780
responsible for killing
the innocents at Haven."

249
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,320
Ed, what have you done?

250
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,820
I saw him go that way! He's over there!

251
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,600
Get him! Come on!

252
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
Bang Zero-One.

253
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,860
This is Bird Zero-Two.

254
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,900
What's your status, Angel?

255
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,999
We cleared 13th to 36th Street,

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,260
west of Broadway. Gonna
keep pushing uptown.

257
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,890
That's progress. Still no Nygma.

258
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,860
My boys will scoop him up by nightfall.

259
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,560
Now tell me about this... Scarecrow.

260
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,440
Well, he has chemical weapons.

261
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,960
Your guys will need gas masks.

262
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,280
But taking him down would be a big win.

263
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,240
Well, that's why we're here.

264
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,519
Psst.

265
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,020
Hey.

266
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,020
Time to wake up.

267
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,159
Who are you?

268
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm the woman who's gonna
carry out your execution.

269
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
That's just a taste.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
It's only fair you die slow and painful

271
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,410
to pay for JoJo.

272
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
Who's JoJo?

273
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,999
JoJo was in Haven

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,740
when you blew it up.

275
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,760
This is a joke, right?

276
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,800
300 people died in Haven.

277
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,120
We don't care about people.

278
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,660
Yeah!

279
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,380
Look at how happy JoJo was.

280
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,560
He always had a smile on his face.

281
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,820
You anthropomorphizing nincompoop.

282
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,940
Dogs can't smile.

283
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,900
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

284
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,519
What the hell?

285
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,920
Floor it!

286
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah!

287
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
Yeah!

288
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,130
Yeah!

289
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,820
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

290
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,570
Did I say stop?

291
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm sorry, Ma.

292
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,510
Ma, can't we just beat him to death?

293
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,959
It's not starting.

294
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,490
Yes. Anything but electrocution.

295
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,460
Please don't let me die this way.

296
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,940
Oh, thank God the fuel line's clogged.

297
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,220
Unclog the line.

298
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,900
We got it, we got it. Come on.

299
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,440
Please.

300
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,460
Shoot me, stab me,

301
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,280
anything but another jolt.

302
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,840
Hit it.

303
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,760
Oh, no!

304
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,920
Put it out!

305
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,000
Boys! Oh, my Lord!

306
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,480
Help him! Help him!

307
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,180
Who's gonna fix who, Oswald?

308
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,279
The Army's invading the city,

309
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,649
locking everyone up.

310
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,950
- They're coming this way.
- Please.

311
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,460
An invasion is tanks, infantry.

312
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,880
These are scouts.

313
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,519
What about Nygma?

314
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,360
Nobody's seen him, but
we got feelers out.

315
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,740
Well, you tell your "feelers"

316
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,060
that the first man to bring me Nygma

317
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,280
is the one who gets to live.

318
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,660
Now!

319
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,080
I am surrounded by morons, Edward.

320
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,619
If I didn't have an empire to run,

321
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,800
I would go get Nygma myself.

322
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,219
Hello, Oswald.

323
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,240
We have a great deal to talk about.

324
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,640
But first,

325
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,480
did you name your dog after me?

326
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,560
Jim, Harper just radioed.

327
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,440
She saw Nygma going into City Hall.

328
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,920
He's going to Penguin.

329
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,619
Cobblepot's at the top of my list

330
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,999
from Walker. Sounds like a twofer.

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,020
Penguin's sitting on all

332
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,400
the ammo in Gotham.

333
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,940
He's better defended, better
manned than anyone else.

334
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,260
We need shock and awe.

335
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,500
Shock and awe is my default.

336
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,660
You ready?

337
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,260
You know what, take Harvey on this one.

338
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,979
I'll keep things locked down here.

339
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,500
Let's saddle up.

340
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,440
Man, you're killing my buzz.

341
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,840
Selina.

342
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,290
I know you, and this isn't you.

343
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,200
- You know me?
- Yes.

344
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,940
Maybe better than you know yourself.

345
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,300
Let me tell you something.

346
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,360
That night

347
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,180
that your parents were murdered,

348
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,380
I was in that alley

349
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,400
on the fire escape.

350
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,490
And I watched that guy

351
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,260
shoot your father

352
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,200
and shoot your mother.

353
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,600
And through it all,

354
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,700
I did... nothing.

355
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,620
I didn't call for help, I didn't...

356
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,820
I didn't scream for the guy to stop.

357
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,520
It wasn't your fault. You
were just a scared kid.

358
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,900
No.

359
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,920
You were the scared kid.

360
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,820
We are not the same, Bruce.

361
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,850
I didn't do anything because I
wasn't willing to risk my neck

362
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,680
for someone else because I didn't care.

363
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,520
That's who I was and that's who I am.

364
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,640
I love this song.

365
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,900
♪ When I want to go, I
know what you'll say... ♪

366
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,080
What did you do to me, Oswald?

367
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,120
What are you talking about?

368
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,280
Oh, please.

369
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,810
You did something to me.

370
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,400
You...

371
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,719
You are the reason

372
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,920
that I killed those people.

373
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,120
How could you?

374
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,130
You have made me into
some murderous puppet.

375
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
For weeks,

376
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,680
I've been waking up in strange places,

377
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,720
not knowing how I got
there or what I did.

378
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,400
Driving myself mad,

379
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,340
thinking I had gone mad.

380
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,520
And now I know that it
was all your doing.

381
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
Of everything

382
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,920
that you have put me through,

383
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,350
this...

384
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,320
this is the most cruel.

385
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,560
Ed.

386
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

387
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,040
I did not make you do anything.

388
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,200
Then what is "I'll fix you"?

389
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,940
What did that mean? You didn't fix me.

390
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,919
You broke me!

391
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,880
W-W-Wait. No.

392
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,160
I said that to you the night
the bridges blew. I-I...

393
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,080
Think I wouldn't remember?

394
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,120
No, Ed, I saved your life!

395
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,080
That's it!

396
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,820
What are you talking about?

397
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,279
You had been stabbed,

398
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,640
I paid Hugo Strange to save your life.

399
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,199
I bet he did something to you

400
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,780
when he was patching you up.

401
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,100
You paid Hugo Strange to save me?

402
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,810
Why?

403
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,410
What was I supposed to do? Let you die?

404
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,300
After Butch, you were my only friend.

405
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,740
You shot Butch!

406
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,160
Which is why I needed you!

407
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,430
Edward Nygma,

408
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,040
if I wanted you to suffer,

409
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,710
I would never do it in
some backhanded way.

410
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,239
If you and I

411
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,160
are ever at odds again,

412
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,680
you will know, without a doubt,

413
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,880
that I am your enemy.

414
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,200
I promise you that...

415
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,320
... as a friend.

416
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,720
What a mess.

417
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,360
I might have killed you, Oswald.

418
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,700
And if that day comes...

419
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,980
I swear to you...

420
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,040
... I will stare you in the eye

421
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,600
as I stab you in the heart.

422
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,280
Look on the bright side.

423
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,620
If Hugo Strange did do something to you,

424
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,940
it means you are not
responsible for Haven.

425
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,980
Where is he?

426
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,120
Sir, GCPD and the Army
have blown the gates.

427
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,680
Stay here. You'll be safe.

428
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,920
Grab Nygma. They want him, not me.

429
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,720
He's gone.

430
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,180
Idiot! Ugh!

431
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,960
Why, hello, Harvey.

432
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,060
Now, last time we were in a standoff,

433
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,700
you ran out of bullets.

434
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,820
I hope you're better prepared.

435
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,340
We don't want to take
your territory, Oswald.

436
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,170
But you have to put down your weapons

437
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,770
and hand over Ed Nygma.

438
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,180
Or, if you and your friends aren't out

439
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,260
by the time I count to three,

440
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,200
I will mow you all down!

441
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,280
We good?

442
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,560
Yep.

443
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,640
Go ahead. Count.

444
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,220
Harvey, you're not thinking clearly.

445
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,940
Maybe call your boss,

446
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,940
see what he thinks.

447
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't have to call anyone.

448
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,380
Go ahead. Count.

449
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,620
One...

450
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,480
How's that for better prepared?

451
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,260
Where's Ed Nygma?

452
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,270
The whole of Gotham is looking for you.

453
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,380
I need information, your specialty.

454
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,420
I am going to cut your face

455
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,510
into a jigsaw puzzle

456
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,720
and watch you try and put
it back together again.

457
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,580
Barbara... Barbara! Am I dumb?

458
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,640
In all the years of plotting

459
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,180
and the betrayals between us,

460
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,680
have you ever... ever...
known me to do something

461
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,400
as idiotically brutal as shoot a rocket

462
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,020
into a building full of innocent people?

463
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,580
I did not kill those people in Haven.

464
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,470
Not exactly.

465
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,180
There's more going on here.

466
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm waiting.

467
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,440
The night the bridges fell,

468
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,820
I was hurt. Oswald took
me to Hugo Strange.

469
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,800
And he did something to my brain.

470
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,560
And that's your excuse for
murdering hundreds of people?

471
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,430
I'm saying that Strange, or somebody,

472
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,220
can control me.

473
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,400
They killed those people.

474
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,540
Okay, let's say, by some
miracle, I believe you.

475
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,260
Why the hell should I help you?

476
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,620
Because who's working with Strange?

477
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Who would force me to
kill all of those people?

478
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,140
Information is your lifeblood.

479
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,319
You help me,

480
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,420
and I will give you the
best intel you've ever had.

481
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,100
I don't know where Strange is.

482
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,840
But I can tell you where
you'll find his Igors.

483
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,010
Where is Edward Nygma?

484
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,640
You're protecting a mass murderer.

485
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,400
Don't look to me for sympathy.

486
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,520
Fine.

487
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
But not with that meathead around.

488
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,579
You know,

489
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,960
they say you can judge
a man by his friends.

490
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,920
This from a man who has no friends.

491
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,470
Talk.

492
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,740
Nygma's a patsy.

493
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,350
He is not a mass murderer.

494
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,060
Puzzles, games,

495
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,099
perhaps the odd killing here and there,

496
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,420
but hundreds of people?

497
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,920
No. That's not him. You know this.

498
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,230
So who set him up?

499
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,220
Jim, you want information,

500
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,740
I want to go home.

501
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,980
- Eduardo's not gonna go for that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

502
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,840
I thought you were in charge.

503
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,840
Even if I were to let you go,

504
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,220
sooner or later, the
Army's gonna come for you.

505
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,520
Things are changing in Gotham.

506
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,220
I'll take my chances.

507
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,220
Now,

508
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,560
do you want Nygma or not?

509
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,540
I know where Nygma's going.

510
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,780
I trust you know what you're doing.

511
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,780
We do what we have to do, right?

512
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,050
Gentlemen.

513
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,380
Come in. You're late.

514
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,880
The last body you procured
for me was gangrenous.

515
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,220
Completely unsuitable.

516
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,460
Oh, my.

517
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,160
Bye.

518
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,730
Hello, Professor.

519
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,490
Mr. Nygma.

520
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,880
Let's skip the part where you deny

521
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,940
making me into a killing machine.

522
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,560
Tell me how you took
control of my alter ego.

523
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,700
I don't follow.

524
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,070
You did something to access

525
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,740
the Ed Nygma side of my personality.

526
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
But... you're Ed Nygma.

527
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,270
I'm also the Riddler!

528
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,600
Tell me what you did!

529
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,199
Why did you make me
kill all those people

530
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,639
in Haven?

531
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,940
You did that?

532
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,760
How interesting.

533
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,660
I had no idea.

534
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,420
You really expect me to believe that?

535
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,160
Mr. Nygma, I don't know anything about

536
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,960
your alter egos.

537
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
But I will confess that

538
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,250
when I was sewing up your knife wound,

539
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,139
I may have tinkered a little
with your grey matter.

540
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,220
- Would you just...
- I put a chip in your brain.

541
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,120
It allows you to be able
to be controlled remotely.

542
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,500
I knew it.

543
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
But I don't control you.

544
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,440
I gave control to others.

545
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,540
Who?

546
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,820
I will write it down.

547
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,560
That way, if I'm ever confronted,

548
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,160
I can honestly say
that I never told you.

549
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,880
Not to worry.

550
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,480
You're experiencing a
simple neural cutout.

551
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,860
I am mystified as to how
you've become aware

552
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,900
you're being controlled.

553
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,139
I suppose we're just going
to have to open you up

554
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,960
and take a look under the hood.

555
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,040
Won't we?

556
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,999
Jim.

557
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,960
Sorry, kid, it's just me.

558
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,110
You all right?

559
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,380
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
just looking for Jim.

560
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,860
It's nothing.

561
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,540
I saw soldiers downstairs.

562
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah, the Army's finally
gotten off their asses

563
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,200
and decided to help.

564
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Jim's out with them now.

565
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,990
Are you sure you're all right?

566
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,320
I don't know.

567
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,960
I see people losing
their will to do good.

568
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,040
People I love.

569
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,499
What if we don't make it out of this?

570
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,840
I'm not gonna lie, kid.

571
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,159
These past few months,

572
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,880
I've wondered the same thing.

573
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,500
And when I don't know what to do,

574
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,780
I come up here and I dig
into these case files.

575
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,000
I sit my ass down and I get to work.

576
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,790
I used to hate this kind of paperwork;

577
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,519
now it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

578
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,779
Why?

579
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,100
Because the little things mater.

580
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,980
Act by act, deed by deed,
it means something.

581
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,340
Even if no one notices

582
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,910
or cares.

583
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,180
Thanks, Harvey.

584
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,640
You're welcome, kid.

585
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,760
If you really want to
do an old man a favor,

586
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,460
you can scrounge me up a cup
of joe because I, uh...

587
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,420
Kid's fast.

588
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,880
I apologize for the discomfort.

589
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,940
The neural cutout inhibits
muscular function,

590
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,910
but not pain receptors.

591
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,399
A simple reboot of the chip
should be all that is required.

592
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,510
Although, the sound may be...

593
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,240
... uh, somewhat unpleasant.

594
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,000
Not to mention the smell.

595
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,000
Edward, I believe the time has come

596
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,490
for a change of scenery.

597
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,570
It seems a powerful electrical charge

598
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,699
overloaded your chip,

599
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
but I've gotten everything updated.

600
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,599
I will pass the good news
along to your handler.

601
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,880
Care to expand on that?

602
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,220
I was merely helping a man who
needed medical attention.

603
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,680
Yeah, not buying it.

604
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,220
His eyes are open.

605
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,190
I gave him a biomedical anesthesia.

606
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,250
Wake him up now. Do it.

607
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,960
Oh, very well.

608
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,319
Oh!

609
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,400
I told you this wasn't me!

610
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,910
He put a chip in my brain.

611
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,110
And someone's been controlling
it this whole time.

612
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,780
And then he drilled in my head!

613
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,320
Better talk now.

614
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,639
I am a scientist.

615
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,380
A contract came along;
I developed a tool.

616
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,520
"A tool"? How dare you?

617
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,400
A contract from who?

618
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,900
Please escort the
professor out, thank you.

619
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,140
Ta-ta.

620
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,420
What the hell is going on?

621
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,340
Sorry, pal, but this part
of the op is need-to-know.

622
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,800
I couldn't say anything until
we had the suspect in custody,

623
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,880
but Walker wants Ed Nygma taken out now.

624
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,150
Walker was behind this?

625
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,780
She's been controlling
Nygma the whole time?

626
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,190
You know I hate this spook crap.

627
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,620
I don't ask questions; I follow orders.

628
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,460
She's responsible for Haven?

629
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,959
I don't understand, why...

630
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,930
Jim, stop right there, trust me.

631
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,920
Walker wants you to put a bullet

632
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,660
in his brain.

633
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,460
No.

634
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,480
Call it proof of loyalty.

635
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,479
It's what she needs from you
before she can move forward

636
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,220
with final relief plans.

637
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,880
Hey, come on. Look at him.

638
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,499
He's a loon.

639
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,990
A cop-killer.

640
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,630
Tell me the truth.

641
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,640
Did Walker destroy Haven? Did you know?

642
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,300
- Tell me.
- Jim, ours is not to reason why.

643
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,400
And this is your chance to
be a part of this mission.

644
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,340
So...

645
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,640
please.

646
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,020
You pull the trigger on him,

647
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,720
or I pull the trigger on you.

648
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,140
After all this, you'd kill
me for some bureaucrat?

649
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,120
Mission comes first.

650
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,320
You taught me that.

651
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,330
What's your answer?

652
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,980
Looks like I saved your
life one too many times.

653
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,550
Maybe so.

654
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,940
You know Jim Gordon.

655
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,440
You know this city.

656
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,560
Find him.

657
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,340
And kill him.

658
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,270
Boss. Wake up.

659
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,120
Wake up.

660
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,540
Ouch.

661
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,780
Oh! Stitches still sore, huh?

662
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,430
Never would have happened

663
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,650
if you wore that armor I prepared.

664
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,900
That bullet is making you sentimental.

665
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,660
Give her a shake, huh?

666
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,930
Hmm. Better?

667
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,500
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

668
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,080
into my flesh at least once.

669
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,310
Verisimilitude trumps
precaution, you see.

670
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,680
I get it.

671
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,330
Selina Kyle and Bruce
Wayne needed to think

672
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,660
you were dead, boss.

673
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,950
Yeah. Right.

674
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,720
I take it you have news?

675
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,180
All systems go.

676
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,090
- Well, then lead the way.
- Oh!

677
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,370
Doctor.

678
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm hearing good things.

679
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,840
The bandages are ready to come off.

680
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,180
Your assistant thought you'd
like to see the results.

681
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,020
Indeed, I would.

682
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh, you two look beautiful.

683
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,640
Oh...

684
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,560
I love family reunions, don't you?

685
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,640
