1
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,170
Lamb men make good slaves.

2
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,930
Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,

3
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,050
and the slavers will give us gold...

4
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,600
...and silk, and steel.

5
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,350
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

6
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,560
The riders do her honor.

7
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,940
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

8
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,110
I will bring you her tongue.

9
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,990
Do as I command
or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

10
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,250
Moon of my life,

11
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

12
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,930
a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.

13
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,850
Tell me the truth of this.

14
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,690
Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.

15
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,770
I have claimed many daughters this day...

16
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,440
...so they cannot be mounted.

17
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,990
This is the way of war.

18
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,030
These women are slaves now...

19
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,410
...to do with as we please.

20
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,790
It pleases me to keep them safe.

21
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,920
If your riders would mount them,
let them take them for wives.

22
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,130
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

23
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,140
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

24
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,640
You are a foreigner.

25
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,810
You do not command me.

26
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,810
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

27
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,150
See how fierce she grows?

28
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,610
That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,

29
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,110
filling her with his fire.

30
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,240
I will hear no more.

31
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,870
Mago, find somewhere else
to stick your cock.

32
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,540
A Khal who takes orders
from a foreign whore is no Khal.

33
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,520
I will not have your body burned.

34
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,440
I will not give you that honor.

35
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,070
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

36
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,320
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

37
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,370
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

38
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,010
...until nothing is left of you but bones.

39
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,510
First you have to kill me.

40
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
I already have.

41
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,240
My sun and stars is wounded.

42
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,330
A scratch...

43
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,040
...moon of my life.

44
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,870
Where are the healers?

45
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,960
This is the bite of a fly.

46
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,550
I can help the great rider with his cut.

47
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,590
The Khal needs no help
from slaves who lie with sheep.

48
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,140
She is mine. Let her speak.

49
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,650
Witch.

50
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,410
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.

51
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,220
Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...

52
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,760
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
