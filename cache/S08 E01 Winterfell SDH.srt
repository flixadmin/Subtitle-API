1
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,995
(Panting)

2
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,421
(Pig squeals)

3
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,924
(Donkey brays)

4
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,926
(Chickens squawking)

5
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,095
(Footsteps marching)

6
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,515
(Men shouting indistinctly)

7
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,127
(Horses snorting)

8
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,010
(Man shouts indistinctly)

9
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,446
(Horse neighs)

10
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,588
(Horse whinnies)

11
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,308
(Man shouts indistinctly)

12
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,896
You should consider yourself lucky.

13
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,150
At least your balls won't freeze off.

14
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,069
You take great offense at dwarf jokes,
but love telling eunuch jokes.

15
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,154
Why is that?

16
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,325
Because I have balls, and you don't.

17
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,437
I warned you.

18
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,065
Northerners don't much trust
outsiders.

19
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,905
(Dragon roars)

20
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,657
- (People clamoring)
- (Horses neighing)

21
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
Man: May the gods protect us!

22
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,495
(Dragons roaring)

23
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,999
(Woman screaming)

24
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,253
(Horses neighing)

25
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,399
(Roars)

26
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,962
(Horse snorting)

27
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,592
(Breathing heavily)

28
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,981
Look at you.

29
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
(Sniffles)

30
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,692
You're a man.

31
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,694
Almost.

32
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,008
- Jon: Where's Arya?
- Lurking somewhere.

33
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,392
Jon: Queen Daenerys
of house Targaryen.

34
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,731
My sister, sansa stark,
the lady of winterfell.

35
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,192
Thank you for inviting us
into your home, lady stark.

36
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,403
The north is as beautiful
as your brother claimed,

37
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,030
as are you.

38
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,702
Winterfell is yours, your grace.

39
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,790
We don't have time for all this.

40
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,335
The night king has your dragon.
He's one of them now.

41
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,215
The wall has fallen,
the dead march south.

42
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,639
Sansa: As soon as we heard
about the wall,

43
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,684
I called all our banners
to retreat to winterfell.

44
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:57,936
Lord umber...

45
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,648
When can we expect
your people to arrive?

46
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,031
We need more horses and wagons,
if it please my lady.

47
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,452
And my lord.

48
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,872
And my queen.

49
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,375
Sorry.

50
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,377
Sansa: You'll have
as many as we can spare.

51
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,088
Hurry back to last hearth
and bring your people here.

52
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,716
(People chattering indistinctly)

53
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,802
We need to send ravens
to the night's watch as well.

54
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,280
There's no sense
in Manning the castles anymore.

55
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,806
We make our stand here.

56
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,099
At once, your grace.

57
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,143
"Your grace."

58
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,109
But you're not. Are you?

59
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,779
You left winterfell a king
and came back a...

60
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,034
I'm not sure what you are now.

61
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,243
(People murmuring)

62
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,327
A lord?

63
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,747
Nothing at all?

64
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,996
- It's not important.
- Lady mormont: Not important?

65
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,170
We named you king in the north.

66
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,755
(People exclaiming)

67
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,631
Man: King in the north!

68
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,305
You did, my lady.

69
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,641
It was the honor of my life.

70
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,144
I'll always be grateful
for your faith.

71
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,776
But when I left winterfell, I told you
we need allies or we will die.

72
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,489
I have brought those allies home
to fight alongside us.

73
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,033
I had a choice,

74
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,870
keep my crown or protect the north.

75
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,498
I chose the north.

76
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,416
(People murmuring)

77
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,842
(Chair scrapes)

78
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,264
If anyone survives the war to come,
we'll have Jon snow to thank.

79
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,935
He risked his life
to show us the threat is real.

80
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,978
Thanks to his courage,

81
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,148
we have brought with us the greatest
army the world has ever seen.

82
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,318
We have brought
two full-grown dragons.

83
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,157
And soon, the Lannister army
will ride north to join our cause.

84
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,076
(People grumbling)

85
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,707
I know, I know, our people
haven't been friends in the past.

86
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,962
But we must fight together now...

87
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,880
Or die.

88
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,927
May I ask, how are we meant to feed

89
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,929
the greatest army
the world has ever seen?

90
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,407
While I ensured our stores
would last through winter,

91
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,687
I didn't account for Dothraki,
unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

92
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,440
What do dragons eat, anyway?

93
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,944
Whatever they want.

94
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,033
- (Horse neighs)
- (People chattering indistinctly)

95
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,341
Hey, careful, lads.
We need every last bit of it.

96
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,551
Man 1: Sorry 'bout that.

97
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,807
Are these the last of the wagons?

98
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,975
Man 2: Aye.

99
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,060
Gendry: All right,
let's get it all to the forges.

100
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,737
My lord.

101
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,865
My lady.

102
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
My lady.

103
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,969
The lady of winterfell.

104
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,223
Has a nice ring to it.

105
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,433
So does hand of the queen.

106
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,020
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

107
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,234
Last time we spoke
was at Joffrey's wedding.

108
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,529
- Miserable affair.
- It had its moments.

109
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,621
Apologies for leaving like that.

110
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,373
Yes, it was a bit hard to explain

111
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,000
why my wife fled
moments after the king's murder.

112
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,796
We both survived.

113
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,467
Many underestimated you.

114
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,303
Most of them are dead now.

115
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,856
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
the Lannister army's marching north.

116
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,820
You have every right
to be fearful of my sister.

117
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,674
No one fears her more than I do.
But I promise, you'll be safe...

118
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:06,619
Cersei told you her army
was coming north to fight for you?

119
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,704
She did.

120
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,707
And you believed her?

121
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,587
She has something to live for now.
I believe she wants to survive.

122
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,676
I used to think
you were the cleverest man alive.

123
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,043
Arya: You used to be taller.

124
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,839
Jon: How did you sneak up on me?

125
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,966
How did you survive
a knife through the heart?

126
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,676
I didn't.

127
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
(Chuckles)

128
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,445
- (Arya sighs)
- (Scoffs)

129
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,821
You still have it.

130
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,159
Needle.

131
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,412
Have you ever used it?

132
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,082
Once or twice.

133
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,763
(Jon chuckles)

134
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,349
Valyrian steel.

135
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,269
- Jealous?
- (Scoffs)

136
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,063
Too heavy for me.

137
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,281
Where were you before?

138
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,368
I could've used your help with sansa.

139
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,914
She doesn't like your queen,
does she?

140
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,750
Sansa thinks
she's smarter than everyone.

141
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,045
She's the smartest person
I've ever met.

142
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,173
Now you're defending her? (Chuckles)

143
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,258
You?

144
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,969
I'm defending our family.

145
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,805
So is she.

146
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,056
(Softly) Yeah.

147
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,476
I'm her family too.

148
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,608
Don't forget that.

149
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,661
- (Waves crashing)
- (Birds calling)

150
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,963
Your grace,
I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

151
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,091
The dead have
broken through the wall.

152
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,304
Good.

153
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,674
Why don't you just get it over with
and kill me?

154
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,719
(Sighs) But we're family.

155
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,640
The last greyjoys left in the world.

156
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,767
(Grunts softly)

157
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,896
The last ones with balls anyway.
(Chuckles)

158
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,068
If I kill you...

159
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,862
Who can I talk to?

160
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,784
(Sighs)

161
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,161
I've got a crew full of mutes.

162
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,289
(Sighs)

163
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,208
It gets lonely at sea.

164
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,462
Are we in king's landing?

165
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,130
Euron: Mmm.

166
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,262
You picked the losing side.

167
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,726
Then I'll sail the iron fleet
somewhere else.

168
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,987
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

169
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,867
(Footsteps receding)

170
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,620
(Breathing heavily)

171
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,206
(Door opens and closes)

172
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,335
Cersei: Twenty-thousand men, is it?

173
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,380
Yes, your grace.
A few died in transit.

174
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,134
They cheated at dice.

175
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,387
Or maybe I cheated.

176
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,264
Someone cheated.

177
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,727
They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.

178
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,895
- Horses?
- Two thousand.

179
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,314
And elephants?

180
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,733
Strickland:
Uh, no elephants, your grace.

181
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,819
That's disappointing.

182
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,239
I was told
the golden company had elephants.

183
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,575
Strickland: They are excellent beasts,
your grace,

184
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,536
but not well-suited
to long sea voyages.

185
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,705
In any event, you are most welcome

186
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,082
here in king's landing,
captain strickland.

187
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,336
We look foward to fighting
on your behalf, your grace.

188
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,931
Euron: Am I most welcome here?

189
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,063
You are a true friend of the crown
and an honored guest.

190
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,397
Euron: Good.

191
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,525
As a true friend
and an honored guest...

192
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,239
(Grunts)

193
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,579
(Whispers) I was hoping
we could talk in private.

194
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,832
After the war.
That was our agreement.

195
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,670
Wars sometimes last years.

196
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,798
You want a whore, buy one.

197
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,677
You want a queen...

198
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,804
Earn her.

199
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,350
How?

200
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,730
I've given herjustice, an army
and the iron fleet,

201
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,942
yet she gives me
no sign of affection.

202
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,903
My heart is nearly broken.

203
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,407
You're insolent.

204
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,496
- I've executed men for less.
- They were lesser men.

205
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,189
(Chuckles)

206
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,413
Dirah: I hear the dragon burnt up
a thousand Lannister men.

207
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,165
Craya: Burnt up
some of my favorite boys.

208
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,208
- Dirah: Archie, was it?
- And William.

209
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,503
- Tall handsome William?
- Yeah, tall handsome William.

210
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,747
They said what's left of him
could fit in a wine glass.

211
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,925
I am the only man you ever met
who shot a dragon.

212
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,178
- Did you?
- Bronn: Nearly killed it.

213
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
That's brave.

214
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,559
(Moaning)

215
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,188
(Bronn sighs)

216
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,233
Craya: That boy Eddie...
Dirah: The ginger?

217
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,320
That's him. Came back
with his face burnt right off.

218
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,821
He's got no eyelids now.

219
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,656
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

220
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,140
All right, can we stop talking
about the fucking dragons now?

221
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,641
Qyburn: Ser bronn of the Blackwater.

222
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,331
You're kidding me.

223
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,459
Apologies for the interruption,
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

224
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,755
Sorry, ladies.

225
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,383
Another time perhaps.

226
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,520
You ever get lonely,
I am partial to older gentlemen.

227
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,109
Poor girl. The pox will take her
within the year.

228
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,778
(Coughs)

229
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,006
- Which girl?
- Qyburn: The queen's brothers

230
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
made promises to you and broke them.

231
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,827
Her grace wants to rectify
their mistake.

232
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,749
She once gave me a castle and a wife,
then rectified me right out of them.

233
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,626
That was ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

234
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,005
When queen Cersei wants something,
she pays in advance and in gold.

235
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,841
Several chests of it, in fact.

236
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,052
Waiting for you
in a wagon just outside.

237
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,853
So she wants to murder someone,
but she can't send her soldiers.

238
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,772
If it's the dragon queen
she's after...

239
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,816
She has other plans
for the Targaryen girl.

240
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,110
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

241
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,364
Our queen's brothers are unlikely
to survive their northern adventures.

242
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,741
But in the event that they do...

243
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,835
She has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

244
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,838
That fucking family.

245
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,967
Qyburn: When the citadel expelled me,
I thought I would die poor and alone,

246
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,929
but in exchange for my service,
queen Cersei made me her hand.

247
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,309
What would she do for the man who
rids her of her treasonous brothers?

248
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,991
(Door opens and closes)

249
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,827
(Sighs) I wanted those elephants.

250
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,707
(Euron sighs)

251
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,876
Euron: So...

252
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,590
How do I compare to the fat king?

253
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,384
You're insulting my late husband?

254
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,969
Are you offended?

255
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,351
Robert had a different whore
every night,

256
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,146
but he still didn't know
his way around a woman's body.

257
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,190
And the kingslayer?

258
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,781
You enjoy risking your neck,
dontyou?

259
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,449
(Chuckles)

260
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,784
Life is boring.

261
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,870
You're not boring,
I'll give you that.

262
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,830
(Sighs)

263
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,759
Do I please the queen?

264
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,389
You might be the most arrogant man
I've ever met.

265
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,226
(Whispers) I like that.

266
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,103
(Chuckles)

267
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,271
But now I want to be alone.

268
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,317
(Euron sighs softly)

269
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,656
(Softly) I'm going to put
a prince in your belly.

270
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,754
(Door closes)

271
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,645
(String creaks)

272
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,980
(Flesh squelches)

273
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,276
(Men grunting)

274
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,158
- (Blade swishes)
- (Gasps)

275
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,083
(Panting)

276
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,418
(Gasps)

277
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,309
(Grunts)

278
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,521
(Both grunt)

279
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,920
Yara: Euron can't defend
the iron islands,

280
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,256
not if he's in king's landing
with all his men and his ships.

281
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,051
We can take our home back.

282
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,011
Daenerys went north.

283
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,306
Daenerys will need somewhere to
retreat if they can't hold the north.

284
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,475
Somewhere the dead can't go.

285
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,651
You're my queen.
I go where you command.

286
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,574
You want to go to winterfell.

287
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,118
To fight for the starks.

288
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,879
What is dead may never die.

289
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,968
What is dead may never die.

290
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,142
But kill the bastards anyway.

291
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,072
(People chattering indistinctly)

292
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,963
Wolkan: Welcome back, my lady.

293
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,756
If you'd follow me...

294
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,842
Varys: The karstarks.

295
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,969
Tyrion: One of the better sigils.

296
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,555
Beats an onion, anyway.

297
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,266
Can't argue with that.

298
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,144
Not so long ago,
the starks and the karstarks

299
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,271
were slaughtering each other
on the battlefield.

300
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,398
Jon snow brought peace to the houses.

301
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,841
Tyrion: And our queen is grateful.

302
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,028
Her gratitude is lovely,
but that's not my point.

303
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,948
The northmen are loyal to Jon snow,
not to her.

304
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,116
They don't know her.

305
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,118
The free folk don't know her.

306
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,330
I've been up here a while,
and I'm telling you,

307
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,873
they're stubborn as goats.

308
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,168
You want their loyalty,
you have to earn it.

309
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,932
I sense that you're leading
to a proposal.

310
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,268
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

311
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,688
On the off chance
that we survive the night king,

312
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:56,401
what if the seven kingdoms,
for once in their whole shit history,

313
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,988
were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

314
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,326
Tyrion: They do make
a handsome couple.

315
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,203
Varys: You overestimate our influence.

316
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,456
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen
to lonely old men.

317
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,707
I'm not that old.

318
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,961
Not as old as him.

319
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,128
(Chuckles)

320
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,090
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

321
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,675
Of course she does.

322
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,594
Respect is how the young
keep us at a distance,

323
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,430
so we don't remind them
of an unpleasant truth.

324
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,349
Tyrion: What is that?

325
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,810
Nothing lasts.

326
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,562
Man: Hey!

327
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,481
(Men shouting indistinctly)

328
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,487
Your sister doesn't like me.

329
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,077
She doesn't know you.

330
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,539
If it makes you feel better,

331
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,433
she didn't like me either
when we were growing up.

332
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,543
She doesn't need to be my friend...

333
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,421
But I am her queen.

334
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,593
If she can't respect me...

335
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,679
(Man speaks Dothraki)

336
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,481
How many today?

337
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,400
Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

338
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,655
What's the matter?

339
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,574
(In English)
The dragons are barely eating.

340
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,959
(Dragons growling softly)

341
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,885
Jon: What's wrong with them?

342
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,511
They don't like the north.

343
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,862
Go on.

344
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,953
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

345
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,040
Nobody does.
Until they ride a dragon.

346
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,044
What if he doesn't want me to?

347
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,422
Then I've enjoyed your company,
Jon snow.

348
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,261
(Scoffs)

349
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,229
(Jon grunts)

350
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,026
What do I hold onto?

351
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,862
Whatever you can.

352
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,409
- (Jon grunts)
- (Rhaegal chitters)

353
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,999
(Drogon roars)

354
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,051
(Jon grunts)

355
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,062
(Roars)

356
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,949
(Rhaegal screeches)

357
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,202
(Jon yelps)

358
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,764
(Rhaegal roars)

359
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,976
(Yells)

360
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,648
Jon: Aah!

361
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,659
(Grunts)

362
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,833
(Wind whistling)

363
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,773
You've completely
ruined horses for me.

364
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,149
(Laughs)

365
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,825
We could stay a thousand years...

366
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,329
No one would find us.

367
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,250
We'd be pretty old.

368
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:05,919
(Chuckles)

369
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,593
It's cold up here
for a southern girl.

370
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,388
So keep your queen warm.

371
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,313
(Drogon growls softly)

372
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,153
Don't be afraid.

373
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,332
(Snorts)

374
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,793
Man 1: That's good.

375
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:49,917
(Man 1 speaks indistinctly)

376
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,846
Man 2: Gendry? Man 3: He's here.

377
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,563
It isn't easy making a blade that big
with dragonglass.

378
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,359
You're saying you're good,
is that it?

379
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,163
I'm just saying
it's a tricky material to...

380
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,363
You know who makes weapons
for the wildlings?

381
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,033
Cripples and cocksuckers.

382
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,951
Which one are you?

383
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,244
Arya: Leave him be.

384
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,295
I heard you were here.

385
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,090
You left me to die.

386
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,801
First I robbed you.

387
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,607
You're a cold little bitch,
aren't you?

388
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,987
Guess that's why you're still alive.

389
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,955
That was a nice ax you made for him.

390
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,999
You've gotten better.

391
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,460
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

392
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,130
I mean, you look good.

393
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,926
Thanks. So do you.

394
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,682
It's not a bad place to grow up,
if it wasn't so cold.

395
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,143
Stay close to that forge, then.

396
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,562
Oh, is that a command, lady stark?

397
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,855
Don't call me that.

398
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,024
As you wish, milady.

399
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,779
(Chuckles)

400
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,408
Arya: Here's my wish.

401
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,994
Can you make it?

402
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,220
What do you need
something like this for?

403
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,707
Can you make it or not?

404
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,417
You already have a sword.

405
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,501
What's that?

406
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,634
It's valyrian steel.

407
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,594
I always knew
you were just another rich girl.

408
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,266
You don't know any other rich girls.

409
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,818
(Knock on door)

410
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,902
Come in.

411
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,320
(Door opens)

412
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,284
(Sighs)

413
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,370
Lord glover wishes us good fortune,

414
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,623
but he's staying in deepwood motte
with his men.

415
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,587
"House glover will stand
behind house stark

416
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,589
as we have for a thousand years."

417
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,550
Isn't that what he said?

418
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,386
Sansa: "I will stand
behind Jon snow," he said.

419
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,389
"The king in the north."

420
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,202
- I told you we needed allies.
- Sansa: You didn't tell me

421
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,520
you were going to abandon your crown.

422
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,355
I never wanted a crown.

423
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,150
All I wanted
was to protect the north.

424
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,403
I brought two armies home with me,
two dragons.

425
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,197
And a Targaryen queen.

426
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,950
(Sighs) Do you think we can beat
the army of the dead without her?

427
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,078
I fought them, sansa. Twice.

428
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,080
You want to worry about
who holds what title,

429
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,082
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

430
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,503
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

431
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,758
(Sighs)

432
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,514
Do you have any faith in me at all?

433
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,892
You know I do.

434
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,773
She'll be a good queen.

435
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,025
For all of us.

436
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,153
She's not her father.

437
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,785
(Sighs)

438
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,453
No, she's much prettier.

439
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,746
(Chuckles softly)

440
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:00,046
Did you bend the knee to save
the north or because you love her?

441
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,011
(Door opens)

442
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,440
(Men shouting indistinctly
in distance)

443
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:23,945
(Daenerys clears throat)

444
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,655
Oh!

445
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:29,868
So you're the man?

446
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,830
Which man am I, your grace?

447
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,541
The one who saved ser jorah
when no one else could.

448
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,669
They could, they just wouldn't.

449
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,731
Daenerys: I'll have to
make some changes

450
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,424
in the citadel when I take my throne.

451
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,135
A great service
merits a great reward.

452
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,013
Samwell: Oh, it's my honor
to serve you, your grace.

453
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,515
Daenerys: Well, there must be
something I could give you.

454
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,479
If it's not too much trouble,
I could use a pardon.

455
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,815
For what crime?

456
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,903
I borrowed a few books
from the citadel.

457
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,865
And also a sword.

458
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,868
- From the citadel?
- Samwell: From my family.

459
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,413
It's been in house tarly
for generations.

460
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,832
It would've been mine
anyway, eventually,

461
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,377
but my father had other ideas.

462
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,214
Not randyll tarly?

463
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,051
You know him?

464
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,392
I offered to let him retain his lands
and titles if he bent the knee.

465
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,521
He refused.

466
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,322
(Gulps)

467
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,199
Well...

468
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,413
At least I'll be allowed home again,
now that my brother's the lord.

469
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,920
Your brother stood with your father.

470
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,801
(Breathing shakily)

471
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,686
Hmm.

472
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,480
Thank you, your grace.

473
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,357
For telling me.

474
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,441
And m...

475
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,861
- May I...?
- Of course.

476
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,123
(Door closes)

477
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,375
(Breathing heavily)

478
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,459
(Sniffles)

479
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,216
- (Horse neighs)
- (Whimpers)

480
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,553
(People chattering indistinctly)

481
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,573
What are you doing out here?

482
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,617
Waiting, for an old friend.

483
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,455
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

484
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,665
No, no.

485
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,586
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

486
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,963
I'm not his brother.

487
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,716
He trusts you more than anyone.

488
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,510
Now's the time.

489
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,492
(Jon sighs)

490
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,619
(Man grunting) (Thuds)

491
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,454
(Man groaning)

492
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,172
Jon: Sam?

493
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,717
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

494
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,098
Were you hiding from me?

495
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,224
Of course not.

496
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,976
What are you doing in winterfell?

497
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,938
Or did you read every book
in the citadel already?

498
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,567
What's wrong?

499
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,028
Gilly? Is she all right?

500
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,072
- She's good.
- Little Sam?

501
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,825
Don't you know?

502
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,452
Know what?

503
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,830
Daenerys...

504
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,375
She executed my father and brother.

505
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,293
They were her prisoners.

506
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,091
She didn't tell you.

507
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,518
I'm so sorry.

508
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,565
We need to end this war.

509
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,401
Would you have done it?

510
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,947
Well, I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

511
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,074
You've also spared men.

512
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,536
Thousands ofwildlings
when they refused to kneel.

513
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,120
I wasn't a king.

514
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,498
But you were.

515
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,626
You've always been.

516
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,130
I gave up my crown, Sam.

517
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,758
I bent the knee.
I'm not king in the north anymore.

518
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,361
I'm not talking about
the king in the north.

519
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,971
I'm talking about the king
of the bloody seven kingdoms.

520
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,480
Bran and I worked it out.

521
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,567
I had a high septon's diary.
Bran had...

522
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,361
Whatever bran has.

523
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,654
What are you talking about?

524
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,534
Your mother...

525
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,995
Was lyanna stark.

526
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,496
(Scoffs)

527
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,789
Samwell: And your father...

528
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,626
Your real father

529
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,086
was rhaegar Targaryen.

530
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,798
You've never been a bastard.

531
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,178
You're aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the iron throne.

532
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,560
I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

533
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,156
My father was the most honorable man
I ever met.

534
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,703
You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

535
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,584
Your father... well, ned stark.

536
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,629
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

537
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,632
And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

538
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,177
You're the true king.

539
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:08,432
Aegon Targaryen, sixth of his name,
protector of the realm, all of it.

540
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,186
(Breathing shakily)

541
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,324
- Daenerys is our queen.
- Samwell: She shouldn't be.

542
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,829
- That's treason.
- It's the truth.

543
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,125
You gave up your crown
to save your people.

544
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,877
Would she do the same?

545
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,318
(Soft th u d)

546
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,240
(Footsteps approaching)

547
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,080
(Footsteps growing louder)

548
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,671
(All screaming)

549
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,425
Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

550
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,051
I've always had blue eyes!

551
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,306
(Sighing)

552
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,476
(Grunts)

553
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,271
Did you find anyone?

554
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,972
Dolorous edd: The umber boy.

555
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,099
Beric: It's a message.

556
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,477
From the night king.

557
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,606
His army's between us and winterfell.
We're on foot.

558
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,483
We rode down from castle black.

559
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,776
We can double up on the horses.

560
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,489
If the horses last,
we'll get there before the dead.

561
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,134
We just have to hope
the night king doesn't come first.

562
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,494
-(Shrieking) (Men clamoring)

563
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,019
(Shrieking stops)

564
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,782
(People chattering indistinctly)

565
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,837
Man: Keep moving! Straight up!

566
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,801
Stay together! Don't fall behind!

567
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,485
(Sighs)

568
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,073
(Goat bleating)
