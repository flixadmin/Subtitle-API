00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,895
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

163
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,480
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

164
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,315
Well, think of it this way.

Your school has rules, right?

166

Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

167
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,279
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

168
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,323
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

169
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,825
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

170
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,036
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

171
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,954
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

172
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,374
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

173
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,250
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

174
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,711
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

175
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,588
followed by three years
of probation.

176

activities, technology...

177
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,843
or contact with any
former associates who were...

178
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,222

in violation of said Accords.

00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,225

any contact

187

of time before we get 'em.

188
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,076
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

189
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,079
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

190

And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

191

that any violation
of your agreement

you may have entangled
with her.

It's just the suit.

that suit is how

860
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,294
she goes through walls

No.

That's me. I'm sorry.

00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,639
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

975
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,392
"Cassie, 911."

976
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,478
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

977
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,896
No, that's not happening.

978
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,939
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

979
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,775
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

No, I can't do that right now.

Ava, I want to help you.

1001
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,729
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

Oh, really? How?

1003
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,273
Janet.

1004
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,900
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

1005
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:04,984
absorbing quantum energy.

1006
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,528
We can extract that energy.

1007
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,988
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

1008
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:09,989
Extract it?

1009

- Yes.
- Are you insane?

1010
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,992
That would rip Janet apart.

1011

You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

When Janet's location

1013
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:18,873
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

to the FBI.

They're in the tin. Please.

Look, we'll adjust the relays

while you go reprogram

Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

1053
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,884
to prepare I'd be more ready.

1054

Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

1055
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,514
It kind of melts your mind.

different person?

00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,316
Yeah, like, uh,

I'm serious, Scott.

about me?

00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,098
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1276

1277
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,186
Good news, gentlemen.

1278
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,563
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

- Can you knock?

1282
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,908
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1283
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,869
Ooh, I love leads.

as the tunnel's open...

1288
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,427
let us know
if you get anything

1289
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,469
that could be a part of
her message.

Nothin'.

1297

Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1298
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,464
No.

1299

It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

could it be?

how much time I have.

I need to fix the algorithm.

1309
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,865
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1310
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,700
I've thought about it a lot.

1311

Mom?

1315
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,803
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1316
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,721
It's all so rushed.

1317
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:43,182
You two have done
such great work.

1318
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,309
You just need a little...

1319
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,019
nudge.

1320
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:04,745
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1321
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,706
It wasn't a message you put

1322
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,124
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1323
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,835
Clever girl.

1324
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,337
- I'm so proud of you.
- (CHUCKLES)

1325
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,214
Honey, tell us where you are.

1326
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,966
Tell us how to find you.

1327
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,968
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1328
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,469
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1329
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,054
You have to follow my voice.

1330
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:23,556
Of course!

1331
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,599
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1332

HANK: I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1333
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:36,110
between point two
and point nine.

1334
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,820
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1335
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:39,113
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1336
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,865
Look at us squabbling again.

1337
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,451
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1338
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,997
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

It's you.

HOPE: (LAUGHS) We got it!

1344
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,479
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1345
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,149
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1346
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,483
It's very dangerous,

1347
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,611
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1348

Time and space work very
differently down here.

1349

You have two hours.

1350
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,700
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1351
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:25,826
and it'll be another century

1352
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,369
before they align
like this again.

1354

I know you will, Jellybean.

1355
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,428
Nope.

1356
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,430
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

How did we get up here?

1359
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,691
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1360
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:58,984
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1361
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,862
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

all honestly.

To shrink that wall.

It looks load-bearing.

1525
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,595
The ceiling could collapse.

Then we run like hell.

the lab?

After we lost it
the first time...

1565
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,960
I put on a new tracker...

1566

of sorts.

a lot to do before then.

"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1582
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,493
So, we should do that.

1583
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,787
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1584
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:38,415
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1585
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,709
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1586
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,295
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1587

Let's call it 2-A.

Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1589
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:48,216
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1590
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,593
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1591

I wanted to be his partner.

But he said he wants you.

I had my name

Now, I got this.

a smaller quantum tunnel.

All right. Control's online.

Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.
