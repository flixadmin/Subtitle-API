1
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,629
This is nothing less
than "Zeno's paradox."

2
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:52,719
You are Achilles
and the tortoise is the orgasm.

3
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,722
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, no. Listen.

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,724
Achilles and the tortoise
are going to race,

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,976
and Achilles is confident,

6
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:04,063
so he gives the tortoise
a hundred meters head start.

7
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,191
Now the mathematical problem
is that

8
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,819
before Achilles
can pass the tortoise,

9
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,195
he has to reach the point

10
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,949
where the tortoise started
after a hundred meters.

11
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,369
But when Achilles gets there,
the tortoise has already moved on,

12
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,538
and then he has
to reach the next point,

13
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,165
and the tortoise
has moved on again

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,084
and so on and so on and so on.

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,504
So Achilles can never reach
the tortoise and never pass him.

16
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,842
And in the same way,
because you were giving chase,

17
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,887
you couldn't reach satisfaction.
That's the paradox.

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,432
I'm sorry, but it seems as if you're
not taking this very seriously.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,518
I'm telling you about the worst
thing that's happened to me,

20
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:47,857
that I at that point, within seconds,
lost all sexual sensation.

21
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,276
My cunt simply went numb.

22
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,528
And immediately
we have to hear about

23
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,156
this ridiculous
mathematical problem.

24
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,827
In fact, I'm in doubt
whether you're even listening.

25
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,371
Why do you doubt that?

26
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,795
This is not a story I've told
in its entirety before,

27
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,424
but whenever I've told other men
about experiences,

28
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,636
episodes in my sex life,

29
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,972
it was easy to see
that they became quite excited.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,683
I got excited.

31
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,103
Yes, about the mathematical crap,
not about the story.

32
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,824
What kind of a person
are you, actually?

33
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,039
I...

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,334
You wouldn't know.

35
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,050
No, but I can guess.

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,598
Why didn't I get that earlier?

37
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:07,770
The fact you don't get excited
over my dirty stories

38
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,981
is because you can't relate
to them.

39
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,944
You've never been with a woman.

40
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,209
That's quite accurate.

41
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,712
Not with a man, either.

42
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,556
Are you sorry about that?

43
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:53,649
Well, yeah, out of curiosity...

44
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,279
not out of lust,
as you would think.

45
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:08,998
I consider myself asexual.

46
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,920
Of course, I experimented with
masturbation when I was a teenager,

47
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,341
but it didn't do much for me.

48
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,513
So, there's nothing sexual
about me.

49
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,939
It's not as uncommon
as you would think.

50
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,818
And of course, I've read a lot
about sexual subjects...

51
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:43,157
"Canterbury Tales"," Decameron",
"Thousand and One Nights".

52
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,161
You name it and I've read it
with great interest

53
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,705
and enjoyment,

54
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,583
but only literary enjoyment.

55
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,004
But... but I think
maybe it makes me

56
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,840
a better listener
to your story, and...

57
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:06,764
I have no preconceived notions
or preferences.

58
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,518
I'm actually the best judge
you could give your story to.

59
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,688
And when it comes to deciding whether
you're a bad human being or not,

60
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm... I've no problems with that.

61
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,236
Because I don't look at you
through the glasses

62
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:24,573
colored by sexuality
or sexual experience.

63
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,828
I'm a virgin.

64
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,623
I'm innocent.

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,479
She's looking at me.

66
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,524
Yes.

67
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,486
It's an icon.
Is it Russian?

68
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,988
Yes, it's, uh...

69
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:09,201
It's a skilled copy,
maybe in the manner of Rublev.

70
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,002
Icons are usually connected
to the Eastern Church.

71
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,378
The Eastern Church?

72
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,132
I might become a bit theoretical.

73
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,388
You may. I'd like you to tell me
about your picture.

74
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:34,518
Although the Christian church
was split up in 1054

75
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,020
because of differences in opinion

76
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,939
between the Eastern Church
and the Western Church,

77
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:45,321
what we today call the Orthodox Church
and the Roman Catholic Church,

78
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,116
this is a typical Eastern Church icon.

79
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,286
It usually depicts the Virgin Mary

80
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,455
and the infant Jesus
and more rarely,

81
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,415
for instance, the crucifixion,

82
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,710
which in the Western Church
was much more prevalent.

83
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,339
If you generalize, you could say
that the Western Church

84
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,091
is the church of suffering,

85
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,928
and the Eastern Church
is the church of happiness.

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,391
Why is she looking right at me?

87
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,603
Well, she's telling a story.

88
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,396
Icons were originally a kind of

89
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,525
pictorial Bibles for the illiterate.

90
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,735
There are some who say you...

91
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,447
you read an icon, even write it.

92
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:35,204
There are different types of icons.
This is a Hodegetria.

93
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,706
The directions are very important.

94
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,128
She's looking at you, but she's
pointing at the baby Jesus.

95
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,297
And he's looking at you
and pointing at her.

96
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:51,637
Do you see how flat it is?
There's no... no perspective.

97
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,767
It's because it's an image of eternity.

98
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,563
And eternity isn't in 3-D.

99
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,651
But you said the Eastern Church
was the church of joy?

100
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah, the sanctities
of the Eastern Church

101
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,907
were all about the joy of faith

102
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,953
while the Western Church wallowed
in... in suffering and death.

103
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,499
If you imagine a... a mental
journey from Rome eastward,

104
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,295
you feel how you move away
from guilt and pain

105
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,963
towards joy and light.

106
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,799
But you say
you didn't believe in God.

107
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:34,221
No, but the concept of religion
is interesting.

108
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,600
Like the concept of sex.

109
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,602
But you won't find me
on my knees

110
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,146
with regards to either.

111
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,358
Let's call this chapter,

112
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,403
"The Eastern Church
and the Western Church."

113
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,197
But it won't be...

114
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,617
it won't be a story about
traveling east from Rome

115
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,037
towards the light,
but rather the opposite.

116
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,624
So, in order
not to make it too sad,

117
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,127
I've pepped up the name of
the chapter with an extra title.

118
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,427
I have to go back a bit.

119
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:18,224
I was 12 years old and
on a school trip in the hills.

120
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,386
- Are you making fun of me?
- What do you mean?

121
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,388
You have this orgasm,
not only an orgasm

122
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,891
- but a spontaneous orgasm.
- Yes, it was an orgasm,

123
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,062
though the doctor described it
as an epileptic seizure.

124
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,524
And during that orgasm,
you had this vision?

125
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,486
Of these two women
on each side of you.

126
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,073
The woman on my right side
seemed to be dressed

127
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,409
in purple and scarlet

128
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,578
with a lot of gold and pearls.

129
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,749
She was carrying a golden goblet
in her hand.

130
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,171
She was sitting
on some strange animal.

131
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,051
And then the other woman
was dressed in Roman clothes,

132
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,011
a baby on her arm

133
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:48,100
and her hair lay in tight waves
beneath a veil.

134
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,023
Was she holding the veil
with two fingers like this?

135
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,359
And the other woman,

136
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:02,156
was she sitting on an animal
with seven heads and ten horns?

137
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,827
The animal only had one head.
It was kind of a bull.

138
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,750
What's the matter?

139
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,879
You're making this up.

140
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,466
No, I'm not. I'm telling you
about my first orgasm,

141
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,093
which came upon me
without the slightest touch

142
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,889
in some strange ways
up in the mountains.

143
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,683
I never had achieved
an orgasm before,

144
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,934
even though I masturbated

145
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,021
as if my life depended on it
during that time.

146
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:43,447
Your story is like a...
blasphemous retelling

147
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,618
of the Transfiguration
of Jesus on the Mount,

148
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,748
which is one of the Eastern Church's
holiest passages.

149
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,376
It's when the humanity of Christ
is illuminated

150
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,921
by the divine light of eternity.

151
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,925
Jesus, Peter and two disciples
had climbed a mountain.

152
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,385
And suddenly,
the disciples see this light

153
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,930
emanating from Jesus' head.

154
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,849
And Moses and Elijah
appear by his side.

155
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:15,521
And they hear the voice of God,
calling him his son.

156
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,859
The relationship between...
between the two women and you

157
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,403
would be the same
as the relation

158
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:28,075
between Moses and Elijah
and Jesus.

159
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,869
And that's where
it becomes blasphemous.

160
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,872
I see.

161
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,457
You don't even...

162
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,502
you don't even know who
these women were, do you?

163
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,217
No, but one of them did look
like the Virgin Mary,

164
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,677
now that you mention it.

165
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,762
Well, it wasn't the Virgin Mary,
I can tell you that.

166
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,431
From your description,

167
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,976
it must've been
Valeria Messalina,

168
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,520
the wife of Emperor Claudius,

169
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,315
the most notorious nymphomaniac
in history.

170
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,445
I thought she looked
like your icon.

171
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,740
We have that image
from a statue in the Louvre.

172
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:14,162
It's made like a Hodegetria, but it's
not a religious person, far from it.

173
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,084
And the other woman,
the one astride the creature,

174
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,170
that was no one else
but the great Whore of Babylon,

175
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,258
riding on Nimrod
in the form of a bull.

176
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,973
If anyone else
would've told me that story,

177
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,101
I would've seen it
as a blasphemous joke,

178
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,936
spiced up with a Biblical light

179
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,566
emanating from nothing less
than a spontaneous orgasm.

180
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,653
Goodness gracious.

181
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,531
You demand a lot
of your listener.

182
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,202
I promise you I'm as innocent
in regards to the religious

183
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,331
as you are when it comes to sex.

184
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,960
The Transfiguration
on the Venus Mount.

185
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,759
And then later,
you lost your orgasm altogether.

186
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,014
#  #

187
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,475
Wagner. "Das Rheingold".

188
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:21,104
The descent into Nibelheim.
Was it that bad?

189
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,441
Try to imagine that
in one fell swoop,

190
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,818
you lost all desire to read

191
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,322
and all your love and passion
for books and letters.

192
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,367
I don't even know
if I can imagine that.

193
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,265
Can I help you?

194
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,045
#  #

195
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,455
But as so often before in my life,

196
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:06,084
a bit of hope sprang
from a mystical event.

197
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,419
Which was?

198
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,174
Three dead leaves
performing a strange ballet.

199
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,428
That gave you hope?
For what?

200
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:21,016
- For regaining my sexuality.
- How?

201
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,937
To claim it by force.

202
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,468
In spite of my tireless efforts,

203
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,888
my cunt totally failed to respond.

204
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,642
But the fact
that the initiative had shifted

205
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,686
seemed to encourage Jerome greatly.

206
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,730
And I have to admit
there came a time

207
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,691
when we had fun together.

208
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,823
I'll give you a fiver.

209
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,991
Uh-huh.

210
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,119
If you can put this...

211
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,622
up inside your cunt.

212
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,292
- A fiver?
- Right.

213
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,933
Shit.

214
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,562
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

215
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,611
- Didn't you get any spoons?
- No, we didn't.

216
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,920
So what does this tell us?

217
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,173
That love and sex have nothing
to do with each other, or...

218
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,259
or that they decidedly
work against one another?

219
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,680
The most grotesque thing
was that it was during that period,

220
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:51,059
where every sexual sensation
was denied me, a period,

221
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:55,021
I must admit, of secure
and restful domestic comfort.

222
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,024
We had moved in together
and so on,

223
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,609
that I became pregnant,

224
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,737
because I was careless
about my birth control pills.

225
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,907
Consciously or unconsciously,

226
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,077
it was important for me
to have a Caesarean.

227
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,205
I mean, I was hoping that my cunt
was going to fucking work again,

228
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,084
and I had a feeling
that a haphazard birth

229
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,087
wouldn't make things better.

230
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,464
I may have been imagining things,

231
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,676
but as I lay there,
the noise from the instruments

232
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,221
rang out in a chord like
the one from the Little Flock.

233
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,309
Yes. And it wasn't fear.

234
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,022
More like a kind of disgust.

235
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,456
I could've sworn
I saw him laughing.

236
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,666
A laughing son.

237
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,418
In "Doctor Faustus",
Thomas Mann describes

238
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,087
the birth of Noah's son Ham,

239
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,048
who was laughing when he was born.

240
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,718
Another satanic omen.

241
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,477
Incidentally, the innocent child
was named Marcel after Mars,

242
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,020
the Roman God of War.

243
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,272
And motherhood?

244
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,651
I assume maternal love didn't
quite live up to its expectations.

245
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,529
No, I didn't have
any expectations.

246
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,324
And maternal love
wasn't a problem.

247
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,912
It was just that each time
I looked into the child's eyes,

248
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:39,167
I had this unsettling feeling
of having been found out.

249
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,840
It's probably
a strange thing to say about a child...

250
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,260
that my love wasn't being returned.

251
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,388
But it was my perception.

252
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,644
If Jerome had hoped for a break
from what was for him

253
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:01,606
now mostly strenuous work,
he could forget about it.

254
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,485
Achilles was again chasing
the tortoise.

255
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,033
- Fill all my holes.
- I can't, Joe.

256
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,498
I'm sorry.

257
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,044
I'm trying.

258
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,011
- Can we talk a bit?
- Of course.

259
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:42,021
I love you. I love your wildness
and your desire. I love you, Joe.

260
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,067
At the moment,
I don't seem to satisfy you

261
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,319
in the way that I'd like to.

262
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,488
Don't get upset, Joe.

263
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,157
It doesn't mean we won't continue
with our sex life,

264
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,659
which is very important to me.

265
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,163
Very important to me.

266
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,168
When you buy a tiger, right,

267
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,295
you also have to feed it.

268
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:10,133
Um, satisfy it, right?

269
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,142
Long story short.

270
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,269
I have a tiger on my hands.

271
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,980
- You mean I'm too much for you.
- No.

272
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,608
You're just the way you should be.

273
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,443
I was just thinking
if you would consider

274
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,654
that I get a little help
with the feeding, that's all.

275
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,661
You're saying I should have sex
with others as well.

276
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:49,172
That's a rather cruel way
of putting it, Joe, but...

277
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,716
- But exact.
- Exact.

278
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,189
For a long time I'd
been playing around with the idea

279
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,691
that the concept of
the fuck-me-now clothes

280
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,984
could be improved.

281
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,779
You look nice.

282
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,074
And became the piano teacher.

283
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,891
- You okay?
- No.

284
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,894
- What's the matter?
- Well, I'm such an idiot with cars.

285
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,146
I don't really know what to do.
Do you mind helping me?

286
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,860
Of course it won't work. The
spark plug caps have been removed.

287
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,990
Yes, I did that.
Was that wrong?

288
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,200
For the first time
I had the pleasure

289
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,244
of having an eight-cylinder car.

290
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,162
The possible combinations

291
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,207
of eight spark plug caps
on eight spark plugs

292
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,127
are 40,320,

293
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,005
if I remember
my math correctly.

294
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,675
And only one of these
will make the car run,

295
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,052
which gave me
all the time I needed.

296
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,139
Beethoven, huh?
He was certainly very good,

297
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,016
but, you know,
he couldn't write a fugue.

298
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:27,937
- You think so?
- Well, yeah, I think so.

299
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,606
#  #

300
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,414
It would be more precise
to say that Beethoven

301
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,167
renewed the fugue.

302
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,880
That he was such a visionary
that the old Bach purists,

303
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,216
they accused him
of not mastering it.

304
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,449
Good day?

305
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,085
Not one word was ever spoken

306
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,546
between me and Jerome
about my piano lessons.

307
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,687
The first time the
mysterious letters

308
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,897
addressed to me arrived,

309
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,691
I, of course, feared that
they were love letters

310
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,070
from someone I'd completely
forgotten about and hid them,

311
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,074
so as not to hurt Jerome
if he should see them.

312
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,292
But as Jerome was always somehow
present when I would get the mail,

313
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,629
and as the envelopes
were always empty,

314
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,840
I understood that the letters,
in fact,

315
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,010
were sent by Jerome himself
as a way of testing me.

316
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,931
My decision not to
show them to him

317
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,684
was exactly the reaction
he had feared,

318
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,687
and it reaffirmed
his insane jealousy

319
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:36,315
and his fantasies
of the countless times

320
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,027
I would fall in love for real
while being the piano teacher.

321
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,535
#  #

322
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,433
And now to reach the heart

323
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,518
of your suffering Western Church,

324
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,897
I have to jump ahead
three years in the story

325
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,192
and talk about my meeting
with what I would call

326
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610
"The Dangerous Men."

327
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,077
I was alone with Marcel a lot
during this period,

328
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,122
as Jerome was traveling
most of the time,

329
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,042
and when he was finally home,
he spent most of the time

330
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,711
accusing me of neglecting Marcel,

331
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,213
which, in my opinion,

332
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,633
was just a cover for
his anger over my lovers.

333
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,262
Despite my, to put it mildly,
promiscuous initiatives,

334
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,891
any sexual satisfaction,
let alone orgasm,

335
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,353
was further away than ever before.

336
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,249
I had to make a change.

337
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,292
And somehow,
the inspiration had been

338
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,088
right there beneath my window
the whole time.

339
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,591
I'd planned to go where
I would never before

340
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,677
had dreamt of going.

341
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:33,140
For instance, to be with a man with
whom I shared no spoken language.

342
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,102
I could feel that
it turned me on enormously

343
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,146
to imagine a sexual situation

344
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,859
in which verbal communication
was impossible.

345
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,197
- Hello.
- Hello.

346
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,283
I'm Tobias, the interpreter.

347
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,910
Hello, I'm Joe. Come in.

348
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,746
I understand that you mastered
the African languages.

349
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,708
I do have a basis.

350
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,835
Who and what needs
interpretation?

351
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:06,215
Um, that man.
The one with the green jacket.

352
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,884
What language is being spoken?

353
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,720
Well, God knows. I...

354
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,931
All I know is that
he doesn't speak English.

355
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,952
It's quite difficult.

356
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,206
But, uh, we did manage
to find a dialect,

357
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,833
of which we both
had some knowledge.

358
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:41,917
Mm-hm.

359
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,338
You coming?

360
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,132
No, I'll stay here,
and the two of you communicate.

361
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,596
You are to ask him if he wants
to have sex with me.

362
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,223
- Sex?
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,645
Yeah, um...

364
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,005
- Is it a go?
- It's hard to say.

365
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:33,969
I've written down
the time and place, but, um...

366
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,972
Honestly, I wouldn't like
to take responsibility

367
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,267
for the precise wording
in this case, which I think,

368
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,688
uh, accidentally may belong

369
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,066
to a grey zone in my profession.

370
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,487
It was the address of
a cheap hotel.

371
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,497
Why were there two?

372
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,499
My words exactly.

373
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,586
Apparently, N had brought
his brother along.

374
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,036
Why was he so angry?

375
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,831
Clearly, it was something
personal between them,

376
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,709
but later I heard that
performing a sandwich

377
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,087
requires great sensitivity,
since the men apparently

378
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,756
can feel each other
through the tissue.

379
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,343
I imagine the quarrel had
already started on the stairs

380
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,597
and that one or the other party
had laid claim

381
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,724
to one or the other of my holes

382
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,394
in conflict with his Negro
brother's interests.

383
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,230
You shouldn't use that word.

384
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,233
It's not what you call
politically correct.

385
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,443
Negro.

386
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,404
Well, excuse me,
but in my circles,

387
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,282
it's always been a mark of honor
to call a spade a spade.

388
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,411
Each time a word becomes prohibited,

389
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,122
you remove a stone
from the democratic foundation.

390
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:35,002
Society demonstrates its impotence
in the face of a concrete problem

391
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,087
by removing words
from the language.

392
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,841
The book burners have nothing
on modern society.

393
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,092
I think society would claim

394
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,971
that politically correctness
is a very precise expression

395
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,891
of democratic concern
for minorities.

396
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:54,063
And I say that society is
as cowardly as the people in it

397
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,108
who, in my opinion, are also
too stupid for democracy.

398
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,822
I understand your point,
but I totally disagree.

399
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,449
I have no doubt
in the human qualities.

400
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,454
The human qualities can be
expressed in one word:

401
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,705
hypocrisy.

402
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:16,460
We elevate those who say
right but mean wrong,

403
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,463
and mock those who say
wrong but mean right.

404
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,926
Society is based on hate.

405
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,428
It should be based
on forgiveness.

406
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,391
Hatred is rudimentary.

407
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:36,063
One should be able
to forgive one's executioner.

408
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,945
By the way, I can assure you

409
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:47,324
that women who claim that Negros
don't turn them on are lying.

410
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,160
So, did they satisfy you?

411
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,037
Those Ne... Negros.

412
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:58,460
No, but they showed me that
there was a world far from mine

413
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,921
I had to explore.

414
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,133
And there, or perhaps
on the other side

415
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,010
get my life back.

416
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,558
Who are you?

417
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,145
I know what you do.

418
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,399
I'd like to be
one of the women you see.

419
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,363
That's of no interest.

420
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,996
Madame.

421
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,678
Princess,
I specifically said five days,

422
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,098
and five days haven't gone yet.

423
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:22,104
So, you'll have to leave.
Sorry.

424
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,241
You still here?

425
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,495
I, uh...

426
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,874
I don't think this is for you.

427
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:49,381
Shall we conduct a small test?

428
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,553
Stand up.

429
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,605
Sit down, please.

430
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:18,368
I just want you to sit
completely relaxed

431
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,121
while I hit you in the face.

432
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,998
Nothing special.

433
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:27,502
It's just a...
it's just a slap.

434
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,676
You ready?

435
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,180
I'm ready.

436
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,147
No!

437
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,735
See?

438
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,207
How mysterious.

439
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,252
Will you give me
a reasonable explanation now,

440
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,671
or shall we wait?

441
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,341
I can't give you an explanation

442
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,594
and certainly not a reasonable one.

443
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:22,140
What exactly were the rumors
about him?

444
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,812
- That he was violent.
- How can that be exciting?

445
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,734
I think the easiest way
to understand it

446
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,529
is to refer to my rebellious nature.

447
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:42,202
This business of K's was something
I was completely against.

448
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,288
So, the fact
that I was now contacting him

449
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,249
was a last, desperate attempt

450
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,502
to rehabilitate my sexuality.

451
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,840
The system was
the overriding factor with K.

452
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,843
A system of violence?

453
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,638
Well, you were the one

454
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,559
who insisted on
the Western Church, right?

455
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,103
And I... I seem to remember

456
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,399
that the systematic approach
to the crucifixion

457
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,153
is of a violent
and not to say sadistic nature.

458
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,324
Oh yes, the Passion of Christ
is full of systematic violence.

459
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,201
The Via Dolorosa,
the Nine Stations of the Cross,

460
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,038
and the 39 lashes.

461
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,981
You are beginning
to irritate me.

462
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,764
Let me tell you the rules, then.

463
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,143
The first rule
is that I don't fuck you,

464
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,356
and there isn't any discussions
about that.

465
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,609
Then, what do you get out of it?

466
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:42,614
That's my business, and I don't
mean to mention it again.

467
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:46,451
The second rule
is that we have no safe word,

468
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,163
meaning that if you,
uh, go inside with me,

469
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,083
there is nothing that you can say

470
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:58,296
that will make me stop
any plan or procedure.

471
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:03,468
You must bring a brown,
used leather riding crop.

472
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:08,723
And not one
from a shop selling sex toys.

473
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,517
It's not a masquerade.

474
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,188
Third rule...

475
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:21,278
If I choose to let you in,
you have to be sitting out here.

476
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:25,991
In other words, you...
you won't know when.

477
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,705
Only that it would be some time
between 2:00 and 6:00 at night.

478
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,790
I can't stay here that late.

479
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,752
My babysitter's not reliable,
and I can't leave my child.

480
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,048
You don't even know my name!

481
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,634
I'm not interested in your name.

482
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,555
Here, your name is...

483
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,934
Fido.

484
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,241
Can I help you?

485
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,994
I'd like to buy a riding crop.

486
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,498
- For what?
- For my horse.

487
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,083
Yes, I understand that part.
What kind of horse?

488
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,506
Well, it's not very big.

489
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,133
No, I just meant is the whip
for dressage or for jumping?

490
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,219
Um...

491
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,970
I don't know.

492
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,599
This is a dressage whip.

493
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,601
Well, it's probably
for jumping, then.

494
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,811
Okay. Like this?

495
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,817
- Is it used?
- No.

496
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,738
We do have used whips,
but these are not that expensive.

497
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,242
I prefer a used one.

498
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,162
Okay.

499
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,047
Marcel’s awake.

500
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,591
Do you want to say goodbye
to your mom?

501
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,135
Goodbye.

502
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:29,823
#  #

503
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,696
Fido...

504
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,803
I'll take your coat.

505
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,618
I'd like you
to have your hair up.

506
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:00,622
You can use this.

507
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,584
Just in case it becomes necessary
for me to hit you in the face.

508
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,253
Should I take my clothes off?

509
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:12,050
I'll tell you
what to do and when.

510
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,595
You may sit down.

511
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,774
Give me your hand.

512
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,575
I wanna see what this knot
looks like on your wrist.

513
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,719
Okay.

514
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,561
You may get up.

515
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,738
- Now you may bend down.
- How?

516
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,908
Approach the chair.

517
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,328
Now bend from the hips.

518
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,460
Look forward. Look forward.
With your head up.

519
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,504
Head up.
Keep looking forward.

520
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,305
Keep looking forward.

521
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,686
You may stand up.

522
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,273
We have to use the couch.

523
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,652
Come and sit.

524
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:01,034
Take it easy. Take it easy.

525
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,911
Bend over.

526
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,707
Lay your arms out straight.

527
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,553
Take it easy. Take it easy.

528
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,014
Bring your hands out straight.

529
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,433
Palms facing each other.

530
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,068
Take it easy.

531
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,316
Next time, don't wear knickers.

532
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,094
Your ass is not high enough.

533
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,429
I don't think
we can do this today.

534
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,181
What?

535
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,106
I'd like to see you again
on Thursday.

536
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,574
What's wrong?

537
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,410
I think we should see
how it goes on Thursday.

538
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,175
Hi, I can't
come to the phone right now.

539
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,511
Please, leave a message.

540
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,514
Yes, this is Marcel’s mother again.

541
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:14,060
It's now 1:30.
We had an agreement.

542
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:18,773
I hope you get this message
and come as quickly as you can.

543
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,194
Ah, Marcel is sleeping.

544
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:27,490
Uh... I have to go now.

545
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,256
Raise yourself up.

546
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,094
Even further.

547
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,433
Better.

548
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,540
Also so much better.
So much better.

549
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,800
I am now going to hit you 12 times,

550
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,135
no matter how much you scream

551
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,513
'cause no one can hear you
down here.

552
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:24,732
That's, uh, that's not how it goes.

553
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,070
Most people don't scream
until I hit them.

554
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,550
That's it.

555
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:40,308
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

556
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,654
Hello? Are you there?

557
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,577
It's just all so very strange.

558
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:03,497
Yes. Very, very strange.

559
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:09,503
Because I was wetter the second time.
There's no doubt about it.

560
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,548
I don't know where we get
our sexuality from

561
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,802
or where tendencies
of this kind come from.

562
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,932
Probably a perversion created
in our childhood

563
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,392
that never manifested itself before.

564
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,980
Well, oddly enough,
Freud says the opposite.

565
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,692
He talks about the polymorphic
perversion of a child,

566
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,989
meaning that in a child,
all kinds of perversions exist.

567
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,326
And then we use
the childhood to diminish

568
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,079
or remove some of them.

569
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:46,540
Basically, a child
is sexually polymorphic,

570
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,336
and everything is sexuality
in an infant.

571
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,631
And yet it was deeply bizarre

572
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:57,677
to lie there and especially
to want to lie there.

573
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,934
I felt invincible.

574
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,770
But mostly,
I felt like a potted plant.

575
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:10,982
Potted plant?

576
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,194
Yes, because he was constantly
checking my cunt juice.

577
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:20,324
The way old ladies check their potted
plant to see if they need watering.

578
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:27,206
It is an interesting point
that you actually lubricated

579
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:31,460
in expectation for a pain
that you hadn't experienced.

580
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:36,340
Your body prepared itself
for an intercourse

581
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,926
that you knew wouldn't happen.

582
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,515
I can only describe
the mood as sexual.

583
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,061
Despite K's immature appearance,

584
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:53,399
his methods were
surprisingly refined.

585
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:58,070
As I twisted and turned
while he was whipping me,

586
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,991
I could feel
how clever his knots were.

587
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,828
If I fought them,
they would get tighter,

588
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,915
and as I relaxed,
it seemed they did, too.

589
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,668
Hmm.

590
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:16,589
Like a cat playing with a mouse.

591
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,343
Fooling it to believe
it has a chance of escape

592
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,971
and then attacking it again.

593
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:31,562
I don't know
what kind of knot K used,

594
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:36,984
but I know of a knot that tightens
when force is exerted

595
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,904
and vice versa.
It's called a Prusik knot.

596
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,948
It's after a man called Prusik.

597
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,950
He was a mountain climber,

598
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,786
and he and a friend
were out climbing

599
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:51,290
and they had an accident,
and his friend died.

600
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,710
And he ended up hanging
at the end of a rope

601
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:58,381
with no possibility
of getting up.

602
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,175
You know, you can't climb
up a mountain climber rope.

603
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,135
It's too thin.

604
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,680
But he was an intelligent man,
and with his back to the wall,

605
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,682
he was a genius.

606
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,646
And he took the shoelaces
out of his boots

607
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:17,942
and made two loops
and affixed them to the rope.

608
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,444
And he could move these up

609
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:21,862
when they weren't under tension.

610
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,323
And then he could step into them

611
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:28,577
and climb the rope
and save himself.

612
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,871
Prusik.

613
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,211
I think this was
one of your weakest digressions.

614
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,803
- May I continue?
- Be my guest.

615
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:54,520
Tomorrow bring 15 small coins,
all the same.

616
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,524
No more, no less.

617
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,579
#  #

618
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,815
I sometimes give a Christmas present.

619
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:07,236
But uh, you have
to do the work yourself.

620
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,114
I'm going to show you how to do it.

621
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,047
This is called a blood knot.

622
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:31,594
You have to make nine ropes
with three blood knots on each.

623
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,596
Let me see you do it.

624
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:38,434
You decide whether
to make four, five, or six turns

625
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,603
on the various knots.

626
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,532
Let me see.

627
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,958
That's fine.

628
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:06,253
If you... if you start with one knot

629
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:09,173
at the top of the rope,

630
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:14,136
and then you have to put two
more knots at a distance of...

631
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,432
Well, between 10 and 20
centimeters to be exact,

632
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,184
but the most important thing
with blood knots

633
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,437
on the nine ropes is
that they are placed differently

634
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,981
and that they are staggered.

635
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,740
The cat-o-nine-tails
is often called

636
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,785
the "Captain's Daughter"
aboard ships.

637
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,916
The blood knot is important

638
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:46,835
because those are the ones
that break the skin and not,

639
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:53,217
as erroneously thought,
the end of the rope.

640
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:59,223
A gallows knot is also a kind of
a blood knot with many turns.

641
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:03,894
The American military standard
demanded five to 15 turns,

642
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,106
as it was the turns placed behind
the left ear of the delinquent

643
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,484
that would break the neck
of the condemned as he fell.

644
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,823
I'll take it from here.

645
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,737
#  #

646
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,203
Joe?

647
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,623
Love?

648
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:23,093
Marcel?

649
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,390
Marcel.

650
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,266
- Are you fond of me still?
- Yes.

651
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,394
More fond of me than the others?

652
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:19,232
- Yes?
- Yes.

653
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,111
You're not thinking of leaving
again tonight, are you?

654
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,488
- No.
- No?

655
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,115
- No, no. Not at all.
- You sure?

656
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,826
Yeah.

657
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,746
Are you lying to me, Joe?

658
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,790
- No.
- Be honest.

659
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:39,461
It's all right.
Just fucking say it.

660
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,964
No, I... I just want to be here.

661
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,966
Why?

662
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,638
I don't know.

663
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,981
If you leave tonight,

664
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,693
you'll never see me or Marcel
ever again in your life.

665
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,407
You understand?

666
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,109
Is this goodbye?

667
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,365
Is that what you're saying?

668
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,825
Marcel, get up.

669
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,119
- Stop it.
- Is that what you want?

670
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,291
Yeah, so you could see him.
Look at him, Joe.

671
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:49,800
Let's face it,
Joe, you're not a mother.

672
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,428
Let's wake him up.

673
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:57,933
Marcel, baby boy.
Say bye, Mom.

674
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,728
- Please, put him...
- Is this what you want?

675
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,234
You see?

676
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,445
You see, he wants you.

677
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,447
Come.

678
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,493
It's Christmas.
It's fucking Christmas.

679
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,642
What is this?

680
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:45,939
Today it's Madame who must wait.

681
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,158
Madame, I'm very sorry,

682
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,286
but I have to have a few words
with Fido first.

683
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,716
Your behavior is really
upsetting me today.

684
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,313
I really ought to send you home.

685
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,295
Happy Christmas, Fido.

686
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,277
- I want your cock.
- What did you say?

687
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,321
I want your cock.

688
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:02,075
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

689
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,580
What's the matter with you today?

690
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:34,858
On account of the holidays
and your behavior today,

691
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:37,319
I'm going to give you
the original Roman maximum

692
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,488
of 40 lashes.
Are you ready, Fido?

693
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,242
I'm ready.

694
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,333
One.

695
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:54,627
Two.

696
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:57,964
Three.

697
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,926
Four.

698
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,387
Five.

699
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,099
Six.

700
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,823
I'd seen through K's
knot technique,

701
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:26,493
so I was able to loosen
my position a bit

702
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,329
to move my pelvis
and thereby stimulate

703
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:32,207
my clitoris against the cover
of the book.

704
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,261
#  #

705
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,067
Forty.

706
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:14,791
And when you came home,
Jerome and the child were gone?

707
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:24,676
I haven't seen Marcel since.

708
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:32,809
This sentimentality...
I hate it.

709
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:39,482
- Why?
- Because it's a lie.

710
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,613
Are you sure?

711
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,622
Jerome understood
that he couldn't prioritize

712
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:59,502
his life according to a child either,

713
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,630
so he put him in a foster home.

714
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,386
My only contact to the boy
is the thousand pounds

715
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,473
I put in his account every month.

716
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,099
Anonymously.

717
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,480
As a penance.

718
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,616
Every time I leave,

719
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:33,745
I have this feeling that
when I return, you'll be gone.

720
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,542
And all I can hear
is the cat flap,

721
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,171
swinging back and forth.

722
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:49,385
Thank you. I didn't know
you had a cat flap.

723
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,387
I used to have a cat,

724
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,891
so I have a cat flap
in the door to the stairwell.

725
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,851
But how did it get outside?

726
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:04,192
I never thought of that.
I suppose through the basement.

727
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,069
The thing is...

728
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:09,072
Every time someone opens
the door to the street,

729
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,325
the cat flap squeaks.

730
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,327
There's a lot of drafts
in the house.

731
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,623
It hasn't squeaked yet.

732
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,961
No, there's not many people
coming and going.

733
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,088
That's a bit creepy.

734
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:28,466
No, I like it.

735
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,512
It's... it's peaceful.

736
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:42,522
After all this sadness, may I ask
what happened to the silent duck?

737
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,485
Oh, shit. The silent duck.

738
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,405
I'd forgotten all about it.

739
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,117
One night K had been
in what was for him

740
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,202
an unusually good mood.

741
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,871
I don't know what caused it,
but he didn't hit hard,

742
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,165
and he joked that
he would introduce me

743
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,168
to the concept
of the silent duck.

744
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:33,406
One hardly dare
imagine the quacking duck.

745
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,631
Well, deep down,

746
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,967
little K seems
to have been a jolly man

747
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:54,344
with versatile talents.

748
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:58,264
But he got that bit
about Roman punishment

749
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,850
and the 40 lashes wrong.

750
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,644
Because it's true that
the highest punishment

751
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:07,815
was 40 lashes, but it had to be
delivered in series of three.

752
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,859
That's why Jesus
only got 39 lashes

753
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:15,657
because three goes
into 39 but not into 40.

754
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,746
Well, I don't know about K
being jolly.

755
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,374
His position as a sadist

756
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,669
wasn't perhaps as enviable
as it might first appear.

757
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:32,882
Superficially, the sadist
acts as the decider.

758
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,636
But I once had a conversation
with a prostitute,

759
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:39,263
who had tried all the variations
in her field.

760
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,057
She wasn't surprised by anything.

761
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:46,104
And she admitted to have only
masochists.

762
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,147
Masochists, for her,

763
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,275
were the most demanding
and the most ungrateful.

764
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,654
First, she were
to deduce their desire

765
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,531
by reading their thoughts,

766
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:00,660
then perform without
any alteration from the norm,

767
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,996
and after which,
unlike other clients

768
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:07,500
and the most honorable sadists,
for example,

769
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,585
you never received any thanks,

770
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,297
let alone gifts or flowers.

771
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:20,722
I never went
in that direction again,

772
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,349
neither back to K or masochism.

773
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,362
But I took the orgasm with me.

774
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:42,326
You yet have to show me one
single example of maliciousness.

775
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,538
But that's all I'm doing!

776
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:48,499
It's as if you want
to misunderstand me.

777
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:52,295
You keep inventing
complicated and false excuses

778
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,922
for my despicable
and selfish actions.

779
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:58,968
During the time
when our relationship

780
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,929
was going downhill,
Jerome really tried his best.

781
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,726
I bought you something.

782
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:08,644
- You bought me something?
- I'm sure you'll love it.

783
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,107
- Wow, it's a ring.
- Yeah.

784
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,193
It's beautiful.

785
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,488
It was impossible
for me to work out Jerome's income.

786
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,533
Sometimes he had lots of money
and other times none,

787
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,951
which I later thought perhaps

788
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,413
meant that his work
was not entirely above board.

789
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,666
But this time
he'd really gone all out.

790
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:35,379
- That must've been so expensive.
- Well, it wasn't cheap.

791
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,632
- Best craftsmanship.
- Hmm.

792
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,009
I'll guarantee you that.

793
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,595
Let's play a game, then.

794
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:45,014
- A game?
- Mm-hmm. Get up.

795
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,265
Okay.

796
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,643
- It's called "Cinderella".
- I don't know it.

797
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,686
- You will.
- Okay.

798
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,730
- Right.
- No, you don't touch it.

799
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,440
- Okay.
- You just look at it.

800
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,694
Okay? Are you ready?

801
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,864
- Yes.
- Steady.

802
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,325
Steady.

803
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,244
- Go.
- Fuck! Joe!

804
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,620
Come on, Cinderella.

805
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:10,248
- Oh, fuck.
- Come on, come on.

806
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,709
Joe! For fuck's sake.

807
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,045
- Move!
- Cinderella, Cinderella!

808
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,298
Fuck! Are you mad, Joe?

809
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,010
Are you fucking mad?
Fuck! Fuck.

810
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,097
£7,000, Joe!

811
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,267
Did he find it?

812
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:34,313
Oh yes, and returned it
and got all his money back.

813
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:39,068
So can you call this game
anything other than malicious?

814
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,617
Let me chew on that for a while.

815
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:53,666
So it wasn't the diamond that
you're wearing around your neck?

816
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:57,128
No. But that was a gift, too.

817
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,213
But I have to be honest and say

818
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:02,174
I can't remember the person
who gave it to me.

819
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,095
I've always been in...
in the theoretical way, of course,

820
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:08,264
interested in diamonds
and their cuts.

821
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,309
The word "brilliant"
refers to the cut.

822
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:14,228
Diamond is the stone.

823
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:18,190
If we use the word "divine"
in connection

824
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,443
with the Golden Section
and Fibonacci,

825
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,737
the brilliant cut is nothing less.

826
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,657
It's a frighteningly refined cut.

827
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,410
Fifty-seven facets.

828
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:32,747
The theory is that the light
enters through the top plane,

829
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:37,168
which is called the table
or in some languages the mirror,

830
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:41,464
and then inside the diamond
is refracted in all the facets

831
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:43,466
and thrown out the same way,

832
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:48,638
creating a absolutely unique
light effect.

833
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,477
So, it's called a mirror.
I didn't know that.

834
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,480
You have a mirror, too.

835
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,651
Yeah.

836
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,236
It's like a thought, isn't it?

837
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,142
Some years later,

838
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,521
the bodily abuse
began to have an effect.

839
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:42,024
First, rare bleedings
from my clitoris,

840
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,569
but then they became
more and more frequent.

841
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:56,872
Come in.

842
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,213
But I really need my salary.

843
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:05,965
I know.

844
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,885
And I'd like to help you.

845
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:13,973
Have you heard any
of the rumors about yourself?

846
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,229
They say you see men
every evening

847
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:26,110
and spend all night with them.

848
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,530
They say you can't be trusted,
all of them.

849
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,160
Why do they say that?

850
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,706
I suppose they're afraid
that I...

851
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:42,376
I can't keep away
from their men.

852
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:47,381
Right. And can you?

853
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,009
No.

854
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,598
I've spoken with a psychologist.

855
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,809
He says you're addicted,

856
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,562
but that it's not the kind of
addiction that can't be treated.

857
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:05,274
They have some groups.

858
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:07,943
I know about these kinds
of groups.

859
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:11,155
I don't have anything
to say to a psychologist.

860
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,325
I'm not suggesting therapy.
I'm demanding it.

861
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,912
Even if you leave us,
it'll be the same at your next job

862
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,539
and the one after that.

863
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:27,963
Why didn't you want to speak
with a psychologist?

864
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,802
It's an old story.
I just don't like them.

865
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,973
Well, if you insist
that I try to understand,

866
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,267
then you have
to tell me that story as well.

867
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,728
The old story.

868
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,816
Okay. Okay.

869
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:49,401
It's not that old after all.

870
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:54,657
It was about a year after
I'd lost Marcel and Jerome.

871
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,165
Okay.

872
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,253
I'd been careless
with my birth control pills before,

873
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,964
and now I just didn't use them.

874
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,133
Didn't the
whole experience with Marcel

875
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,261
convince you that there was no
room for children in your life?

876
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,054
That's right.

877
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,019
I know it sounds
incomprehensible,

878
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,689
but actually, it was because
of my crippling fear

879
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:29,984
of becoming pregnant
that I didn't take the pills.

880
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:32,194
It's probably impossible
to understand.

881
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:35,948
No, it makes sense to me.

882
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:38,242
You were so afraid
of getting pregnant

883
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,829
that you repressed
the possibility of it.

884
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:45,249
You couldn't even handle
seeing the box of pills.

885
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,298
Okay.

886
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,597
Would you turn it down?

887
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,894
If you look at the screen
you can see your child,

888
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,812
but I can't tell you
the gender yet.

889
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,565
I don't give a shit
about the gender.

890
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:11,150
I want it removed.

891
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:17,615
Okay. Uh, you're in week eleven.

892
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:22,328
So legally, there are
no barriers for an abortion.

893
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,372
Yes, I know that.
Just remove it.

894
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,877
Well, we have some procedures
to follow.

895
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,670
There's nothing more
to talk about.

896
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,881
I can have it removed.
I want it removed.

897
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:37,092
It is a very big decision,
best not made in haste.

898
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,970
Didn't you understand
what I just said?

899
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,514
Okay, there's
an informative consultation

900
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,060
with our psychologist before
you can have the procedure.

901
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:57,446
You didn't really fill out the form.

902
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,531
Maybe you didn't have time,

903
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:04,745
uh, so I will need
to ask a few more questions.

904
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:08,457
What's the most important thing
in your life right now?

905
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:12,711
It could be many things,
your family, your friends, your...

906
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,005
The most important thing
for me right now

907
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,299
is to get an abortion.

908
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:22,137
Yes. Well, that's what
we're going to resolve together.

909
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,976
I need some information.

910
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,438
Do you love the father?

911
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,900
That's none of your business.

912
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:40,322
Well, it is my business
because I'm here to form

913
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,242
an impression
of your circumstances.

914
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,202
That's my job.

915
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,162
Okay, so what would you
most like me

916
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,833
to answer about the father in order
to get the fucking abortion?

917
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:53,752
That I love him,
or that I don't love him?

918
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,465
Or that I... I don't know him
because I fuck tons of men?

919
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,724
I, uh, see that
you were emotional

920
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,101
during the doctor's examination.

921
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,395
I think you're emotional.

922
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:15,607
Please, listen. This is what we call
an informative consultation.

923
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,818
What is it I need
to be informed of?

924
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,029
That you can't
stuff the kid back inside?

925
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,698
I already know that.

926
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,076
I just need to be certain

927
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:28,454
that you're completely sure
about your choice,

928
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:31,790
and my professional opinion
based on your behavior

929
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,208
is that clearly you're not.

930
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,544
I've never been more sure
in my life.

931
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:38,297
I want that fetus out right now.

932
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,717
And as a professional, I cannot
defend recommending an abortion

933
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:42,968
based on this conversation.

934
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:47,139
I've already had a kid!
I know what I want!

935
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:48,682
Fuck you.

936
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,275
There were,
of course, many ways to do it.

937
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:01,070
But I had chosen to follow
the common medical procedure

938
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:04,031
I had learnt
while studying medicine,

939
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,325
as it was of great importance
for me

940
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,828
to get the fetus out straight away
rather than wait for it

941
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:12,915
to be expelled
a couple of days later.

942
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:39,001
Clearly, the most painful part

943
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:42,045
would be the gradual opening
of the cervix,

944
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:46,508
which otherwise was always done
under anesthesia.

945
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:14,072
Say something, Pierrot.

946
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:17,117
What do you mean?

947
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:20,078
Well, you always have
so many clever things to say.

948
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:29,338
Well, I... I feel bad for you

949
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,381
that you had to cause yourself
so much pain.

950
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:42,225
But the... the abortion
is completely understandable.

951
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,518
You simply thought the child

952
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:46,146
wouldn't have
a life worth living, so...

953
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:48,774
Yeah, but the abortion in itself.

954
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,735
- Abortion is not murder.
- Oh, come on.

955
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:55,822
Don't fall back on false clichés
just for my sake.

956
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,700
I ask again,
what about the abortion?

957
01:39:58,868 --> 01:39:59,993
I have no comment.

958
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:03,163
I'm a big proponent
for abortion rights,

959
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,916
but this is 100% female territory.

960
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:08,335
I don't believe a man
can ever comprehend

961
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:11,088
the situation or the pain.

962
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:15,217
And when it comes to the method,
I think the less said, the better.

963
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:18,345
Those are two
very interesting points of view.

964
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:21,348
First, you say that as a man,

965
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,642
you can't understand
a woman's feelings

966
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,311
with regard to abortion.

967
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,398
Well, that's a bit like saying
that I couldn't understand

968
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:32,317
the victims of earthquakes
because they were Chinese.

969
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,655
I thought we agreed that empathy

970
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:39,574
was the foundation
of all humanism.

971
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:42,661
But I can see that it's very
convenient for men

972
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:45,914
to leave all that abortion
stuff to women.

973
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:47,708
That way they don't have
to deal with the guilt

974
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,836
and all of the small stuff.

975
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:53,588
But your other remark
provokes me even more.

976
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:57,092
You think my method
is not worth discussing?

977
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,764
What enjoyment would I,
or let alone a young pregnant girl,

978
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:04,725
have from hearing
all the lurid details

979
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:08,979
about how a fetus is removed
in a clinic or any other way?

980
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:12,816
Well, then,
we're back at the discussion

981
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:15,527
about eating something
that was once alive.

982
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:19,573
Do you really think
abortion is so repugnant

983
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,324
if you believe
that we should know

984
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:24,995
how animals are slaughtered
in order to eat them?

985
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:27,164
Well, that's a fact
we have to live with,

986
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,458
even if we try to repress it.

987
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:31,042
Just as we do with abortion.

988
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:34,045
Well, you sound
like a pro-lifer from Texas.

989
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:37,382
I don't think so.

990
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,927
First of all, I'm just
as much a pro-choice as you are.

991
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:42,471
But on principle,

992
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:46,558
I believe that taboos
are damaging for human beings.

993
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:50,395
That's a relatively easy stance
for you to take.

994
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,443
One that can be misconstrued
as a...

995
01:41:56,611 --> 01:41:59,446
as an argument
against pregnancy termination.

996
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:03,283
I don't want
to belittle anything,

997
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:06,870
but I can't see your abortion
as anything but a...

998
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,748
luxury problem.

999
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:15,337
A luxury problem?

1000
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:18,715
The really serious,
serious abortions,

1001
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:23,970
the ones that save lives,
far from our social spheres,

1002
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,806
you can't endanger them
just because you

1003
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,642
provocatively insist
on showing the gory details.

1004
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:33,480
Consider all the millions
of repressed women,

1005
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:38,193
the victims of rape
and incest, hunger.

1006
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,363
All those who,
maybe thanks to an abortion,

1007
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:42,572
have regained a new life,

1008
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:46,576
maybe saved a child
from starving to death.

1009
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:51,748
You can't harm them just because
of some principle of openness.

1010
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:59,673
Luckily, I was able to get the head
of the fetus out on the first try,

1011
01:42:59,841 --> 01:43:01,633
but it rarely goes like that.

1012
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:05,262
In the 12th week,
the diameter of the head

1013
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,431
is a little more than
1.2 centimeters.

1014
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:11,184
Therefore,
a very impressive instrument

1015
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,228
has been developed
by the medical community.

1016
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:16,106
The nutcracker is an instrument

1017
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:20,068
that we use to get the fetus
out of the uterus completely.

1018
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:24,447
We enter it into and through
the dilated cervical channel

1019
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:27,033
and position it around the head
of the fetus,

1020
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,287
and you crack it like a nut,

1021
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:33,164
and then you pull out the fetus,
and there you have it.

1022
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,917
That is the so-called nutcracker.

1023
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:38,503
This is not something I need to know.

1024
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,965
Oh, I hope you're not going

1025
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:46,011
to be an opponent of abortion
based on that.

1026
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:49,639
No, but you have to think
of the outrage

1027
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:52,726
this knowledge would create
in society.

1028
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:56,646
So, you're saying that people
in general are too stupid

1029
01:43:56,814 --> 01:44:00,984
to make decisions
on an informed basis.

1030
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:05,363
And that coming from a man
who only an hour ago sermonized

1031
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:07,908
about his belief
in human qualities.

1032
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,952
No, you... you're simplifying things.

1033
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,080
You can't look at it like that.

1034
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,666
It's funny to see you
so emotional suddenly.

1035
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,090
Looking back,
it rankles me a bit

1036
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:28,428
that I didn't just
show up all calm and collected

1037
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,973
at the appointment
with the psychologist

1038
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:34,726
and have my abortion
under full anesthesia.

1039
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:38,355
The fact is that when
you're completely under,

1040
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:41,191
the fetus doesn't feel
anything either,

1041
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:45,403
whereas my action, of course,
caused pain,

1042
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:47,447
depending on how much consciousness

1043
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:52,369
you want to ascribe
to a fetus about 12 weeks old.

1044
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,080
I'm a bit nervous
about bringing that subject up,

1045
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:57,540
as most of the abortions
in the world,

1046
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,668
due to lack of resources,

1047
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:03,964
occur just under
local anesthesia or none.

1048
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,802
Well, you're a careful man.

1049
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:13,974
Whether we talk about abortion
or not, you can't escape death,

1050
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:18,061
and my fetus could have turned
out to be a fine human being,

1051
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,856
but one that would
also eventually die.

1052
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,904
What haunts me
is the ironic detail

1053
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:30,865
that my father and I
were snail-gatherers.

1054
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:38,289
We had the deepest compassion,
not to say sentimentality,

1055
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:41,543
about the smallest living things
on the planet

1056
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:44,004
which we demonstrated
by saving snails,

1057
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:47,674
often, by the way,
the same size as my fetus,

1058
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,552
from certain death on the path.

1059
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,180
We did that only
when the other one wasn't watching,

1060
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:56,516
as it was a bit embarrassing.

1061
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,353
Are you picking up snails?

1062
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:03,314
No.

1063
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:06,693
Are you sure you weren't
picking up snails?

1064
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,486
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

1065
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,739
Yeah.

1066
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:16,995
- Shall we drop the subject?
- Yes, please.

1067
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:19,247
Are you sure
you don't want a little tour

1068
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:21,291
of the technical details

1069
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:24,127
of removal of organs
for organ donations?

1070
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:26,713
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1071
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:30,383
Where were we?

1072
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:35,388
I think something about your boss
sending you to see a psychologist.

1073
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:37,390
Yes, that's right.

1074
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,356
- My name is Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

1075
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:49,527
- And I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Sex addict.

1076
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:52,280
My name is Joe,
and I'm a nymphomaniac.

1077
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:55,825
We say sex addict.
Here, everyone's the same.

1078
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:04,876
Renée, last time you
told us you had a plan.

1079
01:47:05,044 --> 01:47:06,920
How did it go?

1080
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:11,216
I thought of trying something new,
as nothing had helped.

1081
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:16,304
I thought if I overdosed...

1082
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:18,681
in other words,
if I did the exact opposite

1083
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,184
of what we are trying
to do here,

1084
01:47:21,352 --> 01:47:22,769
then I could get well.

1085
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:25,396
You mean function normally.

1086
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,817
I had prepared
the whole thing very carefully.

1087
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:32,028
Sent my husband away
for the weekend

1088
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:36,032
and had the children
taken care of.

1089
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,201
It was to happen on the Saturday.

1090
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:45,625
I had... I had collected
phone numbers for a whole month,

1091
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:48,795
and then back in the coal.

1092
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:31,045
They fucked me for three hours.

1093
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,340
And how did
you feel about that?

1094
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,427
Well, I never feel good afterwards.
I feel ashamed.

1095
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:40,930
But in relation to...
to your addiction,

1096
01:48:41,098 --> 01:48:43,892
do you feel relieved
like you thought you would?

1097
01:48:46,604 --> 01:48:47,770
No.

1098
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:53,151
What should I do?
I'm ready to do what's necessary.

1099
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:56,154
Sex addiction
is very different from,

1100
01:48:56,322 --> 01:48:58,948
say, abuse of drugs or alcohol

1101
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,701
because you don't actually need
either of those things.

1102
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,995
These addictions can
be completely removed

1103
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:08,625
by removing the drug or the alcohol,
not that that's easy.

1104
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:11,336
But the difference
with sex addiction

1105
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:14,589
is that everyone has a sexuality

1106
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:17,342
that's an integral part
of their personality.

1107
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:24,390
If one could
imagine exterminating sexuality,

1108
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:26,643
then you'd be left
with a severely reduced person

1109
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:31,272
because... because sexuality
also includes tenderness,

1110
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,943
contact, solidarity with others,

1111
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:38,238
which would be hard to imagine
anyone living without on some level.

1112
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:43,534
What you're saying is that no one
can remove their sexuality,

1113
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:45,995
even though it's destroying
everything for them.

1114
01:49:46,163 --> 01:49:48,039
I wouldn't say no one,

1115
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:50,875
but let's say, at most,
one in a million

1116
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:53,836
manage to live a life
without sexuality.

1117
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:57,674
But you can't be basing your therapy
on that one in a million.

1118
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:01,261
No. The first
and most important step

1119
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:05,181
is to remove incentive
and to reduce exposure.

1120
01:50:06,809 --> 01:50:08,601
You have to ask yourself

1121
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:11,813
what kind of incentives you have
and then make it difficult

1122
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:13,731
for yourself to come
into contact with them.

1123
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:17,777
Basically, anything that
makes you think about sex.

1124
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:21,489
#  #

1125
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:28,533
Stop it.

1126
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:35,748
Joe has something
she'd like to share.

1127
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,419
- My name is Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

1128
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:41,379
And I'm a sex addict,

1129
01:52:41,547 --> 01:52:45,842
but I haven't had sex
for three weeks and five days.

1130
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:50,138
Tell us how you did it, Joe.

1131
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:53,433
- You brought notes?
- Yes.

1132
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:03,818
Dear everyone,
don't think it's been easy,

1133
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:07,488
but I understand now
that we are all alike.

1134
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:26,924
- Are you okay, Joe?
- Yes, yes.

1135
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,306
Would you like
a glass of water?

1136
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,602
Thank you.

1137
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:48,488
Would you rather share another time?

1138
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:56,662
No, I'd like to speak.

1139
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:06,964
Dear everyone,
don't think it's been easy,

1140
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:09,342
but I understand now

1141
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:13,513
that we're not
and never will be alike.

1142
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:20,478
I'm not like you,
who fucks to be validated

1143
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:23,189
and might just as well give up
putting cocks inside you.

1144
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:27,026
You already got your bloody kick
a long time ago

1145
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:29,779
when it turned out that someone
was even bothered to fuck you.

1146
01:54:29,947 --> 01:54:31,822
And I'm not like you.

1147
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,866
Eat yourself to death
if you want.

1148
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,118
I have no pity for you.

1149
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:37,995
All you want is to be filled up,

1150
01:54:38,163 --> 01:54:43,167
and whether it's by a man
or by tons of disgusting slop

1151
01:54:43,335 --> 01:54:45,253
makes no difference,

1152
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,630
because it's all just
a pathetic attempt

1153
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:50,716
at filling out
your own resounding emptiness

1154
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:55,721
and hiding your ridiculous
egocentric self-loathing.

1155
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:58,391
And I'm definitely not like you.

1156
01:54:58,559 --> 01:55:02,728
That empathy you claim is a lie

1157
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:06,941
because all you are
is society's morality police,

1158
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:12,238
whose duty is to erase my obscenity
from the surface of the Earth,

1159
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:15,241
so that the bourgeoisie
won't feel sick.

1160
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:20,121
I'm not like you.

1161
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:26,085
I am a nymphomaniac,
and I love myself for being one,

1162
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:30,631
but above all, I love my cunt

1163
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:33,926
and my filthy, dirty lust.

1164
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:42,852
"Burning Down the House") #

1165
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:59,410
What just happened?

1166
01:55:59,578 --> 01:56:03,623
I didn't get that,
with the car that burned.

1167
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:05,374
No, I'm sorry.

1168
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:09,170
I was just in too much of
a hurry to get to the last chapter.

1169
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:21,223
It's dawning.

1170
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:24,018
How can you tell?

1171
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:26,937
Oh, it's...
it's just a slight coloring.

1172
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:30,524
I know because I've stood here
so often at this time.

1173
01:56:31,902 --> 01:56:34,236
You could say
I've developed an ability

1174
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:38,199
to see dawn before everyone else.

1175
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:44,705
Then you understand
what I mean when I say

1176
01:56:44,873 --> 01:56:49,126
that twilight suddenly appeared
at this point in my story.

1177
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:54,507
I understood that society
had no room for me,

1178
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:59,220
and I had no room for society
and never had.

1179
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:03,265
It would've been much, much easier

1180
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:05,685
to have realized that earlier on,

1181
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:09,021
but suddenly,

1182
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:11,941
my senses unfolded dramatically.

1183
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:17,780
To go from the respectable
daylight side of society

1184
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:20,324
to the shady, nocturnal side

1185
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,411
was like changing sides in a war.

1186
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:26,956
You put your old army behind you,

1187
01:57:27,124 --> 01:57:30,501
and suddenly, the next second,
you're swallowed by the new one.

1188
01:57:30,669 --> 01:57:33,045
There's no in between.

1189
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,145
I'm sure it was quite natural for you

1190
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:51,647
to furnish your room
as a monk's cell,

1191
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:56,318
but as an inspiration
for this story, chapter headings

1192
01:57:56,486 --> 01:57:58,612
hasn't been easy.

1193
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:01,866
There's simply nothing
left for me to use.

1194
01:58:03,452 --> 01:58:05,453
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1195
01:58:06,788 --> 01:58:09,331
But if I may,
I can give you a tip.

1196
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:12,585
Yes, please.

1197
01:58:12,753 --> 01:58:15,463
You know, I occupy myself
mostly with texts,

1198
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:18,966
but sometimes the text can seem so...

1199
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:23,012
so empty, so unfathomably empty.

1200
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:27,141
It could be the best text
by the most famous author.

1201
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:30,936
The solution might be
to change your point of view.

1202
01:58:32,647 --> 01:58:34,607
I don't get that.

1203
01:58:34,775 --> 01:58:39,945
Things hide
when they become familiar.

1204
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:44,116
But if you look at them
from another angle,

1205
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:47,077
they might take
on a new meaning.

1206
01:58:58,215 --> 01:58:59,507
You're right.

1207
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:05,262
Before this was just the stain
from the tea I threw.

1208
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:09,391
Can you see what it could be?

1209
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:12,186
A revolver!

1210
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:15,898
No, a revolver has a drum
that revolves.

1211
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:18,067
It's a pistol.

1212
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:20,945
Can you see what kind it could be?

1213
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,240
No, I don't remember anything
like that from my literature.

1214
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:26,826
Oh, but it's something
I can remember from mine.

1215
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:31,288
- Ian Fleming.
- Not familiar.

1216
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:34,708
If you haven't read that,
you haven't read anything at all.

1217
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:39,088
This could be,
with a little imagination,

1218
01:59:39,256 --> 01:59:42,883
a Walther PPK automatic,

1219
01:59:43,051 --> 01:59:45,302
the same gun
that was issued to Bond,

1220
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:48,889
after his preferred pistol,
the Beretta, had jammed.

1221
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:52,101
Is that something you can use?

1222
01:59:54,062 --> 01:59:55,980
Oh, yes, it is.

1223
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:59,316
#  #

1224
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:10,119
Whether I left
society or it left me, I cannot say.

1225
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:13,414
I suppose you could make
an argument for both sides.

1226
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:16,876
I was on my way
to the shady side

1227
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:20,421
of the debt collecting business,
which, among other things,

1228
02:00:20,589 --> 02:00:23,716
involves stuff like
burning people's cars.

1229
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:29,680
I had for a long time
known about this man, L.

1230
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:37,187
Hi, my name is Joe.

1231
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:41,275
I know that. Come in.

1232
02:00:45,906 --> 02:00:47,865
I'm looking for a job.

1233
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:50,826
I've been working in an office,

1234
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,495
and I was never really good at it.

1235
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:57,291
I can understand that.
I mean, what's the point?

1236
02:00:59,961 --> 02:01:03,756
I've thought of you now and then
and wondered when you'd show up.

1237
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:11,430
My lifestyle is relatively expensive,

1238
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,727
and I need a fair amount
of free time for a sideline.

1239
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:18,812
Of course.
I already know that.

1240
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,857
I believe I possess
some qualifications

1241
02:01:22,025 --> 02:01:24,276
and that I'm rather unscrupulous.

1242
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:28,030
I know all about your qualifications
and they're excellent.

1243
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:31,825
And you have already proven you
are unscrupulous by coming here.

1244
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:38,874
I would suggest that you start
your own little business

1245
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:40,918
with my help.

1246
02:01:41,086 --> 02:01:45,089
I understand you possess
a great deal of insight

1247
02:01:45,256 --> 02:01:48,133
about a rather broad spectrum of men.

1248
02:01:49,469 --> 02:01:53,555
This could be, or should be,
capitalized on.

1249
02:01:53,723 --> 02:01:56,225
What should I do?

1250
02:01:56,393 --> 02:01:59,353
I facilitate certain assignments
for my humble firm

1251
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:01,605
as part of a debt
collection business.

1252
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:04,274
In other words,
I need subcontractors

1253
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:07,152
who can put moderate pressure
on individuals,

1254
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,240
with whom my clients rightly
or wrongly have a bone to pick.

1255
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:13,867
- Understand?
- Extortion.

1256
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:15,828
No. No, no, no, no.

1257
02:02:15,996 --> 02:02:20,749
I always prefer
the term "debt collection."

1258
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,128
- Yeah.
- I refrain from judging

1259
02:02:24,295 --> 02:02:28,549
whether my clients' wishes
are legitimate or otherwise,

1260
02:02:28,717 --> 02:02:33,012
a point of view I strongly
recommend you follow.

1261
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:39,852
I'm still unsure of what it is
I should do.

1262
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:42,104
Well, you'll need two thugs,

1263
02:02:42,272 --> 02:02:44,815
and I can think of two good ones.

1264
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:49,528
They both have a lot of experience
and can show you the ropes.

1265
02:02:50,655 --> 02:02:52,531
That's interesting.

1266
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:55,701
It's not at all interesting.

1267
02:02:55,869 --> 02:02:58,120
Most interesting thing about it was

1268
02:02:58,288 --> 02:03:01,165
how easily I dedicated
myself to crime.

1269
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:03,542
My main
qualification, of course,

1270
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:06,795
was my considerable experience
with men and sex.

1271
02:03:06,963 --> 02:03:11,008
But even my more specialized
skills came in handy.

1272
02:03:32,697 --> 02:03:36,575
No, now this is not how it goes.

1273
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:39,078
You have to wait until you're hit.

1274
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:45,501
The two helpers that
L had recommended were okay,

1275
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:49,171
but they were predisposed
to a rather repetitive technique,

1276
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:53,133
which consisted of creating
as much havoc as possible

1277
02:03:53,301 --> 02:03:54,718
with a pair of iron bars.

1278
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:14,738
Destroying your things doesn't
seem to have much effect on you.

1279
02:04:14,906 --> 02:04:16,365
The only thing
worth mentioning

1280
02:04:16,533 --> 02:04:18,742
from my first years
as a collector

1281
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:22,663
was the story of an unusually
sober-minded,

1282
02:04:22,831 --> 02:04:25,624
and for that reason vulnerable, man.

1283
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:28,669
The dirt I threatened
to go public with

1284
02:04:28,837 --> 02:04:32,339
was normally within
my core competence: sex.

1285
02:04:33,258 --> 02:04:37,845
But for once, here was a man
I was unable to read sexually,

1286
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:40,639
so I became persistent.

1287
02:04:40,807 --> 02:04:42,641
Tie him to the chair.

1288
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,978
Don't hurt him.

1289
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:51,567
I can't find a stain on you,

1290
02:04:52,443 --> 02:04:55,404
but my experience tells me
that no man is spotless.

1291
02:04:56,614 --> 02:05:00,617
Luckily, you're equipped with
a very reliable truth detector.

1292
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:14,089
I'm going to tell you a few stories.

1293
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:16,633
All you have to do is listen.

1294
02:05:18,678 --> 02:05:21,805
You're in a bar watching a couple...

1295
02:05:21,973 --> 02:05:24,516
I now meticulously
went through the catalogue

1296
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:27,895
of sexual deviations
in fictional form.

1297
02:05:28,062 --> 02:05:30,981
Stories about sado-masochism,

1298
02:05:31,149 --> 02:05:35,277
fetishism, homosexuality,
you name it.

1299
02:05:35,445 --> 02:05:37,154
But he didn't react.

1300
02:05:37,322 --> 02:05:39,781
And I'd almost given up
when I said...

1301
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:44,578
On your way home,
you walk through the park.

1302
02:05:49,334 --> 02:05:51,043
And something makes you stop.

1303
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,004
You hear something.

1304
02:06:08,228 --> 02:06:09,937
Yes, that's it.

1305
02:06:10,104 --> 02:06:13,815
You can hear the children
in the playground.

1306
02:06:14,943 --> 02:06:19,404
You sit on a bench nearby
and watch them play.

1307
02:06:19,572 --> 02:06:22,741
There's a little boy in shorts.

1308
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:26,328
He's playing in the sandpit.

1309
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:33,210
He looks at you
with his blue eyes.

1310
02:06:34,754 --> 02:06:36,463
He smiles at you.

1311
02:06:36,631 --> 02:06:38,840
I think he comes to you.

1312
02:06:39,008 --> 02:06:44,137
He sits on your lap
and looks up at your face.

1313
02:06:44,806 --> 02:06:49,059
He says he'd like
to come home with you.

1314
02:06:53,231 --> 02:06:54,481
At home,

1315
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:57,943
you can't fight the idea
of being naked together.

1316
02:06:58,945 --> 02:07:01,405
He crawls all over you.

1317
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:03,198
You get an erection.

1318
02:07:03,366 --> 02:07:05,450
Won't you please stop?

1319
02:07:05,618 --> 02:07:08,370
He lies on his stomach.

1320
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:11,999
You pull down his pants.

1321
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:13,792
I'll pay!

1322
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,452
You did what?

1323
02:07:48,619 --> 02:07:50,370
I gave him a blowjob.

1324
02:07:50,538 --> 02:07:54,207
- Why? That pig!
- I took pity on him.

1325
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:55,709
Pity?

1326
02:07:55,877 --> 02:07:59,379
Yes. I had just destroyed his life.

1327
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:03,717
Nobody knew his secret,
most probably not even himself.

1328
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:07,512
He sat there with the shame.

1329
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,932
I suppose I sucked him off
as a kind of apology.

1330
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:12,142
That's unbelievable.

1331
02:08:13,436 --> 02:08:16,313
No, listen to me.
This is a man who'd succeeded

1332
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:18,440
in repressing his own desire,

1333
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:23,737
who had never before given into it,
right up until I forced it out.

1334
02:08:23,905 --> 02:08:26,406
He had lived a life full of denial

1335
02:08:26,574 --> 02:08:28,992
and had never hurt a soul.

1336
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,995
I think that's laudable.

1337
02:08:32,163 --> 02:08:33,205
No matter how much I try,

1338
02:08:33,373 --> 02:08:35,957
I can't find anything laudable
in pedophilia.

1339
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:39,002
That's because you think
about the perhaps five percent

1340
02:08:39,170 --> 02:08:41,588
who actually hurt children.

1341
02:08:41,756 --> 02:08:46,510
The remaining 95 percent
never live out their fantasies.

1342
02:08:46,677 --> 02:08:49,096
Think about their suffering.

1343
02:08:49,263 --> 02:08:54,184
Sexuality is the strongest force
in human beings.

1344
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:59,189
To be born with a forbidden
sexuality must be agonizing.

1345
02:08:59,357 --> 02:09:02,776
The pedophile
who manages to get through life

1346
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:05,028
with the shame of his desire

1347
02:09:05,196 --> 02:09:08,990
while never acting on it,
deserves a bloody medal.

1348
02:09:16,082 --> 02:09:19,709
The writer Thomas Mann
said somewhere

1349
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:21,962
that a temptation resisted

1350
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:26,425
is not a sin
but a test of virtue.

1351
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:33,807
Wasn't there something
about that writer and boys?

1352
02:09:33,975 --> 02:09:36,560
Yeah, so they say.

1353
02:09:36,727 --> 02:09:39,896
I suppose he dealt with it
by writing them out.

1354
02:09:40,064 --> 02:09:42,816
And he got a medal, a Nobel Prize.

1355
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:50,449
But there was
another reason for my sympathy,

1356
02:09:50,616 --> 02:09:52,951
which you find so mysterious.

1357
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:58,832
I saw a man who was carrying
the same cross as myself.

1358
02:10:01,461 --> 02:10:03,545
Loneliness.

1359
02:10:06,799 --> 02:10:09,551
We were both sexual outcasts.

1360
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:20,061
In any case,
some years passed,

1361
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:23,190
during which my business grew,

1362
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:27,944
enabling me to step up my
anonymous deposits to Marcel.

1363
02:10:28,863 --> 02:10:32,407
Your business is doing great.

1364
02:10:32,575 --> 02:10:36,369
You complete all the jobs
I give you to perfection.

1365
02:10:36,537 --> 02:10:41,208
And I hear only words of praise
from your other clients, but...

1366
02:10:41,375 --> 02:10:44,294
- But what?
- We aren't getting any younger.

1367
02:10:44,462 --> 02:10:48,507
No, that's for sure.

1368
02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:50,091
I think you're getting to that age

1369
02:10:50,259 --> 02:10:52,260
where you have to start thinking
about a successor.

1370
02:10:52,428 --> 02:10:56,139
Oh, I don't need a fucking successor.

1371
02:10:56,307 --> 02:10:57,974
Listen.

1372
02:10:58,142 --> 02:11:01,520
A person should take
their crime seriously.

1373
02:11:01,687 --> 02:11:04,814
You need someone
to be your right hand,

1374
02:11:04,982 --> 02:11:08,818
someone to help you.
A crown princess.

1375
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:14,366
The normal process is to find out

1376
02:11:14,534 --> 02:11:17,994
what colleagues are in prison,
or are drug addicts,

1377
02:11:18,162 --> 02:11:22,832
and thereby unable to fulfill
their roles as parents.

1378
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,337
Then, you find out
where their kids play football,

1379
02:11:27,505 --> 02:11:29,839
and you get involved.

1380
02:11:30,007 --> 02:11:31,716
You cheer them on
for a couple of years,

1381
02:11:31,884 --> 02:11:35,345
no matter how bad they are.
Actually, the worse, the better.

1382
02:11:35,513 --> 02:11:39,474
That way, gradually, you take on
the role of the parent

1383
02:11:39,642 --> 02:11:43,395
until, in the end,
you have a loyal helper

1384
02:11:43,563 --> 02:11:46,856
that will walk through fire for you.

1385
02:11:47,024 --> 02:11:49,067
Even do time for you.

1386
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:56,950
It sounds like a kind of
an entrapment you're suggesting.

1387
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:00,579
- An unsavory entrapment.
- Call it what you want,

1388
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:04,708
but if you believe at all in
the effects of good parenting,

1389
02:12:04,875 --> 02:12:07,794
that kid will have much greater
opportunities with you

1390
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:10,380
as a mentor than without.

1391
02:12:10,548 --> 02:12:12,924
And since I like you,

1392
02:12:13,092 --> 02:12:16,928
I've been looking around
for a suitable subject.

1393
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:22,392
She's 15 years old from
a family of hardened criminals,

1394
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,894
and she's been through a lot.

1395
02:12:25,062 --> 02:12:28,148
Last couple of years
she's been institutionalized.

1396
02:12:28,316 --> 02:12:30,859
Her father's in prison
and her mother died of an overdose.

1397
02:12:31,027 --> 02:12:32,736
She's a smart girl.

1398
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:34,821
And although
she doesn't play football,

1399
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:37,782
she does play basketball very badly.

1400
02:12:39,035 --> 02:12:44,414
She's chosen a team sport
because she's lonely.

1401
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:47,584
I saved the best part for last.

1402
02:12:47,752 --> 02:12:50,712
Her right ear is slightly deformed,

1403
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,591
which she is very ashamed of,

1404
02:12:54,759 --> 02:12:57,761
and of course, this serves
to isolate her even more.

1405
02:12:57,928 --> 02:13:02,265
It makes her an easy target
for even the slightest bit

1406
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:07,187
of attention
or sign of empathy from you.

1407
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:14,736
Despite my protests,
the clever L somehow talked me

1408
02:13:14,904 --> 02:13:16,529
into actually having a look at P.

1409
02:13:19,325 --> 02:13:22,702
The longer I watched the poor girl
with the deformed ear,

1410
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:26,081
the more repulsive
I found the whole plan.

1411
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,026
But as if L had foreseen this,

1412
02:13:55,194 --> 02:14:00,865
the meeting with P filled me
with pity and emotion.

1413
02:14:01,033 --> 02:14:02,742
And without wanting to,

1414
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:06,162
I found myself,
weekend after weekend,

1415
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:10,041
at her games
supporting the poor player.

1416
02:14:25,099 --> 02:14:28,643
- Thanks for cheering me on.
- You're welcome.

1417
02:14:28,811 --> 02:14:31,062
You played really well today.

1418
02:14:33,482 --> 02:14:36,151
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

1419
02:14:36,318 --> 02:14:39,362
You really improved yourself lately.

1420
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:54,627
Sixteen years. Congratulations.

1421
02:14:54,795 --> 02:14:57,589
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1422
02:15:20,362 --> 02:15:21,905
I was proud to introduce P

1423
02:15:22,072 --> 02:15:24,741
to my father's passion
and his world.

1424
02:15:27,828 --> 02:15:29,621
It's actually...

1425
02:15:31,081 --> 02:15:35,043
the souls of the trees
that we see in the winter.

1426
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:44,093
I think they look like human souls.

1427
02:15:48,182 --> 02:15:50,058
Yeah, you're right.

1428
02:15:50,935 --> 02:15:53,686
They do look like human souls.

1429
02:15:53,896 --> 02:15:57,106
Twisted souls, regular souls,

1430
02:15:57,274 --> 02:15:59,359
crazy souls,

1431
02:15:59,527 --> 02:16:03,196
all depending on the kind
of lives human beings lead.

1432
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:10,495
Then that must be
Miss Williamson from number 21.

1433
02:16:10,663 --> 02:16:13,164
That's not a very nice thing
to say about Miss Williamson.

1434
02:16:13,332 --> 02:16:16,876
But she's always angry.
She has a monster in her belly.

1435
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:19,587
Well, she does have
an ulcer in her belly

1436
02:16:19,755 --> 02:16:21,464
that I've been treating
for the last 15 years.

1437
02:16:24,009 --> 02:16:26,427
And sure enough,
one of the following days

1438
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:28,847
my dad dragged me
into the woods again.

1439
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:32,809
I found my tree.
My soul tree.

1440
02:16:35,145 --> 02:16:40,900
And no, it's not that one, okay,
'cause then I would be dead.

1441
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:45,029
This is my tree.

1442
02:16:48,409 --> 02:16:52,537
- It's not an ash tree.
- No, it's an oak tree.

1443
02:16:55,749 --> 02:16:57,625
It has two trunks.

1444
02:16:57,793 --> 02:17:01,004
Yeah, isn't it great?

1445
02:17:01,171 --> 02:17:06,384
It shows itself to both sides,
the lake and the forest.

1446
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:20,690
But, Dad, how does
a tree get two trunks?

1447
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:26,279
The most common reason
is that the top broke

1448
02:17:26,447 --> 02:17:28,323
when it was very young.

1449
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:32,327
That means
that you've been broken once.

1450
02:17:32,494 --> 02:17:34,537
Have you, Dad?

1451
02:17:40,753 --> 02:17:43,963
It seems that it can be
rather revealing...

1452
02:17:45,424 --> 02:17:47,717
to find your soul tree.

1453
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:57,352
My father found his soul tree,
but I've never found mine.

1454
02:17:57,895 --> 02:18:03,066
"You will know it when you see it,"
is what he said.

1455
02:18:09,657 --> 02:18:15,495
Kitchen and dining room.
And in here...

1456
02:18:17,331 --> 02:18:19,666
When P reached the age of maturity

1457
02:18:19,833 --> 02:18:22,126
and I became her personal adviser,

1458
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:24,796
I asked her to move in with me.

1459
02:18:33,222 --> 02:18:35,974
Let me see you with your hair up.

1460
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:38,643
You're so pretty.

1461
02:18:50,698 --> 02:18:54,409
All this time
all my sexual activity had stopped.

1462
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:59,122
My groin was one big sore
from my abuse that wouldn't heal,

1463
02:18:59,289 --> 02:19:02,125
and made even
masturbation impossible.

1464
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:09,674
I experienced definite
abstinence symptoms...

1465
02:19:09,842 --> 02:19:11,801
fever and cramps.

1466
02:19:36,785 --> 02:19:38,536
Joe, what's going on?

1467
02:19:40,748 --> 02:19:43,541
- Careful.
- We need to clear this up.

1468
02:19:52,426 --> 02:19:55,386
I just get this sometimes.

1469
02:19:58,724 --> 02:20:01,225
It's okay. It's okay.

1470
02:20:05,314 --> 02:20:07,815
Do you want to go back to bed?

1471
02:20:09,818 --> 02:20:12,028
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1472
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:30,046
I love you, Joe.

1473
02:20:30,214 --> 02:20:31,964
I love you, too.

1474
02:20:33,383 --> 02:20:35,718
I don't mean it in that way.

1475
02:20:38,764 --> 02:20:42,183
Come on, it's late.
You should go back to bed.

1476
02:20:43,727 --> 02:20:44,769
Good night.

1477
02:20:47,648 --> 02:20:50,066
Perhaps she really loved you.

1478
02:20:54,154 --> 02:20:57,532
She was so very young.

1479
02:20:57,699 --> 02:21:01,994
Maybe she, too, discovered
her cunt at the age of two.

1480
02:21:02,162 --> 02:21:04,288
Maybe earlier.

1481
02:21:04,456 --> 02:21:05,998
I couldn't accept it.

1482
02:21:06,166 --> 02:21:09,961
Perhaps because you
really wanted it to be true.

1483
02:21:12,047 --> 02:21:13,714
Perhaps I hoped it.

1484
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:17,218
It's very touching,
all this about P.

1485
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:23,015
Then you've probably
misunderstood the whole thing.

1486
02:21:23,183 --> 02:21:26,686
Shall we get the story over
and done with?

1487
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:56,883
Don't.

1488
02:21:58,093 --> 02:22:00,178
I wanna see you.

1489
02:22:00,345 --> 02:22:01,345
- Don't.
- Why?

1490
02:22:01,513 --> 02:22:02,972
- Please, don't.
- Why not?

1491
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:06,684
No. No, I have a wound.

1492
02:22:06,852 --> 02:22:08,853
- I have a wound.
- It doesn't matter.

1493
02:22:09,021 --> 02:22:12,899
- No, you don't understand.
- I have that thing with my ear.

1494
02:22:13,066 --> 02:22:15,735
I'm so ashamed.

1495
02:22:52,105 --> 02:22:54,190
Do you like me?

1496
02:22:57,778 --> 02:22:59,779
You're so beautiful.

1497
02:24:37,461 --> 02:24:40,212
There's one thing
I don't understand.

1498
02:24:41,048 --> 02:24:43,758
Did she know what you did
for a living?

1499
02:24:43,925 --> 02:24:49,096
P was very discreet
and a girl of few words.

1500
02:24:50,599 --> 02:24:52,892
Oddly, although I worked
strange hours,

1501
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:54,935
she never asked about my work.

1502
02:24:56,688 --> 02:24:59,523
But one day she had a question.

1503
02:25:01,151 --> 02:25:02,777
Joe.

1504
02:25:07,824 --> 02:25:11,660
Why did you start
coming to my basketball matches?

1505
02:25:13,747 --> 02:25:16,415
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

1506
02:25:22,005 --> 02:25:24,965
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

1507
02:25:28,762 --> 02:25:31,430
I didn't tell you because I...

1508
02:25:31,598 --> 02:25:34,600
I thought you'd be upset...

1509
02:25:35,977 --> 02:25:38,854
and that you'd get angry at me.

1510
02:25:39,022 --> 02:25:41,524
I won't get angry.

1511
02:25:46,071 --> 02:25:48,197
What I do...

1512
02:25:49,741 --> 02:25:52,410
My job isn't a normal job.

1513
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,703
It's not legal.

1514
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:57,748
No one in my family
does anything legal.

1515
02:26:03,422 --> 02:26:07,842
A man that's helped me in my business
suggested that I watched you.

1516
02:26:10,762 --> 02:26:15,057
The plan was that I...
I should look at you

1517
02:26:15,225 --> 02:26:19,520
to see whether one day I could
use you in my work.

1518
02:26:19,688 --> 02:26:22,648
I should make friends with you

1519
02:26:22,816 --> 02:26:26,026
because I knew you didn't
have a mother or a father.

1520
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:28,028
What's wrong with that?

1521
02:26:28,196 --> 02:26:31,782
Don't you see
how evil that plan was?

1522
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:35,661
- I felt terrible.
- You shouldn't have.

1523
02:26:35,829 --> 02:26:37,788
Why not?

1524
02:26:40,584 --> 02:26:43,002
Because if you hadn't...

1525
02:26:44,963 --> 02:26:47,214
we'd never have met.

1526
02:26:52,012 --> 02:26:56,223
I'd like to go with you
to work next time.

1527
02:26:56,391 --> 02:26:57,808
No.

1528
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:08,402
Will you think about it?

1529
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:11,155
- No.
- Yes.

1530
02:27:11,573 --> 02:27:14,492
She didn't take no
for an answer.

1531
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:16,911
No, of course not.

1532
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:20,498
How do you keep a wave
upon the sand?

1533
02:27:22,792 --> 02:27:28,297
And in the throes of love,
I was weak and no match for her.

1534
02:27:31,384 --> 02:27:35,012
With the risk
of being too clever for myself,

1535
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:39,642
social inheritance
is an irrefutable fact.

1536
02:27:41,019 --> 02:27:45,272
If anyone knew about the laws
of the street, it must've been P.

1537
02:27:46,483 --> 02:27:50,194
You're more right than you know.

1538
02:28:10,257 --> 02:28:12,675
- Let's shoot the fucker.
- No, no!

1539
02:28:12,842 --> 02:28:15,970
Stop! Stop!

1540
02:28:19,349 --> 02:28:21,725
We don't use firearms.

1541
02:28:22,894 --> 02:28:26,689
- I'd like to have the gun.
- The others have weapons, too.

1542
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:29,692
Well, I didn't know that,

1543
02:28:29,859 --> 02:28:31,777
but in any case,
you're not to have one.

1544
02:28:32,904 --> 02:28:34,572
But guns aren't dangerous.

1545
02:28:34,739 --> 02:28:37,157
It depends on how you use them.

1546
02:28:37,325 --> 02:28:38,784
Yes, exactly.

1547
02:28:38,952 --> 02:28:40,452
I wasn't going to shoot him.

1548
02:28:41,496 --> 02:28:43,664
We wouldn't have gotten
any money out of him that way.

1549
02:28:43,832 --> 02:28:45,708
Can I have the gun?

1550
02:28:50,338 --> 02:28:52,047
Thank you.

1551
02:29:11,610 --> 02:29:13,652
You're evil.

1552
02:29:17,657 --> 02:29:21,744
And now I'm afraid
one of those coincidences

1553
02:29:21,911 --> 02:29:27,082
you have such a hard time with
occurred with a very special person.

1554
02:29:28,335 --> 02:29:31,003
It was P's job to take us
to the debtors,

1555
02:29:31,171 --> 02:29:33,255
so until I saw the name
on the door,

1556
02:29:33,423 --> 02:29:35,799
I had no idea
whose house we were at.

1557
02:29:38,178 --> 02:29:42,640
This is Acer siccharium.

1558
02:29:42,807 --> 02:29:45,225
- Saccharinum.
- Saccharinum, yeah, that.

1559
02:29:45,393 --> 02:29:46,560
I said that.

1560
02:29:55,695 --> 02:29:57,529
Are you sure
this is the right place?

1561
02:29:57,697 --> 02:29:58,447
Yeah.

1562
02:30:05,538 --> 02:30:11,210
I was thinking maybe it's time for
you to do this one on your own.

1563
02:30:12,128 --> 02:30:13,420
Yeah?

1564
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:18,342
- Thank you, Joe.
- I don't want anything destroyed,

1565
02:30:19,302 --> 02:30:21,595
and I don't want anybody hurt.

1566
02:30:21,763 --> 02:30:27,017
Okay? You just show yourself and
offer him a reasonable payment plan.

1567
02:30:27,185 --> 02:30:31,814
If you say so, of course
that's how I'll do it.

1568
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,665
Whether the feeling
when I saw Jerome again was love,

1569
02:30:49,833 --> 02:30:51,458
I couldn't say.

1570
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:57,005
But it was a feeling...

1571
02:30:57,173 --> 02:30:59,883
and far stronger than I liked.

1572
02:31:03,763 --> 02:31:06,306
#  #

1573
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:15,023
I was actually
walking home through the alley here.

1574
02:31:15,191 --> 02:31:17,484
Your two neighborhoods
are totally different,

1575
02:31:17,652 --> 02:31:21,029
but still so close together
that the shortest route

1576
02:31:21,197 --> 02:31:25,200
from Jerome's house towards
the center was through the alley.

1577
02:31:32,167 --> 02:31:34,168
Hello!

1578
02:31:34,335 --> 02:31:38,213
- How did it go?
- Brilliant.

1579
02:31:38,381 --> 02:31:41,508
Yeah, really well.

1580
02:31:41,676 --> 02:31:44,261
I made a reasonable payment plan
like you told me to.

1581
02:31:44,429 --> 02:31:49,308
- How did he look?
- Scared.

1582
02:31:49,476 --> 02:31:51,852
How old did he look?

1583
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:55,355
I don't know. Ancient?

1584
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:18,962
Jerome was to pay
off his debt in six payments.

1585
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:21,882
Every time P
went to Jerome to collect,

1586
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:26,804
I'd pace around restlessly
until she was back home again.

1587
02:32:29,098 --> 02:32:32,392
I even had to find my mother's
sad old solitaire cards

1588
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:35,604
in order to make the hours pass.

1589
02:32:43,029 --> 02:32:44,905
Each night I was less reassured

1590
02:32:45,073 --> 02:32:48,116
by her coming home
than the night before.

1591
02:32:48,284 --> 02:32:51,537
The question of whether jealousy is
the fear of sharing

1592
02:32:51,704 --> 02:32:54,998
or the fear of losing
was of little interest to me.

1593
02:32:55,166 --> 02:32:58,293
But yes, it was a fact
that this unworthy feeling

1594
02:32:58,461 --> 02:33:03,173
I had managed to suppress
for so long was creeping up on me.

1595
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,762
The evening she was
to collect the final payment,

1596
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:10,764
she didn't kiss me.

1597
02:33:10,932 --> 02:33:13,267
I took it to be forgetfulness,

1598
02:33:13,434 --> 02:33:17,354
but the hours passed,
and she didn't return.

1599
02:33:24,445 --> 02:33:29,658
Every time I saw car lights,
I thought it was P being driven home.

1600
02:34:28,259 --> 02:34:30,344
So the next morning I took a trip

1601
02:34:30,511 --> 02:34:33,680
to the round hills
just outside of town

1602
02:34:33,848 --> 02:34:37,225
that I visited with my school class
when I was 12,

1603
02:34:37,393 --> 02:34:40,854
to say a symbolic goodbye.

1604
02:34:44,484 --> 02:34:47,194
I had decided to flee.

1605
02:34:47,362 --> 02:34:51,865
I couldn't stay in this town
with her and him.

1606
02:34:52,033 --> 02:34:56,328
I had cowardly made a plan
to escape and head south.

1607
02:34:56,496 --> 02:34:57,829
Like from some ice age

1608
02:34:57,997 --> 02:35:01,166
I didn't have the guts
to turn around and face.

1609
02:35:02,335 --> 02:35:06,546
But the goodbye was sad
and strangely unfulfilling.

1610
02:35:06,714 --> 02:35:10,676
And something called me on to
seek further up the mountain.

1611
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:45,919
#  #

1612
02:36:34,302 --> 02:36:36,887
I understand dictators
who commit murder.

1613
02:36:39,849 --> 02:36:42,726
What was Hitler,
when it all boils down,

1614
02:36:42,894 --> 02:36:46,897
other than a man to whom society
gave free reins?

1615
02:36:49,442 --> 02:36:52,736
Well, that was
just what we were missing.

1616
02:36:52,904 --> 02:36:56,740
You understand racists,
you have a soft spot for pedophiles,

1617
02:36:56,908 --> 02:36:59,826
and, of course,
now at the finishing line,

1618
02:36:59,994 --> 02:37:01,745
you have to sympathize

1619
02:37:01,913 --> 02:37:04,539
with the greatest mass
murderers of history.

1620
02:37:04,707 --> 02:37:06,958
What I mean is...

1621
02:37:08,628 --> 02:37:11,171
It's said to be difficult
to take someone's life.

1622
02:37:11,339 --> 02:37:15,217
I would've said
that it's more difficult not to

1623
02:37:15,384 --> 02:37:19,179
when, as a dictator or as me,

1624
02:37:19,347 --> 02:37:21,723
you've nothing to lose.

1625
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:25,310
For a human being,

1626
02:37:25,478 --> 02:37:28,688
killing is the most
natural thing in the world.

1627
02:37:28,856 --> 02:37:31,108
We're created for it.

1628
02:37:33,569 --> 02:37:35,237
Wonderful.

1629
02:38:25,997 --> 02:38:27,539
No, get off!

1630
02:38:37,758 --> 02:38:39,926
Fireman's grip.

1631
02:42:26,153 --> 02:42:30,698
Fill all my holes, please.

1632
02:42:55,391 --> 02:42:58,143
I still don't know
why the gun didn't work.

1633
02:42:58,310 --> 02:43:02,814
I did check to make sure that there
were bullets in the magazine.

1634
02:43:02,982 --> 02:43:05,650
It simply malfunctioned.

1635
02:43:05,818 --> 02:43:08,403
Just like Bond's Beretta.

1636
02:43:08,571 --> 02:43:11,656
I think I know enough to say
that even if you had rounds

1637
02:43:11,824 --> 02:43:13,825
in the magazine
of the Walther PPK,

1638
02:43:13,993 --> 02:43:17,495
if you'd taken off the safety,

1639
02:43:17,663 --> 02:43:20,415
you cannot shoot
until you've racked the gun.

1640
02:43:21,375 --> 02:43:23,751
You pull and release

1641
02:43:23,919 --> 02:43:26,171
the sliding mechanism.

1642
02:43:26,338 --> 02:43:28,381
And P hadn't done it
because as she said,

1643
02:43:28,549 --> 02:43:31,176
she had no intention
of shooting the man.

1644
02:43:33,345 --> 02:43:36,347
I don't know about Bond,
but I assume it has to be apparent

1645
02:43:36,515 --> 02:43:38,016
from his books and his films

1646
02:43:38,184 --> 02:43:42,479
that you have
to rack an automatic pistol.

1647
02:43:43,772 --> 02:43:45,482
Of course, you're right.

1648
02:43:46,484 --> 02:43:50,153
I've seen it in films
a thousand times.

1649
02:43:55,075 --> 02:43:56,242
It's morning.

1650
02:43:58,871 --> 02:44:02,499
- The snow is gone.
- So the sun must be up?

1651
02:44:03,709 --> 02:44:05,627
Yes, there is sun.

1652
02:44:06,962 --> 02:44:08,922
How can you see it?

1653
02:44:09,965 --> 02:44:14,552
This alley's located so that you
never get direct sunlight here,

1654
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:19,224
but I can see a small reflection
on the building on the other side.

1655
02:44:25,981 --> 02:44:29,776
I've never managed to figure
out where it comes from.

1656
02:44:30,569 --> 02:44:35,490
It must be some interplay
between windows and towers

1657
02:44:35,658 --> 02:44:38,785
and high buildings.

1658
02:44:41,413 --> 02:44:46,543
It's not much, but it's the sun
you get here at my place.

1659
02:44:50,673 --> 02:44:52,423
It's beautiful.

1660
02:45:02,601 --> 02:45:03,810
In the beginning,

1661
02:45:03,978 --> 02:45:05,812
you said that your only sin

1662
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:09,148
was that you asked
more of the sunset.

1663
02:45:10,734 --> 02:45:14,696
Meaning, I suppose, that you wanted
more from life than was good for you.

1664
02:45:17,408 --> 02:45:21,119
You were a human being
demanding your right,

1665
02:45:21,287 --> 02:45:22,829
and more than that,

1666
02:45:22,997 --> 02:45:26,374
you were a woman
demanding her right.

1667
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:32,380
Does that pardon everything?

1668
02:45:33,757 --> 02:45:37,844
Do you think if two men were to
walk down a train looking for women,

1669
02:45:38,596 --> 02:45:41,764
do you think anybody would have
raised an eyebrow,

1670
02:45:41,974 --> 02:45:44,809
or if a man had led the life you had?

1671
02:45:46,478 --> 02:45:51,065
And the story about Mrs. H.
would've been extremely banal

1672
02:45:51,233 --> 02:45:52,567
if you'd been a man.

1673
02:45:53,777 --> 02:45:56,321
And your conquest
would have been a woman.

1674
02:45:57,323 --> 02:46:01,951
When a man leaves his children
because of desire,

1675
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:05,413
we accept it with a shrug,
but you as a woman,

1676
02:46:05,873 --> 02:46:08,333
you had to take on a guilt,

1677
02:46:08,667 --> 02:46:11,085
a burden of guilt
that could never be alleviated.

1678
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:18,551
Your abortion was legal,
but more than anything else,

1679
02:46:18,719 --> 02:46:22,722
it was a punishment
you inflicted upon yourself.

1680
02:46:23,849 --> 02:46:27,101
And all in all,
all the blame and guilt

1681
02:46:27,269 --> 02:46:29,812
that piled up over the years
became too much for you,

1682
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:31,981
and you reacted aggressively,

1683
02:46:32,149 --> 02:46:35,151
almost like a man, I have to say,
and you fought back.

1684
02:46:36,445 --> 02:46:37,820
You fought back
against the gender

1685
02:46:37,988 --> 02:46:42,116
that had been oppressing
and mutilating and killing you

1686
02:46:42,284 --> 02:46:46,788
and billions of women
in the name of religion or ethics,

1687
02:46:46,955 --> 02:46:50,208
or God knows what.

1688
02:46:53,253 --> 02:46:56,172
But I wanted
to kill a human being.

1689
02:46:59,593 --> 02:47:01,594
But you didn't.

1690
02:47:03,555 --> 02:47:05,973
Because of a chance event.

1691
02:47:06,141 --> 02:47:08,184
You call it a chance event,

1692
02:47:09,687 --> 02:47:12,480
I call it subconscious resistance.

1693
02:47:12,648 --> 02:47:14,899
On the surface you wanted to kill,

1694
02:47:15,734 --> 02:47:18,152
but deep down,
you celebrated human worth

1695
02:47:19,196 --> 02:47:20,905
in a veil of forgetfulness

1696
02:47:21,073 --> 02:47:25,576
draped itself over your
knowledge of how to rack a gun.

1697
02:47:27,955 --> 02:47:30,248
Although all this
sounds frighteningly close

1698
02:47:30,416 --> 02:47:33,376
to the clichés of our times...

1699
02:47:33,544 --> 02:47:38,506
and I'm predisposed to knock
holes in your arguments...

1700
02:47:40,175 --> 02:47:42,343
I'm too tired.

1701
02:47:42,511 --> 02:47:43,803
Well, that's good.

1702
02:47:47,391 --> 02:47:49,434
Why don't you lay down?

1703
02:47:51,729 --> 02:47:53,521
Yes.

1704
02:48:04,867 --> 02:48:07,535
Let me just say that
telling my story

1705
02:48:08,579 --> 02:48:11,581
as you insisted, or permitted,

1706
02:48:13,459 --> 02:48:16,085
has put me at ease.

1707
02:48:17,546 --> 02:48:23,342
At this moment,
my addiction is very clear to me.

1708
02:48:25,721 --> 02:48:27,638
And I've come to a decision.

1709
02:48:30,184 --> 02:48:36,898
Even though only one in a million,
as my dubious therapist said,

1710
02:48:38,150 --> 02:48:42,361
succeed in mentally,

1711
02:48:42,529 --> 02:48:44,739
bodily,

1712
02:48:44,907 --> 02:48:47,116
and in her heart

1713
02:48:47,284 --> 02:48:52,455
ridding herself
of her sexuality...

1714
02:48:52,623 --> 02:48:55,166
this is now my goal.

1715
02:48:55,918 --> 02:48:58,878
But is that a life worth living?

1716
02:49:01,632 --> 02:49:04,634
It's the only way I can live it.

1717
02:49:08,472 --> 02:49:12,266
I will stand up against all odds...

1718
02:49:16,897 --> 02:49:20,316
just like a deformed tree on a hill.

1719
02:49:28,408 --> 02:49:32,912
I will muster
all of my stubbornness...

1720
02:49:36,416 --> 02:49:38,584
my strength...

1721
02:49:40,754 --> 02:49:43,506
my masculine aggression.

1722
02:49:45,801 --> 02:49:49,387
But most of all I want
to say thanks

1723
02:49:49,555 --> 02:49:54,183
to my new and maybe first friend.

1724
02:49:54,351 --> 02:49:57,228
Thank you, Seligman...

1725
02:49:58,897 --> 02:50:02,275
who perhaps is happy
when all is said and done.

1726
02:50:09,366 --> 02:50:11,951
I'm happy at any rate

1727
02:50:12,119 --> 02:50:14,203
that the shot didn't go off

1728
02:50:14,371 --> 02:50:17,123
and made me a murderer.

1729
02:50:22,754 --> 02:50:25,590
If I may, I'd like to sleep now.

1730
02:50:29,636 --> 02:50:32,263
I'll make sure
you won't be disturbed.

1731
02:50:35,267 --> 02:50:38,477
And when you wake up,
maybe we could

1732
02:50:38,645 --> 02:50:41,731
discuss your future if you'd like.

1733
02:50:50,574 --> 02:50:53,993
In your new life,

1734
02:50:54,161 --> 02:50:56,871
would you consider
seeking out your son?

1735
02:50:59,708 --> 02:51:01,709
It's possible.

1736
02:51:06,048 --> 02:51:08,132
Good night, Joe.

1737
02:51:09,509 --> 02:51:11,385
Good night, Seligman.

1738
02:52:51,611 --> 02:52:53,320
No!

1739
02:52:55,657 --> 02:52:58,409
But you,
you fucked thousands of men.
