1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:05,627
Seriously, you idiots haven't
figured this out by now?

2
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:07,663
It all started when we
blew up the time pigs,

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,531
the Time Masters,

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,800
now history's all screwed
up, and it's up to us

5
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,268
to unscrew it up.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,405
Half the time, we screw
things up even worse.

7
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,308
So don't call us heroes,
we're something else.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,876
We're legends.

9
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:23,509
Who writes this crap anyway?

10
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:26,515
Previously on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

11
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:30,052
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

12
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:32,321
Yes, it was the spear
that was purportedly used

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,257
to penetrate the side of Christ
after he died on the cross.

14
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,894
And now, it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

15
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:41,296
Then what would the Speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

16
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:43,265
He could just go back and
change history himself.

17
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,235
Changes to history cause
timequakes and aberrations,

18
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:47,836
which we can undo.

19
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:50,205
Changes to reality,
however, those are permanent.

20
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:51,373
Who's coming for you?

21
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,574
It's not a who. It's a...

22
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:54,743
It's a what.

23
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:56,578
He can sense the Speed Force.

24
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,715
And it's trying to kill me.

25
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,453
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

26
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:08,123
from the first century and
a 22nd-century supercomputer.

27
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,092
A deep scan reveals
that Captain Hunter's

28
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:12,194
neural architecture
has been reprogrammed

29
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,829
with a new identity.

30
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,368
It's a mnemonic archive,
designed to store memories.

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,736
Rip Hunter's.

32
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,504
Including the locations
of the other pieces

33
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,139
of the spear, I hope.

34
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,608
We would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,944
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

36
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:31,079
to address some of his shortcomings.

37
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,548
Can I help you with something, soldier?

38
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,752
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

39
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:39,121
You, on the other hand...

40
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:45,360
Stand at ease.

41
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:48,713
Gentlemen, General Washington is dead.

42
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:49,898
Hooray!

43
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,634
Now, I know you would all like
nothing more than to return home

44
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:55,003
from these godforsaken colonies,

45
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:58,006
but the rebellion is not yet quelled.

46
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,476
The fight is not yet finished.

47
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:05,948
But that doesn't mean we have
to fight fair, now does it?

48
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,319
These Americans...

49
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:14,289
they call themselves patriots,

50
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,292
but they will die as traitors.

51
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:21,196
Grab yourselves a rifle, lads.

52
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:25,600
After all, it's Christmas.

53
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:32,941
You killed George Washington.

54
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,543
Yes, I know.

55
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,445
Well, that should get my
former teammates' attention,

56
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,314
and when they travel
back in time to save him,

57
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:41,316
I'll be there waiting
for them with open arms.

58
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,818
Well, not too open, I hope.

59
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,353
No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.

60
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,455
I have no lingering attachment.

61
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,857
Ah, in that case, kill them all,

62
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,193
collect their fragment
of the Spear of Destiny,

63
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,895
and bring it to me.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,768
Whoever knew time travel
would be so much fun?

65
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,750

66
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,113
How long till Lily's interface
tracks down another piece

67
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,242
of the Spear of Destiny?

68
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,749
I don't know. I'm beginning to think

69
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,684
our supercomputer is not so super.

70
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:17,119
I heard that.

71
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:19,554
You try processing 1.2
zettabytes of data.

72
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:22,324
Rip's probably being tortured
by the Legion of Doom right now.

73
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,626
The sooner we can locate
another piece of the spear,

74
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,762
the sooner we can set
a trap and rescue him.

75
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,830
I could always reroute
power to my sub-neural

76
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,366
processing unit by
shutting off life support.

77
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,769
Oh, you're lippy this morning, Gideon.

78
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:35,070
I like it.

79
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,905
I wasn't joking.

80
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:39,341
Old buddy, old pal?

81
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,209
New news, I found rat
droppings in my room.

82
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,677
And you're telling me this because?

83
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,279
'Cause rats follow
crumbs. Crumbs you drop

84
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,947
any time you eat anything.

85
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,082
What would you have me do then,

86
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,483
use a knife and fork?

87
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,552
I would have you
clean up after yourself.

88
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:51,820
We've been all over time.

89
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,623
That rat could have bubonic plague.

90
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,891
Ah!

91
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,395
I've overstepped. I see that now.

92
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,901
You know, I thought I was
gonna hate Ray's chore wheel,

93
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,803
but breakfast duty's kind of fun.

94
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,238
And it tastes way better
than a food fabricator.

95
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,474
- It feels almost normal.
- Right?

96
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,975
I don't know what day of the week it is.

97
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,777
That I don't know how they got used to.

98
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,879
See, that's the problem
with the Temporal Zone.

99
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,815
You don't know if it's Sunday.
You don't know if it's Monday.

100
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,917
And Sunday should feel
different than Monday.

101
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,819
I love what we do. I do.

102
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:27,289
It's just sometimes I just
wish I could get off this ship.

103
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,057
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:33,295
I just wanna breathe some
fresh air and see some trees.

105
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:36,098
You know, when I first
moved from Zambesi to D.C.,

106
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,433
I used go camping every weekend.

107
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,769
I just love being
outside, under the stars.

108
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,438
That sounds terrible
and cold and miserable.

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,808
I'm a city guy, and that does
not work for me whatsoever.

110
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,545
What, is there something on my face?

111
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:52,380
A little.

112
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,615
Can you please get it off?

113
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:54,950
Okay.

114
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,525
- Um... I should go get the...
- No, um...

115
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:09,898
Um, what was that?

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,367
Did you guys feel that timequake?

117
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,035
It must have been a monster aberration.

118
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:14,983
Gideon?

119
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,571
The shock wave's point of origin

120
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:19,307
was December 25th, 1776.

121
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,709
That's the night George Washington

122
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,344
led the Continental
Army across the Delaware.

123
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,631
- Huh.
- I'm afraid not.

124
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,982
General Washington was
murdered that Christmas.

125
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,383
This is a trap.

126
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,252
It's Chicago all over again.

127
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:33,855
Thawne and his buddies are
trying to lure us into 1776.

128
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,891
- Very effectively, I might add.
- Yeah.

129
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:39,161
You wish to speak, Mr.
Rory? I noticed the death

130
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,329
of our forefather hasn't
diminished your appetite.

131
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,198
Mm, Washington's a punk.

132
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,867
He led America to independence
and became its first President.

133
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:48,103
Well, without Washington,
America wouldn't have democracy.

134
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,971
Or "Hamilton".

135
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,574
If Washington's so cool,
why his he on the $1 bill

136
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:53,875
and Franklin's on the $100 bill?

137
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,310
Now he's cool.

138
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,245
He is cool, but he didn't lead the troops

139
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,847
across the Delaware in a sneak attack.

140
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,349
Washington did. And,
if that offensive fails,

141
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,885
the American Revolution
fails, and the United States

142
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,788
- ceases to exist.
- Like I said, trap.

143
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,924
Well, surely you're not
suggesting we do nothing.

144
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:11,826
No, we have to save Washington.

145
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:15,096
We just need to be careful about it.

146
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,933
Let's buckle up.

147
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,135
Wait, how do we even know
where to find Washington?

148
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:21,970
The night before crossing the Delaware,

149
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:25,006
Washington was in Pennsylvania
at the home of William Keith.

150
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,575
So we're just gonna
break into someone's house

151
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:29,177
- on Christmas Eve?
- Yep, just like Santa.

152
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,112
Keith would've thrown
a Christmas banquet

153
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,514
for Washington and his men.

154
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,549
Ooh, secret mission on Christmas Eve.

155
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,585
Congratulations, Mick, you just became

156
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,186
a private in the U.S. Army.

157
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:40,989
Nate, Amaya, you two will
pose as wealthy newlyweds

158
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:44,226
eager to make a contribution
to the revolutionary cause.

159
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,328
Jax and Stein, quarterback the mission

160
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,762
from the ship. At the
first sign of trouble,

161
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:48,923
you Firestorm up.

162
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:51,499
Ray, I need you to miniaturize
down in the ATOM suit...

163
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,402
A toy in a Christmas stocking.

164
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:56,071
And run reconnaissance.

165
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:59,841
All right, let's go save America.

166
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:30,352
A Christmas banquet
in 1776. This is so...

167
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:31,139
Stupid.

168
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,742
- Where's your Christmas spirit?
- Ho-ho-ho.

169
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,483
- Ah, you're from Boston.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,286
Tell me, are you familiar
with the Sons of Liberty?

171
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,255
Oh, intimately, my wife and I are avid...

172
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:50,458
We're... we're avid supporters.

173
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,527
This is your wife?

174
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,029
- Yes.
- We're newlyweds, actually.

175
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:55,463
Brand new.

176
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:57,599
Ah, well, they, um,
they certainly do things

177
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:00,769
differently up in Boston.

178
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,138
Could I interest you in
a glass of eggnog, ma'am?

179
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,040
Thanks.

180
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,144
It's got a kick.

181
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,979
It's my wife Martha's recipe.

182
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,281
A little heavy on the rum,
but, in these trying times,

183
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:16,051
I believe extra rum is warranted.

184
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,052
Martha...

185
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:20,522
You're George Washington.

186
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,057
At your service.

187
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:25,193
Now tell me, from which
of our 13 fair colonies

188
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:26,761
do you hail from?

189
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,229
The first one.

190
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,332
Get him out of there, Sara.

191
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,367
General Washington, we have to go.

192
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,703
I don't have time to explain,
but your life is in danger.

193
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,711
Hold position!

194
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:43,878
We need to go.

195
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,480
I will not retreat.

196
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,583
I insist.

197
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:50,385
Georgie, out the back, now.

198
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:52,354
You are a most unusual woman.

199
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,389
- Oh!

200
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,458
- Shall we dance?
- What?

201
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,352
Dip.

202
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,734
Merry Christmas!

203
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,077
Oof!

204
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:22,951
What happened to the power?

205
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,806
How would I know?

206
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,286
You're supposed to be the engineer.

207
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,489
Ah, oof. Oh.

208
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,491
Guys, my suit just died.

209
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,826
Guys? Hello?

210
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,262
Whoa, hey! Ah!

211
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,099
Nate, Nate!

212
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:41,703
Hey, hey, look down here!

213
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,238
Ray?

214
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,607
- My gun, it's fried!
- We should turn back.

215
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:47,909
Protecting you is our first priority.

216
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,184
Rip?

217
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,983
Rip.

218
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:58,453
- How did you get here?
- I don't like this.

219
00:09:58,455 --> 00:09:59,921
Rip.

220
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,456
Hello, Sara.

221
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,495
Good-bye, Sara.

222
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:08,530
Son of a bitch.

223
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:11,065
Mr. Rory, we meet again.

224
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,734
What the hell is wrong with you?

225
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,369
On the contrary, nothing has ever been

226
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,404
more right.

227
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:21,943
If anything, we're a bit
more alike now, aren't we?

228
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,111
Take them away!

229
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,514
Come on, hang in there,
Sara. Hang in there.

230
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,651
Don't worry, died once. Wasn't a fan.

231
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,753
We need Gideon's medical capabilities

232
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:52,789
to extract the bullet and
repair any internal damage.

233
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,392
If we merge, we can use
Firestorm's nuclear energy

234
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:57,560
to repair the time drive
and get Gideon back online.

235
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:58,862
Brilliant.

236
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:04,401
What's happening?

237
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,236
Whatever fried the ship
must've done the same thing

238
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,438
to our Quantum Splicer, like an EMP.

239
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,006
Which explains why Raymond is stuck

240
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,808
in a miniaturized state.

241
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,009
- Jax...
- I'll find another way

242
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,611
to get Gideon online, you just...

243
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:15,679
You just hang in there.

244
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,781
Jax...

245
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,749
it was Rip.

246
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:23,319
What? No, no, no, that's not possible.

247
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,789
The Legion must've
found some way to turn him.

248
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,524
No, they could never...

249
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:31,094
Well, apparently, they have,
but our mission remains clear.

250
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:33,163
- We must save Washington.
- And Rory.

251
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,898
That was implied.

252
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,834
Whatever the Legion's done
to Rip, we gotta get him back.

253
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:42,072
Jax, I'm putting you in charge.

254
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:44,007
Well... me? But, I...

255
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,875
You got this.

256
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:50,246
Sara? Sara!

257
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:52,749
- Grey, do something.
- She's still alive.

258
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:55,018
I'll try to stabilize
her, but we need Gideon.

259
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,554
I don't know how to be a Captain, man.

260
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,756
Yes, you do, Jefferson.

261
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,427
Okay.

262
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,634
Sara's still hanging on, and
Grey's taking care of her.

263
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:13,436
And she's put me in charge.

264
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:16,072
Me and mini Ray will work on
restoring the ship's power.

265
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:17,841
You and Amaya need to rescue Washington

266
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,409
so he can cross the Delaware.

267
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,878
Saving a President,
a nation, and Christmas.

268
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,080
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

269
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,784
Listen, Rip's out there too,
but his brain's been scrambled

270
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,786
by the Legion, so we
need to bring him back.

271
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,287
I mean, if he's been
brainwashed, then...

272
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:35,992
No, we gotta save him.
No matter what it takes.

273
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:37,293
Okay.

274
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,871
I'm gonna find that
skinny little Englishman

275
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:49,272
and strangle him to death.

276
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,307
You take the front, I take the rear.

277
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,344
If we face them now, they
will surely kill us, Private.

278
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,146
They're gonna kill us anyway.

279
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:58,882
If the British wanted us dead,
they'd have done it already.

280
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:01,451
When we reach camp, I will
talk to their commanding officer

281
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,353
and arrange a prisoner exchange.

282
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:04,921
There are rules to war.

283
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,890
Yeah, kill or be killed.

284
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:08,925
British high command
will treat us honorably,

285
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,594
just as I treat prisoners, with honor.

286
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,197
Now I know why
Franklin's on the $100 bill.

287
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,765
I bet you 100 yous you're wrong.

288
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:16,766
Excuse me?

289
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,368
Oh, forget it.

290
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,570
I hate Christmas.

291
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:23,072
Wait, so Rip became Phil,

292
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:25,175
and now he's Rip again, but evil?

293
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:26,910
They went this way.

294
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,077
How do you know that? Are you using

295
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,412
your magical animal powers?

296
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:30,847
No, I figured that out by following

297
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,115
Rory's trail of trash.

298
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,983
Huh.

299
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,351
Smell that fresh air?

300
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:36,653
We're outside. Back on the ship,

301
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,288
you said you wanted to be outside.

302
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,889
It's kind of hard to
appreciate the scenery

303
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:41,758
when you're tracking
George Washington at the eve

304
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,226
of the American Revolution.

305
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,227
Good point.

306
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,129
We are not in Kansas anymore.

307
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:47,730
Wait, I know that one.

308
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:50,099
That's from a movie called
"The Wizard of Oz".

309
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,535
Right, when I was a kid,
I would run out of the room

310
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,304
any time the flying monkeys come on.

311
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:56,606
I do not care for flying monkeys.

312
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:59,909
I saw that with Bobby Padusky.

313
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,846
Wait a minute, so
there was life before Rex?

314
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:05,281
What was wating like in 1939?

315
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,382
Dating?

316
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:07,417
You mean courting?

317
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,018
Okay, courting, yeah.

318
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,621
Well, Bobby was always
the perfect gentleman.

319
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,923
I never got to see the end of
"The Wizard of Oz" though.

320
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:15,792
He got freaked out by
the flying monkeys too, huh?

321
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,160
No, Hitler invaded Poland,

322
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:19,395
and the JSA had to ship out to Europe.

323
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:22,398
Hitler ruins everything.

324
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,767
Okay, the Time Core's
inside the engine room,

325
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,436
but with the power off, I can't get past

326
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:28,705
- the door security.
- This is where I come in.

327
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:31,274
I'll go through the main duct,
take a left at this L-bracket,

328
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:32,842
this vent opens into the engine room,

329
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,077
where I can flip the breaker.

330
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,445
I get that Rip is now somehow evil,

331
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:36,713
but does he really have to try to kill

332
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,014
Washington on Christmas?

333
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,349
Any progress?

334
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,350
No, we're working on it.

335
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,784
How's Sara?

336
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,853
I'm afraid she can't wait any longer.

337
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,755
We need to remove the bullet now.

338
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:46,756
Okay.

339
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,160
Uh, guys, what was that?

340
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,163
Someone's at the door.

341
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:55,665
Heave!

342
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,803
Put your backs into it! Heave!

343
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,605
It's Rip. He's trying to get in.

344
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,674
And thanks to his EMP,
every weapon on this ship

345
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,242
has been rendered useless.

346
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,344
No doubt the Legion has
tasked him with recovering

347
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,812
our fragment of the spear.

348
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,848
I'll handle Rip. You operate on Sara.

349
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,617
Damn it, Jefferson, I'm
a physicist, not a doctor.

350
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,686
And I'm a mechanic, not a Captain.

351
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,655
So I guess we're both
trying out new things today.

352
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:26,029
So what's dating like in 2017?
You still go to the movies?

353
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,498
Uh, sure, but, you know,
you gotta work up to it.

354
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,099
Two hours is a big-time commitment.

355
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,868
- It is?
- Yeah, nowadays,

356
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,536
we got dating down to a science.

357
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,538
There's an app on your
phone. If you like somebody,

358
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,206
you swipe right. If you
don't, you swipe left.

359
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,776
And if you both swipe right,
you send each other a message.

360
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:41,744
So you use a telephone to find a wife?

361
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,579
Wife? No, no wife.

362
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,881
People don't date for marriage.

363
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,984
They just date for, you know, fun.

364
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:49,218
Fun.

365
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,421
Okay, future history lesson.

366
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:53,723
Back in the 1960s, there
was a social movement

367
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,425
called the sexual revolution where women

368
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:56,726
could have sex for pleasure.

369
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:01,064
Nowadays, relationships
are just... chill.

370
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,899
- Chill?
- Yeah.

371
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:06,836
We're being watched.

372
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:13,009
- You sure you heard someone?
- Shh.

373
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:16,079
I mean, I hear the
sound of rushing water,

374
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:19,816
but I don't think
anyone else is out here.

375
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,618
Aah!

376
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,921
Hessians.

377
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,522
That's cool.

378
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,070
Nate?

379
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,631
The Hessians must've planned
to camp here for the night.

380
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,100
Oh, I'm so cold.
I've never been so cold.

381
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,537
- Why aren't you cold?
- 'Cause I'm stronger than you.

382
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,173
And I summoned the ashe
of a seal as I dove in.

383
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,775
Seals are cute.

384
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:06,477
You're suffering from hypothermia.

385
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,079
You're not thinking clearly.

386
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,047
You're not thinking
clearly. You're the one

387
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,850
who doesn't think seals are cute.

388
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:16,187
Whatever, I'm tired of arguing with you.

389
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,421
I'm just gonna take a nap.

390
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,423
No, Nathaniel, stay awake.

391
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:21,258
I'm awake. I'm up.

392
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,960
No, I'm not.

393
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:26,364
You need skin on skin contact.

394
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,199
My body heat will keep you warm.

395
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:31,736
This isn't how I pictured
getting you naked.

396
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,270
You pictured getting me naked?

397
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,039
Mm-hmm.

398
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,708
Nate? Nate?

399
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,778
Nate.

400
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,747
You're pretty.

401
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:48,285
And... and you're so warm.

402
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,121
You're so warm.

403
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,225
For England!

404
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:56,327
Come on, you bastards, heave!

405
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:03,067
And this is why I
avoided medical school.

406
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:07,004
All right, Martin, hold it together.

407
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,673
You can do this.

408
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:12,343
You have to do this.

409
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,746
Whoa, the ship looks a lot different

410
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:18,382
when you're the size
of an action figure.

411
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:38,502
Mm, it's good to be home.

412
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,438
Fan out.

413
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,074
Kill anyone you find.

414
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,962
Ooh, very clever.

415
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:41,198
Now, which one of my former
teammates could possibly

416
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,969
be fighting back, hmm?

417
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,471
Well, I believe Ms. Lance is dead.

418
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:49,473
Professor Stein is a
little over the hill

419
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,841
for these sort of shenanigans,

420
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:57,248
and Doctor Palmer is a trifle too small.

421
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,050
Give it up, Jax!

422
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:03,220
I taught you everything you
know about the Waverider.

423
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:13,531
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.

424
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:18,035
I know every nook and
cranny on this ship.

425
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,778
General Washington,
as I live and breathe.

426
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,014
Lieutenant General Cornwallis.

427
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,683
I would've preferred to meet
you on the field of battle.

428
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,919
I must give credit where credit is due.

429
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,288
I have a new colonel
who's most impressive.

430
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,356
One might say he's ahead of his time.

431
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,459
If you two are done yapping,
I'd like my last meal.

432
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:45,963
Take these men to my
tent, and have them well fed.

433
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,932
You'll both be hung in the morning.

434
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,501
Sounds exciting. What'd
I tell you, Georgie boy?

435
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:53,737
I am an officer in the
Continental Army, sir.

436
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,574
You must treat me as a prisoner of war

437
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:59,076
in a manner which is
befitting of my rank.

438
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,879
This is not a war. This is a rebellion.

439
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,447
And you will be hanged for treason

440
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:06,817
against King George III.

441
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:09,386
Wait, you mustn't punish him.

442
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:11,722
This man is only guilty
of following orders.

443
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,591
I'm guilty of a lot more than that.

444
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,660
He will be returned
to his regiment tomorrow

445
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,295
with news of your death.

446
00:21:40,953 --> 00:21:43,320
Is my underwear out there?

447
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:45,322
You weren't wearing any.

448
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,858
That's embarrassing.

449
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,693
Just so you know, that
water was very cold,

450
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,929
so if you happened to
have sneaked a peek,

451
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,330
it's not a fair representation of...

452
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,866
Nate, I wasn't looking down there.

453
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,808
Because that would be unprofessional.

454
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,971
We'll wait for our clothes
to dry and then continue

455
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,973
tracking Rory and Washington.

456
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,342
Wait.

457
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,544
You're gonna wait out there?

458
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:10,848
It's warm by the fire.

459
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,450
It's warmer in the tent.

460
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:16,253
If you're implying what
I think you're implying,

461
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,489
you don't think that's a little fast?

462
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,491
Even by your modern standards?

463
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,692
No.

464
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,732
I suppose, after all we've been through,

465
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,934
a kiss would seem quaint.

466
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:33,270
It would seem old-fashioned.

467
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:44,581
Mr. Jackson!

468
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,984
Man, this guy's really
starting to piss me off.

469
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:49,953
You can't run forever, Mr. Jackson.

470
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,442
Hmm, something tells
me I'm getting warmer.

471
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:17,281
Nope, colder.

472
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:22,319
Man, the Legion really
must've fried your brain.

473
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:23,887
I bet you couldn't
even find your own ass

474
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:25,989
with both hands and a flashlight.

475
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:29,393
I don't want to hurt you, Jax.

476
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:31,562
Yeah, says the guy who shot Sara.

477
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:33,564
A small price to pay
for the Spear of Destiny,

478
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:35,265
don't you think?

479
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:39,870
Imagine the power we would wield
if we reunited the fragments.

480
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:42,539
You mean Eobard Thawne.
You're just his errand boy.

481
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,109
It's a job that the Legion
will reward me handsomely for,

482
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:46,877
as they would you.

483
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,779
You think you can bribe me?

484
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,080
I'm not a traitor like you.

485
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:51,515
There's nothing you could offer me.

486
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:54,752
What, not even your father's life?

487
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:57,087
Think about it, Jax.

488
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:01,425
The spear allows us to rewrite reality.

489
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:04,094
Now, if you were to help
me, your father no longer

490
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,796
has to ship off to battle.

491
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,157
He would no longer have
to die in that ambush.

492
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,335
Your mother would no longer
be a widow, and you...

493
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:13,036
The only way you're getting that spear

494
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,239
is by prying it from
my cold, dead hands.

495
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,673
Oh, well, that works too.

496
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:31,321
When they change shifts,
I'm gonna bust us out of here.

497
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,123
Are you really so anxious to die?

498
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,191
I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.

499
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:37,427
That's why I'm taking you with me.

500
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:38,795
I'd rather die a gentleman

501
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:41,498
than return to Mount Vernon a scoundrel.

502
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,566
I trust that I may depend
on you to deliver this

503
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:45,502
to my wife, Martha?

504
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:49,572
Consider it a last request.

505
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:53,810
Listen, you fop. You can
give it to her yourself.

506
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:56,546
Or are you too much of a pansy?

507
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:59,749
I've been a soldier
since I was 20 years old,

508
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,619
but our cause is the cause of all men:

509
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,921
to be treated equally, regardless

510
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,323
of hereditary privilege.

511
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:09,192
We must prove to the
world that you don't need

512
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:12,061
a title to be a gentleman.

513
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:15,665
The British may be
dishonorable, but I am not.

514
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,901
By my death, I will prove to the Crown

515
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:20,103
what it means to be an American.

516
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:24,040
You don't know the first thing
about being an American.

517
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:29,379
We're misfits, outcasts,
and we're proud of it.

518
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:32,282
If they attack in formation,
we pop them off from the trees.

519
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:35,685
If they challenge you to a duel,
you raid their camp at night.

520
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,154
And if they're gonna
hang you, you fight dirty

521
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:41,491
and you never, ever give up.

522
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:44,093
That's the American way.

523
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:46,729
What's it gonna be, George?

524
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:02,612
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:06,516
How long were we asleep?

526
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:07,817
Maybe an hour?

527
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,252
- An hour?
- Yeah.

528
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:11,521
What about General Washington and Rory?

529
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:14,390
All right, slow down.

530
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:15,692
We have to go.

531
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:17,927
I'm up, just need to get dressed,

532
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,898
unless you think we have
time for, you know...

533
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,335
We have a job to do.

534
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:32,375
Okay, please don't let this kill me.

535
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,280
Ah, you managed to turn
on the auxiliary power,

536
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:38,882
Mr. Jackson. Well done.

537
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:41,584
Hey, come on, man.

538
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,219
You're Captain Rip Hunter.

539
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:45,355
The man who recruited a
bunch of reject super heroes

540
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:46,956
to not save his family?

541
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:50,126
Don't tell me you miss
that self-righteous idiot.

542
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,996
This isn't you.

543
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:54,531
Whatever the Legion's done to turn you

544
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,698
into their puppet, you...

545
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,534
Captain Rip Hunter was the puppet!

546
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:00,703
First of the Time Masters,
and then to some misguided duty

547
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,505
to protect history.

548
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:04,474
Can't you see, Jax?

549
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:07,744
My new allies, they freed me.

550
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,715
Looks like this will
be your last Christmas.

551
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:16,519
Wait, I know where the
piece of the spear is.

552
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:20,223
Hmm. Smart play.

553
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,660
Show me.

554
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,344
Oh, rats.

555
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,117
You're a good man, Rip.

556
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,819
Even when you disappeared, we carried on

557
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,321
because that's what you wanted.

558
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,022
No, because the old Rip
was a fool for believing

559
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:56,259
that time is worth saving,
and you were even bigger fools

560
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,627
for believing him.

561
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:00,630
Now, my patience is wearing thin.

562
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,432
Where's the spear fragment?

563
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:05,668
In the same place you left it.

564
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,804
Humph.

565
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:10,540
I think I'll let you do the honors.

566
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:18,715
Oh, you.

567
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,222
I underestimated you, Jax.

568
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:30,293
And I won't make that mistake again.

569
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,785
Aw.

570
00:28:55,787 --> 00:29:00,456
Well, I'm sorry to
interrupt this tender moment.

571
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:18,274
- Get away from her.
- Not another step.

572
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:23,146
Now, one last time, where's
the piece of the spear?

573
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:27,550
Don't make me ask you again.

574
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm not telling you nothing.

575
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,922
Very well.

576
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:36,325
There's no reason both of
you have to die tonight.

577
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,629
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

578
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:42,365
The piece of the spear's
inside your telescope.

579
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:45,601
Now just... just let her go.

580
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,004
Rip.

581
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:50,640
Rip, it's Sara.

582
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:53,142
Come on, it's Sara.

583
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,885
You say her name as if she's
supposed to matter to me.

584
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,556
She doesn't.

585
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,868
No, no, no, no, no. Sara, Sara.

586
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:43,030
Honest to a fault, Jax.

587
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:52,039
Jefferson?

588
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,341
I told him.

589
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:58,212
I told him where to find
the piece of the spear.

590
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:01,215
He just killed her anyway.

591
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:02,850
Where's Raymond?

592
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:05,753
It's too late.

593
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:07,721
Where are you going?

594
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:09,857
I'm gonna find Rip,
and I'm gonna kill him.

595
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,158
No, Jefferson, wait.

596
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,927
Raymond, if you can hear me,

597
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,162
you must get the main power online.

598
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,932
Without Gideon, I can't save her.

599
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,168
This is why we have a chore wheel!

600
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,114
Whoa!

601
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:38,152
Whoa, that is a long way down,

602
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:39,887
but you weren't captain

603
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:42,223
of the varsity diving team for nothing.

604
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:44,225
Oh, man.

605
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:46,827
Three, two, one.

606
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,965
One! Come on.

607
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:52,299
Whoa! Aah!

608
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,969
Yes! Ha!

609
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:57,638
Hello, Professor, how
can I be of assistance?

610
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,106
Gideon, thank God.

611
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:01,108
Ms. Lance is, uh, how
shall I put this...

612
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,109
Dead?

613
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:03,677
Delicate, as always.

614
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,146
Luckily, her brain
cells are still functioning.

615
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:09,550
Let's see what I can do, shall we?

616
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,254
Um, guys? A little help here?

617
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:16,090
Guys? Hello?

618
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:20,861
Any last words?

619
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:24,665
In fact, I've learned a
new word from my Private.

620
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:26,834
Kaboom.

621
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,412
Take them down!

622
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:41,315
All right.

623
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,057
Come on, Georgie boy.

624
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:53,761
Whoa.

625
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,998
If you're expecting me to
blink, it's gonna be a long day.

626
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,601
Oof!

627
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,372
A gentleman would stay and fight,

628
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,841
but as an American, I suggest we run.

629
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,085
Don't move!

630
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,222
You haven't got it in you.

631
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:23,924
You didn't have to kill her.

632
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:26,994
Sara wasn't supposed to die,
not like that, not by you.

633
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:31,398
There's no rhyme nor
reason to any of this, Jax.

634
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
History is war and slavery

635
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,902
and holding your dead son in your arms.

636
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:37,571
There's no point in protecting history,

637
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:40,541
so we might as well
just burn it all down.

638
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:42,276
I haven't got all day for this.

639
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:45,879
If you're gonna shoot me,
then, please, get on with it.

640
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:49,083
I will make it easier for you.

641
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,192
No?

642
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,627
Well, it's just as I thought.

643
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,063
You're weak.

644
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:06,367
Just like your old Captain.

645
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:08,569
Don't.

646
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,704
Sara?

647
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,740
What?

648
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:16,176
Gideon and Stein saved me.

649
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:20,381
It looks like Rip put
together a pretty good team.

650
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:21,849
Will you put the gun down, Jax?

651
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,217
No.

652
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,285
I think you should listen to your friend.

653
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,787
Shut up!

654
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,455
He's with the Legion now.

655
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:31,592
The Rip we know is gone.

656
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:35,896
You know what day it is, Jax?

657
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:39,233
It's December 25th.

658
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:42,369
It's Christmas.

659
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,607
It's when we remember
to be our best selves.

660
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,543
Why are you protecting him?

661
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,047
I'm not protecting him.

662
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,215
I'm protecting you.

663
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:58,952
Gah.

664
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:04,358
Speaking of Christmas miracles,

665
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,760
the British are coming.

666
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,332
To fighting like an American.

667
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:25,400
I always do.

668
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:31,073
Ah, it's not bad.

669
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:33,075
Listen, Georgie,

670
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,544
I got some thoughts on the
criminal justice system...

671
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:36,812
This is last of them.

672
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,547
You should be back to a fair fight now.

673
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:40,882
Your troops are waiting for
you outside, General Washington.

674
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:42,718
I don't understand
much of what I've seen,

675
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,388
but the world is changing.

676
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,291
And you are no small part of that.

677
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,426
Sir.

678
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:54,463
Well, Georgie, it's...
It's been a pleasure.

679
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,533
But, uh...

680
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,102
Mm.

681
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:04,339
Oh, uh, you can deliver
this love letter yourself.

682
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:05,707
This is no love letter.

683
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:09,478
It's a battle strategy.

684
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,246
I wanted to ensure my
men would receive it

685
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:13,248
in the event of my death.

686
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,850
The Hessians will be receiving

687
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,485
a Christmas surprise this evening.

688
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:18,286
Ah, you sneaky bastard.

689
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,023
You're not such a gentleman after all.

690
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:23,392
Your rebel spirit, your steadfastness,

691
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:27,562
your crass yet effective
use of language,

692
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:30,899
you, Mr. Rory, represent the best

693
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,169
of what our new nation can be.

694
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,239
Yes, yes, I do.

695
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,240
All right.

696
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:43,345
Gideon, is the American Revolution

697
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:44,613
back on track?

698
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:46,648
Yes, history has been restored.

699
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,150
Though there is now

700
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,751
a statue in the nation's capital

701
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,353
that bears a striking resemblance

702
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:54,089
to Mr. Rory.

703
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:02,264
So, how you feeling, Captain?

704
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:05,067
Good, considering.

705
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,270
Well, it's good to have you back.

706
00:37:08,272 --> 00:37:11,740
And I think I'm just about done
being in charge for a while.

707
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:13,542
Oh, I don't know.

708
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:15,710
I think you did a pretty good job.

709
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:17,813
I told Rip where to find
the piece of the spear.

710
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,081
I...

711
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,217
How do you do it?

712
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:26,288
How do you make the right
choice even when there isn't one?

713
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:34,229
You remember the mission.

714
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:38,433
And what you're fighting for.

715
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:42,003
And you try to hold on to your humanity.

716
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,605
And surround yourself with people

717
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:45,674
who remind you of that,

718
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,742
even in your darkest hour.

719
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:56,384
- Gah!
- Whoa!

720
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:57,719
Whoo!

721
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:04,659
Well, would you care to do the honors?

722
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,728
You certainly know
your way around a knife.

723
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,797
Well, the League never covered poultry,

724
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,365
but I'll give it a shot.

725
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,033
Ouch!

726
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,668
Whoa!

727
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,604
I'm certainly glad
to be human sized again.

728
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:17,405
Man, it's good to have you back.

729
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:20,509
This Christmas dinner idea?
It might be your best one yet.

730
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:21,910
It makes it feel kind of like home.

731
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,346
Yeah, right down to the drunk uncle.

732
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:27,349
Careful, Haircut.
I'm your forefather now.

733
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:30,485
- That's true.
- Hey, I got you a gift.

734
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:32,954
Ah.

735
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,923
Dude, the hell?

736
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:37,125
A rat.

737
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,527
We made friends.

738
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,228
- I got you something too.
- No, no, no, no, no.

739
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,164
If that's a mouse, then I'm good, homie.

740
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,171
Hey, I had the Fabrication Room

741
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,473
- working overtime on this.
- Nathaniel...

742
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:53,208
What? Can't one teammate get another

743
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,177
a perfectly meaningless gift?

744
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,411
Is this meaningless?

745
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:58,647
I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

746
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,116
Look, I'm glad last night happened.

747
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:02,918
- It was fun.
- It was a lot of fun.

748
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,420
But I still think teammates
shouldn't fraternize.

749
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:08,423
I totally agree.

750
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,259
This is what you wanted, right?

751
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:14,095
I mean, you said the future was "chill."

752
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:18,900
Me, I am the ambassador of chill.

753
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:20,802
Merry Christmas, Amaya.

754
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,672
Yeah.

755
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,519
All right, Merry Christmas,
Happy Holidays,

756
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:41,923
and whatever people say who
exist outside the timeline.

757
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:45,627
Now, I know that it may seem like

758
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:48,129
we don't have anything to celebrate.

759
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:50,599
Rip's been brainwashed
and took our piece

760
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,567
of the Spear of Destiny.

761
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:56,738
There's a monument in
Washington D.C. to Rory.

762
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,076
But... we saved America,

763
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:03,645
and we're gonna save Rip

764
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:06,681
and get back the rest of the spear,

765
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:11,152
because as powerful
as the Legion may be,

766
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:14,689
they don't have this.

767
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:16,858
Family.

768
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,962
And we all know nobody
fights like family.

769
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:22,964
Here, here.

770
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:23,999
Cheers.

771
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,433
To family.

772
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:32,254
