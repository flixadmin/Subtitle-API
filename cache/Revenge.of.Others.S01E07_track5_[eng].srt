1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,091
Chanmi.

2
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,553
I didn't kill him.

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,929
I'm being honest.

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,350
Hey, this isn't even funny.

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,438
Hey, Chanmi.

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,689
What are you doing?

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,066
I think you're misunderstanding something.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,110
You can take the bag to the police.

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,738
It wasn't me.

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,989
I didn't kill him.

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,863
What do you think you're doing right now?

12
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,239
Have you gone mad?

13
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,324
Hey, explain this to me.
What are you trying to do?

14
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,659
Don't move!

15
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,037
Hey, come on! Why are you doing this?!

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,749
Okay, fine.
With Sa Junggyeong, that was me.

17
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,251
I'm the one who crushed his foot.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,630
But what does that have to do with you?

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,425
I didn't kill
that damn juvenile delinquent!

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,760
Why did you kill...

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
my older brother?

22
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,604
What did you say?

23
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,774
You think I killed Wonseok?

24
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,193
Shut up! You bastard!

25
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,319
There's evidence.

26
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,571
Why would I kill him, why?

27
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,657
You're the one
who should be answering that question.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,866
Why did you?

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,868
Why did you kill him, why?

30
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,080
You demonic bastard.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,543
How dare you smile at me
after killing my brother?

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,545
How dare you even talk to me?

33
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,964
You deserve to die.

34
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,347
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Please just stop!

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,683
Stop it!

36
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,030
If I'm the one that killed Wonseok,
then I'll kill myself.

37
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,202
If you really believe that I killed him,

38
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,539
I'll go ahead and kill myself.

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,708
So tell me.

40
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,710
Did I kill him?

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,422
Answer me!

42
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,216
Do you think I killed Wonseok?

Osung.

57
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,854
Was I the one

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,148
who killed Park Wonseok?

59
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,661
Jaebum.

60
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,329
Why would you have killed Park Wonseok?

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,123
It's just not true.
Why would you think that?

62
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
Jaebum, what did I tell you

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,419
when you brought that photo
of you and Park Wonseok to school?

64
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,045
Didn't I tell you?
You didn't even know Park Wonseok.

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,840
How could I not know him if we had taken
a polaroid picture like that

66
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,924
at this race track?

67
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,968
That's why I'm suspecting.

68
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,011
Maybe you're lying to me

69
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,679
because I did something bad
to Park Wonseok.

70
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,596
Jaebum.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,100
How far back can you remember?

72
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,311
How far?

73
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,771
Is your memory
slowly coming back to you these days?

74
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,817
I think so.

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,444
Don't trust your memory, Jaebum.

76
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,196
You'll be in big trouble
if you do, seriously.

77
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,032
Your memories might not be real.

78
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,117
You never know
if it's just part of your imagination,

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,452
so don't trust your memories.

80
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,996
So are you saying

81
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,206
that it wasn't a suicide
and that it was in fact a car accident?

82
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,585
Where did it happen?
What kind of accident was it?

83
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,046
Was it a car collision? Was I jaywalking?

84
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,881
It's true that you were trying
to commit suicide.

85
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,467
You...

86
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,302
jumped.

87
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,638
Don't tell your parents
your memory came back.

88
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,265
It was actually your parents

89
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,893
who decided to tell you
that it was a car accident.

90
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,687
Where did I jump from?

91
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,397
From the building
of your parents' company nearby.

92
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,649
Why?

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,944
Do you know the reason why?

94
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,697
No, I don't.
I don't know why you tried to jump.

95
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,657
There was no suicide note.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,203
Osung.

97
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,999
What exactly happened
between me and Park Wonseok?

98
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,795
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,922
This seems like a breakthrough.

100
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,423
Regarding what happened

101
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,801
between you and Park Wonseok
the incident...

102
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
There's something I need to show you.

103
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,516
It's at home, so I'll bring it
with me the next time I see you.

Make sure you go see a doctor.

120
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,440
And if the doctor asks me how I got hurt,
should I tell him I was shot?

121
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,901
Why don't you just tell them
you messed with some bullies on the street

INCOMING CALL
SA JUNGGYEONG

137
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,745
Jaebum, sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,372
Hey.

139
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,167
Why were you playing basketball
when you were supposed to meet with me?

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,794
Sorry.

141
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,504
It's just that if I didn't join,
they wouldn't have been able to play.

142
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,963
It was three against three.

143
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,674
Then you could have called...

144
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
So, do you remember now?

145
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,222
Do you remember why you committed suicide?

146
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,394
Can you really not remember?

147
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
Memories aren't something
you can bring back

148
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,356
just because you think hard and focus.

149
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,692
Well, maybe it will just pop up randomly?

150
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
With some sort of a triggering event
or a shock?

151
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,615
I did exactly
what you told me to do, Osung.

152
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,702
I went back to the office building
near the horse track,

153
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,372
but I couldn't remember anything at all.

154
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,210
I couldn't remember
why I had jumped from there.

155
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,003
By the way,

156
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,464
how were you able to realize
that it wasn't a traffic accident

157
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
and that you had
actually attempted suicide?

158
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
I guess the feeling of floating mid-air?

159
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,851
For a very long time...

160
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,980
And that fear of falling.

161
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,860
That feeling resurfaced like a nightmare.

162
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,239
That's why I thought

163
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,950
maybe that's what had happened.

164
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,828
You haven't told your parents about this,
have you?

165
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,205
No.

166
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,378
Osung.

167
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,465
Thank you.

168
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,927
You're the only one I can trust.

169
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,346
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

170
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,475
Come on, you're making me feel awkward.
You don't have to thank me.

171
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
You said...

172
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,235
you had something to show me concerning

173
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,237
what happened
between Park Wonseok and me, right?

174
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,585
Jaebum.

175
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,295
I have it here in my bag.

176
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,090
Are you prepared
to take whatever comes out of it?

177
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,928
What do you mean? What is it?

178
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,856
This envelope...

179
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
The thing inside this envelope...

180
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,820
was once yours.

181
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,536
You asked me to hold onto this a few days
before you tried to commit suicide.

182
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,455
I asked you to hold onto this for me?

183
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,749
You told me not to open it
under any circumstances.

184
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,960
But after you jumped,

185
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,087
you lost consciousness
and weren't waking up.

186
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,673
So I opened it.

187
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,925
I feel really bad about that.

188
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,878
So, Jaebum,

189
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,298
that's why I told you

190
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,175
not to mention Park Wonseok to anyone.

191
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,826
What are you going to do now?

192
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
Well, the last train has left by now.

193
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,580
I'll have to catch the train
early tomorrow morning

194
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,748
and head back to Seoul.

195
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,459
That's not what I meant.

196
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,878
I mean, what are you going to do
about the body shop murder?

197
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,505
You've been framed as the suspect.

198
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,510
Well, I'm not actually being framed,
I'm just a suspect.

199
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,804
What do you call it, a person of interest?

200
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,726
Had it not been for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

201
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,022
I would've been investigated
as the suspect for a murder case.

202
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
All we can do is hope
that the real culprit will be caught.

203
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,235
By the way, how did you know?

204
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,529
That the police were looking
for the backpack?

205
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,660
Gi Osung told me.

206
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,328
Gi Osung?

207
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,338
Gi Osung.

208
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,050
I heard you manipulated Park Wonseok
after learning about his weaknesses.

209
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,928
I'm here because I wanted
to hear you elaborate on that.

210
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,639
Is that why you've been waiting
for me in front of my house?

211
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,558
Do you really need to bring up the past?
Wonseok isn't here with us anymore.

212
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,520
I need to find the person
who killed my older brother.

213
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,605
How is the fact
that I manipulated Park Wonseok

214
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,899
related to his murder?

215
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,943
That's why I'm asking you to explain.

216
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,697
Do you think I'm the one who killed him?

217
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,742
Before I actually catch the killer,

218
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,495
everyone is a suspect in my eyes.

219
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,163
The police are tracking down
the suspect now.

220
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,707
What?

221
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,333
When I went to visit my father
at the police station,

222
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,668
I came across this information
by accident.

223
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,754
Several days ago, there was a murder.

224
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,756
And the police think that the suspect

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,592
is the same one who was behind
the dark room assault at our school.

226
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,094
They say it's highly likely

227
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,804
that it's the same person
behind Park Wonseok's case.

228
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,139
They're about to catch the suspect.

229
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,726
What do you mean
they're about to catch the suspect?

230
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,977
It seems they spotted him
on some surveillance footage

231
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,770
at the scene of the crime a few days ago.

232
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,647
I watched the surveillance myself.

233
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,566
So...

234
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,486
I guess they've identified the suspect.

235
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,863
Just his back.

236
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,407
All they have is a photo of him
wearing a backpack.

237
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,909
They said it won't take long
before they catch him.

238
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,414
Suddenly,
I recalled that image of you

239
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,124
when I ran into you in the alley.

240
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,127
I remember thinking it was odd
that you were wearing a backpack

241
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,880
even though you told me you were
on your way back from working out.

242
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,972
What the...

243
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,324
JI SOOHEON

244
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,130
GOGO STADIUM

245
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,675
GOGO STADIUM MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION
NOW OPEN

246
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,600
I thought to myself
that I shouldn't let the police catch you.

247
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,811
Because if you had been caught,

248
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,730
from that point on, I wouldn't have had
the chance to confront you directly.

249
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,900
I wouldn't have been able to ask you
why you did it.

250
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,443
I also wouldn't have been able to...

251
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,364
kill you with my own two hands.

252
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,867
So I thought it'd be better
not to let the police catch you,

253
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,330
until I had the chance
to catch you myself.

254
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,290
I did almost die at your hands.

255
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,583
If you hadn't received that call...

256
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,837
Hey, how can you laugh
and joke about what happened?

257
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,342
Life and death is not a big deal.

258
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,553
There's only a small difference
between the two.

259
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
Now's not the time for such talk.

260
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,306
Looking ahead...

261
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,227
Death isn't what's waiting
for us after life.

262
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,690
It's more like life and death
are running along parallel tracks.

263
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,403
You can die just by slightly veering
to the other side.

264
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,072
Come on, stop being weird.

265
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,699
Why would you have
any reason to talk about death?

266
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,412
You do realize that I was almost shot
to death today, right?

267
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,456
Damn, come on.

268
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,420
What I mean is, we have to keep on living.

269
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,465
Even when you reach the brink of death,
if you're able to surpass that moment,

270
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,885
your life will continue to go on.

271
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,722
We should do whatever we can to survive.

272
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,351
That's the only responsibility
we have in life.

273
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,146
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

274
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,774
Sorry.

275
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,118
The person that called earlier...

276
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,164
They must be the culprit, right?

277
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,168
That must have been the culprit.

278
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,922
That person must have picked up
my brother's phone

279
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,173
after pushing him out the window.

280
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,383
Why would they turn on the cell phone?

281
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,178
They should know
that it can be tracked down.

282
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,014
Why did they call me with his cell phone?

283
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,642
They must've been keeping
an eye on me, right?

284
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,187
Do you think they were just
trying to mess around with me?

285
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,897
Are they trying to have fun with this?

286
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,109
That son of a bitch.

287
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,696
What are you going to do about the police?

288
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
Are you going to tell them

289
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,700
you got a phone call
from Wonseok's cell phone?

290
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,952
No.

291
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,919
The person you dialed cannot be reached...

292
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,587
CALL ENDED
JI SOOHEON

293
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,762
The person you dialed cannot be reached.

294
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,056
-Please record the message after the tone.
-Soyeon.

295
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,267
Hey, why are you so startled?

296
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,645
You have such a loud voice.
How could I not be startled?

297
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,523
I was going to introduce
you guys formally,

298
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,941
but I guess this is how it goes.

299
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,484
This is my boyfriend.

300
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,069
Why don't you say hello?

301
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,571
-It's nice to meet you, I'm...
-Aren't you Bang Wootak?

302
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,074
Oh my, what? How did you know?

303
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,953
-He's completely disguised.
-You can just tell he's an idol star.

304
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,833
It's nice to finally meet you.

305
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,168
I've heard a lot about you from Ajung.

306
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,046
Come to think of it, you don't strike me
so much as an idol star.

307
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,214
You're giving me more daddy vibes.

308
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,717
Hey, Soyeon, do you really need
to embarrass him like that?

309
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,926
You barely just met.

310
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,013
In any case, if you do so much
as scratch Ajung, you better watch out.

311
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,142
I'll make sure you never work
in the entertainment industry ever again.

312
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,228
I don't know why she's being this way.

313
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,479
I don't know why she's so mad.

314
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,605
Don't worry.

315
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,149
After my contract expires this fall,

316
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,234
I'm going to retire
and fulfill my military service.

317
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,112
Then we'll live together
as a happy family. Just the three of us.

318
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,364
You can say all you want now, but...

319
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,159
regardless, you'll be forced to retire
if you ever go back on your word.

320
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,368
You can take my word for it.

321
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,203
I don't know what's gotten into her.

322
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,290
Soyeon, I hope you'll continue
to look out for Ajung

323
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,000
with the same loyalty you have
for her now.

324
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,044
I'm never going to change.

325
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,798
-Oh no, what to do...
-Oh, my cutie pie.

326
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,135
Ah, she must be emotional
from all the hormones.

327
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,471
-Are you okay?
-I'm just so touched.

328
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,680
You're so silly.

329
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,267
Don't cry, okay, sweetie?

330
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,195
Did you say your parents went down south?

331
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,490
Yeah, they'll be away
for a while for work.

332
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,618
In that case, maybe I'll stay here
for a while doing prenatal care.

333
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,453
Fine.

334
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,708
You must be tired
from your date today. Rest up.

335
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,710
Hey, Soyeon.

336
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,629
I just thought of this, but...

337
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,090
wouldn't it be fun if the four of us
went out on a double date?

338
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,883
What are you talking about?
I don't have a boyfriend.

339
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,055
You have Ji Sooheon. Just grab him
by the collar and drag him along.

340
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,181
Are you out of your mind?

341
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,475
It's time you already started dating.

342
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,852
It's obvious you have feelings for him,
so just bring him along.

343
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,647
He'll be excited about it as well.

344
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,565
If I were to cuss you out
in a five-minute rap battle,

345
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,651
that wouldn't be good
for your prenatal care, would it?

346
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,444
You punk. I'm going to take a shower.

347
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,240
I already know you've been worried
for the past few days.

348
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,493
-I know it's because of Ji Sooheon.
-Shut the heck up.

349
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,713
CLEAN, HYGIENIC LAUNDROMAT 24/7

350
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,889
What are you going to do now?

351
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
Well, I guess
it will all work out somehow.

352
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,772
What do you mean it will all work out?
You're being framed as a murder suspect.

353
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,692
There's nothing I can do about it.

354
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,528
Plus, I did commit a crime.

355
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,573
What you did wasn't a crime.

356
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,741
It was.

357
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,952
I assaulted someone.

358
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,958
I wasn't planning to be a hero,
or whatever everyone else was calling it.

359
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,835
No.

360
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,338
I'm no hero.

361
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,842
I just needed the money.

362
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,012
Money to pay for my mom's medical bills.

363
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,600
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You don't need to do that.

364
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,352
You did the right thing.

365
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,900
How did I end up like this?

366
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,319
If you were to ask me yesterday,

367
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,237
I could never have imagined

368
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,780
that I'd be sitting
in a laundromat in Busan.

369
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,616
The same goes for me.

370
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,871
When you make a snowman,

371
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,166
first you insert a stone
to form a snowball.

372
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,753
That's me.

373
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,255
I'm the stone.

374
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,302
I feel like someone inserted me
into a snowball,

375
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,472
and that I'm just being rolled
into something bigger.

376
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,352
The more it rolls, the bigger it gets.

377
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,440
To the point where it's too big for me
to get myself out of it.

378
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,818
A snowball
that's gotten too big to escape.

379
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,446
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

380
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,615
I'm sorry, okay?

381
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,788
I heard a phone ringing.

382
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,748
What?

383
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,708
When the culprit called me.

384
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,004
Hello.

385
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,339
CALL_RECORDING_OK_CHANKYU_00_16_25

386
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,009
Hello?

387
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,679
Who is this?

388
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,557
Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?

389
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,725
Hello? Hell...

390
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,178
SELF LAUNDROMAT 24/7

391
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,400
FORGET I WAS IN BUSAN.
THANKS.

392
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,777
Forget I was in Busan.

393
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,196
Thanks.

394
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,578
SEOUL
YONGSAN SINCHON

395
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,580
Hello? Hello?

396
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,023
What's with that guy? What's going on?

397
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,984
It's nothing. He's just a detective.

398
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,653
Detective? For Park Wonseok's case?

399
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,864
Oh, right.
There's Sa Junggyeong's case too.

400
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,242
-Is he here to catch the suspect?
-Don't stare at him so much. Let's go.

401
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,370
Hey, watch it! You're dealing
with a pregnant woman, okay?

402
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,705
You crazy...

403
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,307
Oh, may I help you with anything?

404
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,516
Oh.

405
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,312
I'm a detective
at the Yongtan Police Station.

406
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,858
Ji Sooheon parks his bike here
when he comes to school, right?

407
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,234
That's right. Why do you ask?

408
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,737
He was absent yesterday
and didn't come back home.

409
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,905
And he's not at school yet.

410
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,573
Oh, Sooheon's phone's been off.

411
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,033
What's going on?

412
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,535
That's what we're eager
to find out as well.

413
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,747
Do you know where we might find Sooheon?

414
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,374
It seems he hasn't been at the gym either.

415
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,053
Oh, okay.

416
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,347
Hey, Chanmi, have you seen Sooheon?

417
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,140
Why can't I reach him?

418
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,517
Uh...

419
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,698
It seems you've become quite friendly
with Sooheon.

420
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,700
We're in the same class.

421
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,453
When did you start living
on the rooftop above the gym?

422
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
Am I not allowed to be living up there?

423
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
You sound a bit emotional today.

424
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,338
Are you making any progress
tracking down your brother's murderer?

425
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,466
Are you being sarcastic?

426
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,303
That was scary.
I don't know how to respond to that.

427
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,639
I need to go to school.

428
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,225
The police are the ones
who catch criminals.

429
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,352
If you know of anything,
or find anything suspicious,

430
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,645
come to the police.

431
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,232
That's the fastest way
we'll catch the killer.

432
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,233
Okay.

433
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,068
If the police had done a better job,

434
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,945
we'd probably be
in a better situation by now.

435
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,948
Good luck.

436
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,581
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to stay so close to Ji Sooheon.

437
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,559
If I don't show up again
for the next couple of days,

438
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,728
could you take care of him for me?

439
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,751
All rise. Bow.

440
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,461
Good morning.

441
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,340
Seok Jaebum is absent today again.

442
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,175
Is he sick?

443
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,386
-Osung, can you check on how he's doing?
-Yes, sir.

444
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,265
All right.
There are still police officers on campus.

445
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,226
Let me give you all another warning.

446
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,022
Don't make up any fake news,
and don't spread any rumors.

447
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,275
Anyways, all of us in class 4,
let's not get distracted.

448
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,445
Let's all have a good day today, yeah!

449
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,488
Yes, sir.

450
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,406
-Let's do this!
-Yes, sir.

451
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,537
Wow, even a third-generation
multimillionaire is cutting school, huh?

452
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,457
People are all the same.

453
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,334
Isn't that right?

454
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,087
Hey, are you ignoring me?

455
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,306
Ok Chanmi,
your suspension is finally over.

456
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,517
Mind your manners and stay on track.

457
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,518
Yes, sir.

458
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,229
And where did Ji Sooheon go?
His cell phone is off.

459
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,355
Does anyone want to volunteer
to check up on him?

460
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,564
-Kook Jihyun does.
-Kook Jihyun does.

461
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,483
Good. Jihyun, please check on him.

462
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,651
Yes, sir.

463
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,778
When will Ji Sooheon grow up?

464
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,031
Now, you are the most
valuable person in your world.

465
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,825
And the only way
to take care of yourselves

466
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,953
is to study, you guys! That's it!

467
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,346
Congratulations on making it through
your suspension.

468
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,807
Why don't we try to get along
until we graduate?

469
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,643
It'll be great.
It'll be just like living in hell.

470
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
You might want to leave, but you can't

471
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,773
because you need to find
your brother's killer.

472
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,734
Hellish

473
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,694
school days.

474
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,766
While you were unlocking
Ji Sooheon's locker at the gym,

475
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,976
I had just arrived at the gym.

476
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,984
That's when I saw Ok Chanmi
running down the stairs in a hurry.

477
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,865
So what you're saying is that Ok Chanmi
took Ji Sooheon's backpack?

478
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,242
She helped the suspect,

479
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,828
who might've killed her brother,
hide his evidence?

480
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,039
That's the question on my mind as well.

481
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,208
How could she have known Ji Sooheon
was our suspect?

482
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,168
And how could she have known

483
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,837
that the backpack
was the major piece of evidence?

484
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,925
Most importantly, how could she have known
the police were on their way?

485
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,803
How could she have opened
Ji Sooheon's locker?

486
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,970
I...

487
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,098
I also think that doesn't add up.

488
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,266
But that backpack seems weird.

489
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,268
There's something weird about it.
Especially at night.

490
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,881
The person you dialed cannot be reached.

Why is Chanmi here?

499
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,492
Osung, I'm sorry.

500
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,369
I know this has been a burden for you.

501
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,165
Not at all, ma'am.
Our teacher and I were just concerned.

502
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,710
Is Jaebum not answering your calls either?

503
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,879
No.

504
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,964
I think of you as my second son.

505
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:02,428
That's why I trust you and why I'm asking
for your help with this.

506
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,138
Oh, it's my pleasure, ma'am.

507
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,432
I also think of Jaebum
as a brother of mine.

508
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,435
Thank you.

509
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,192
It seems his memories
are slowly coming back to him.

510
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,443
Right.

511
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,446
The last time,
he called me from the stables at night.

512
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,907
He was asking me where he was
and he told me he was scared.

513
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,909
I wonder if that's when it started.

514
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,452
What did he tell you?

515
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,913
He didn't say anything in particular.

516
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:33,417
But after that call, I installed
a tracking app on his cell phone.

517
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,336
That's what he asked me to do.

518
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,504
Because he said himself
that he wasn't sure

519
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,297
-what kind of places he might go to.
-Then...

520
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,217
Could you check where Jaebum is right now?

Yeah, sure. What's up?

524
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,658
You weren't at school.

525
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,660
I came out for a walk
because I was feeling stuffy.

526
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,662
Where should I meet you?

527
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,792
How about the intersection
by Lucky Mall?

528
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,085
Okay.

Hey, isn't that man the detective?

531
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,333
Tae Soyeon, do you recognize me?

532
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,002
I'm from the Special Victims Unit
at Yongtan Police Station.

533
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,962
Yes, I do.

534
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,339
How can I help you?

535
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,299
When we looked up your phone record,

536
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,425
we found that you were the one

537
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,636
who called
and messaged Ji Sooheon the most.

538
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,471
And what's wrong with that?

539
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,597
Ji Sooheon.

540
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,183
Do you know where he is right now?

541
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,143
How would I know that?

542
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,645
Do you have a warrant, sir?

543
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,146
You can ask simple questions
without a warrant.

544
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,273
So I guess we're not obligated
to answer simple questions, right?

545
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,529
Can you relay this message
to Ji Sooheon for me?

546
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,572
Hiding isn't always the best option.

547
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,034
If he helps us with the investigation,
his compliance will be taken into account.

548
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,536
So tell him to come out of hiding.

549
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,246
Investigation? Take that into account?

550
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,373
What is he talking about?

551
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,374
What's going on?

552
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,500
Mr. detective.

553
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,628
I have no idea
what Sooheon's being investigated for.

554
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,172
So please don't come at me
if you don't have a warrant.

555
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,591
Who do you think you are?
Showing up out of nowhere?

556
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,843
Come on, let's go.

557
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,304
-What was that all about?
-I don't know.

558
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,681
-What is this about?
-What? I don't know...

559
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,890
What?

560
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,935
-Hurry up.
-I'm hungry too.

561
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,774
What? Are you saying Ji Sooheon
was the hero that beat up Sa Junggyeong?

562
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,445
Wow, that's crazy awesome!

563
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
Ji Sooheon, seriously.

564
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,157
Oh, and the juvenile delinquent
from your middle school.

565
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,867
The one we met at the OBGYN clinic.

566
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,201
That bastard...

567
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,121
What's wrong with him?

568
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,998
Sooheon also beat up
that juvenile delinquent.

569
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
That's amazing.

570
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,376
He really is a true hero, isn't he?

571
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,045
Wow, seriously.

572
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,339
-This is crazy.
-The juvenile delinquent...

573
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,383
is dead.

574
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,927
What?

575
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,846
Dead?

576
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,032
Ajung.

577
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
I'm really sorry to ask you
to do this, but...

578
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,204
if a detective asks you
about the juvenile delinquent,

579
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,413
just say you don't know him.

580
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,332
Are you saying the police
will come after me too?

581
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,001
The detective saw your face
just a few minutes ago.

582
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,462
When he plays
the surveillance footage at the clinic,

583
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,671
he's going to recognize

584
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
your face.

585
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,384
I can just say I don't know him,
and that'll be it.

586
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,136
But what's Sooheon going to do?

587
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,804
Sooheon didn't kill him.

588
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,140
Of course not.

589
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,725
He's not that type of person.

590
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,603

Are you here to see Ji Sooheon?

Yeah, the homeroom teacher told me

Isn't this place Ji Sooheon's?

Is she living with Ji Sooheon?

615

No, it doesn't seem like
they're living together.

616
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,285
Is Ji Sooheon inside?

No, he's not.

618
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
Then what were you doing inside?

00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,623
I thought this was Ji Sooheon's place.

620
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,335
So Ok Chanmi is living here, right?

621

I think so.

00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,895
Hey, Osung, what's going on?

640
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,022
Didn't you tell me
you'd take care of Chanmi

641
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,232
in a way that would be satisfying to me?

642
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,900
What did she do to you this time?

643
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,152
Are you blind?

644
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,695
Ok Chanmi has seduced Ji Sooheon

645
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,864
and they're living together
on his rooftop.

646
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:46,034
Wow, this bitch is so much
more than I'd expected.

647
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,999
What? Isn't this Ok Chanmi's scooter?

648
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,088
What?

649
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,858
CALL_RECORDING_OK_CHANKYU

650
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,985
Hello?

651
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,198
Hello?

652
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,617
Who are you?

653
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,661
Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?

654
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,830
Hello? Hell...

655
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,227
Sooheon.

656
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,356
TROPICAL LAND

657
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,362
I think you'll be able to leave tomorrow.

658
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,489
Thank you.

659
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,491
Your test results don't indicate
that you've gotten any better,

660
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,992
but you haven't gotten worse either.

661
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,870
All we can do is leave it in God's hands.

662
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,622
Yes, sir.

663
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,500
That's what you told me last time, too.

664
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,503
Don't worry about the hospital bill.
You need to come to the hospital.

665
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,089
There are lots of good people
in this world.

666
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,674
There are a lot of organizations
that make charitable donations.

667
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,384
I'll help you secure a donation
for your bills.

668
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,802
Thank you, sir.

669
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,179
Also...

670
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,722
Here.

671
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,184
No matter what it is,
give me a call on my cell phone.

672
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,686
I'd be happy to hear from you.

673
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,147
WOOSEONG HOSPITAL
JEON INSEON NEUROSURGEON

674
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,440
Okay.

675
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,401
How is that wound on your shoulder?

676
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,487
It's much better now.

677
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,865
Why would you pick a fight on the street?

678
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,290
GOGO STADIUM

679
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,412
Oh, Oh! Get out of the way!
Get out of way! Uh, I'm sorry.

680
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,250
Huh? Uh.

681
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,925
Damn!

682
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,899
Oh my, what on earth happened?

683
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,492
Did you say the brake wasn't working?

684
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,953
Yes, sir. It didn't seem to work at all.

685
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,496
Did something break?

686
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,081
Chanmi.

687
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,458
This isn't broken.

688
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,710
It looks like
someone cut it intentionally.

689
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,045
What?

690
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,631
There's no way
the brake could've broken from wear.

691
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,549
This part here looks like an even cut.

692
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,426
Someone cut this with a knife.

693
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,680
Do you mean someone cut it on purpose?

694
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,641
Wow, this could have killed you.

695
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,559
This is outrageous!

696
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,481
Hey, Chanmi, might there be anyone
who'd try to hurt you?

697
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,245
Listen up, you murderer!

698
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,081
I'm doing just fine!

699
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,543
Keep on trying with your bullshit,
you crazy bastard!

700
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,337
You can't kill me. Ever!

701
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,131
I won't die.

702
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,217
Instead, I'll track you down.

703
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,594
She's really gone mad.

704
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,096
Are you afraid?

705
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,850
Come at me, come at me now.
You crazy piece of shit!

706
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,185
Stop hiding with your bullshit.
Come out, I said!

707
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,812
I'll make sure I kick your ass. Come out!

708
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,189
-Hey, stop it, I said. Stop! Shit!
-Why? Let me go!

709
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,051
You should see a doctor
about your knee and wrist pain.

710
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,637
You might have after-effects,
so make sure you go see a doctor.

711
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,097
I will. Thank you.

712
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,022
NURSE'S OFFICE

713
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,398
Are you okay?

714
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,608
Yeah, I'm fine.

715
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,651
Do you want us to take you
to the hospital?

716
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,737
No, I'll be fine.

717
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,406
I'm just going to head home
and get some rest.

718
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,033
Thanks.

719
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,370
KOREAN GEOSCIENCE OLYMPIAD
WRITING COMPETITION

720
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,960
Today's Chanmi's birthday.

721
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,046
What?

722
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,090
What do you mean?

723
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,800
I mean, how do you know that?

724
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,968
Oh, because Park Wonseok's birthday
reminder has been popping up

725
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,929
on my messaging app since 3 days ago.

726
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,223
Oh.

727
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,350
They were twins, right?

728
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,490
OK CHANMI

729
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,799
DOCTOR'S OFFICE 2

730
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,135
VACCINATION INFORMATION

731
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,387
Yes?

732
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,764
Hey, sweetie?

733
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,141
Oh, honey!

734
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,476
Didn't we say we were going to meet
at the main entrance?

735
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,395
Well, you know, it's been a while
since I've been in your office,

736
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,605
so I thought I'd pop in.

737
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,939
I thought you hated hospitals.

738
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,107
It's not that I wanted
to visit the hospital.

739
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,817
I just wanted to see the room
where you work.

740
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,988
Detectives and doctors have dull offices,
don't you think?

741
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,865
Um-hm. I guess we're pretty dull
as people too.

742
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,241
I can't argue with that.

743
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,242
Um...

744
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,285
So where are you going to take me
for lunch?

745
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,578
I'm not going to eat vegan food.

746
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,205
Okay. Right.

747
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,289
Please come in.

748
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,044
Oh, hey, Sooheon,
are you heading home now?

749
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,378
Yes, Doctor.

750
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,401
You've been in the hospital all this time?

751
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,654
Yes.

752
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,615
Why didn't you keep your phone on?
Your friends were worried about you.

753
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,826
I didn't want to tell them
I was in the hospital...

754
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,162
Ah.

755
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,540
Well, I guess I jumped to conclusions.

756
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,418
And it goes without saying

757
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,129
that I won't tell anyone
about your illness.

758
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,009
If you're uncomfortable
talking about this,

759
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,469
of course you're free to leave.

760
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,722
No, it's fine.

761
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,021
I'm sure we'll run into each other again,

762
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:39,025
but I'll pretend I never saw you
at the hospital.

763
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,654
You're a detective.
You need to do your job.

764
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,658
Just like the doctor did his job
as a doctor.

765
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,955
This is kind of an odd thing
for me to say,

766
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,625
but, Sooheon, you're very mature.

767
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,713
I know it's also an odd thing
for me to say,

768
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,840
but, Detective,

769
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,551
I think you've married a great person.

770
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,304
My husband?

771
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,722
Yes.

772
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,101
I think Dr. Jeon is a really nice person.

773
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:21,192
I never tell my husband
about my investigations.

774
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,489
So don't be stressed
about meeting my husband at the hospital.

775
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,824
Just focus on your treatment.

776
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,409
Yes.

777
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,077
Thank you.

778
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:38,001
But I guess I don't have to say
I'm innocent while I'm here, do I?

779
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,796
No, that's not something
we need to talk about right now.

780
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,759
If it's okay with you,
I'll be heading out now.

781
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,429
As far as I know,
we never met at the hospital.

782
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,245
THE LIFE AHEAD
LA VIE DEVANT SOI

783
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,874
Where did the photo go?

784
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,503
I put it in this book.

785
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,843
I guess the repair man is here
to replace the glass.

786
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,638
Yes, I'll be right there!

787
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,537
What happened to the door?
And to your forehead?

788
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,793
You're alive?

789
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,837
What happened to you?

790
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,381
What happened?

791
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,966
I fell while riding my scooter.

792
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,260
The glass was broken
because someone broke in.

793
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,345
You should've been more careful.

794
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,056
Was something stolen?

795
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,224
Nothing.

796
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,309
There's nothing worth taking.

797
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,853
I guess it's all cool then.

798
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,690
-What happened to you?
-Me? I'm a suspect.

799
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,233
That's why I went silent.
To go into hiding.

00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,527
And you had your cell phone turned off
because you were hiding?

801
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,863
Right.

802
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,865
I just turned my cell phone on
and saw that you called.

803
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,241
Twenty-nine times.

804
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,034
Yeah.

805
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,079
Twenty-nine missed calls.

806
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,081
So now, do you understand how upset I was?

807
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,709
Sorry.

808
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,504
Well, it's not something
you need to apologize for.

809
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,049
I also dealt with a lot of stress

810
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,593
while I was alone
with my phone turned off.

811
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,970
I'm sure you were.

812
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,850
Hey, why don't we go
and relieve some stress together today?

813
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,188
That's not a bad idea.

814
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,772
Cool.

815
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,733
-You're a pretty good singer.
-I thought you were way better.

816
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,917
♪ Congratulations, congratulations ♪

817
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,962
♪ We congratulate you on your birthday ♪

818
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,133
What are you waiting for?
The candles are melting.

819
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,134
Ah, okay.

820
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,641
Hey, how did you know
to put all of this together?

821
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,850
How did you know it was my birthday?

822
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,311
I knew Wonseok's birthday,

823
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,022
So I and Soyeon planned to throw you
a birthday party and put it all together.

824
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,442
Sooheon turned on his cell phone
just in time.

825
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,029
Well since he had tons of missed calls,
I'm assuming he felt guilty and called me?

826
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:57,367
I also happened to call him a lot,
and he called me back too.

827
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,619
Why don't we create a club?
A missed calls club?

828
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,496
Cool! I'm all for it.

829
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,705
-Sounds good, yeah?
-Yes.

830
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,166
"Missed Calls" sounds cool.

831
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,876
If it's a missed calls club,

832
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,087
would anyone even show up
when we called them up?

833
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,296
I'll show up.

834
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,799
What?

835
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,888
You're cute, Soyeon.

836
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,100
Yes, ma'am.

837
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,186
I followed the map you sent me.

838
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,147
It seems like Jaebum is here.

839
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,024
Yes.

840
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,195
I'll persuade him to come back home today.

841
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,239
Don't worry too much.

842
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,116
Yes.

843
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,837
HIGH TEEN KARAOKE

844
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,507
Huh.

845
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,925
This guy's getting weird.

846
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,468
Why is he at a karaoke?

847
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,889
Huh?

848
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,268
Isn't that Ok Chanmi?

849
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,896
-It's all over my face!
-Uh, you...

850
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,732
Hey, Chanmi doesn't know about this,
does she?

851
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,816
Huh?

852
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,779
Here.

853
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,158
HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY

854
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,576
Gi Osung?

855
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,494
Osung.

856
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,164
-Are you here for me?
-Yeah.

857
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,957
Are you guys celebrating
Ok Chanmi's birthday here?

858
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,542
Yeah, I guess you must have run into her.

859
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,585
I saw that she was on her way
to the bathroom

860
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,794
with a bunch of cream on her face.

861
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,381
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

862
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,591
Yeah, come join us.

863
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,593
It's fine, I wasn't invited anyway.

864
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,262
Jaebum, I'll be waiting for you
in the café out front.

865
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,722
Okay, then.

866
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,693
Bye.

867
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,111
See you.
