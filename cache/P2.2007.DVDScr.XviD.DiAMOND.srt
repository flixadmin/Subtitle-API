1
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,466
Yes Sir, I redrafted the contracts
with the new stipulations.

2
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,039
- Where are they?
- I'll fax them right the way.

3
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,072
Did you make the changes that I ask?

4
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,750
Yea, I included the 4% increase
in the extra 10 million.

5
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,351
No, no, it's 4% of one million.

6
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,353
No, no that's not what I was told.

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,150
- Who told you to do this?
- Their lawyers...

8
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,286
Those idiots, you have to change it,
it's a total lack of communication.

9
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,295
No, no it's okay, I have
everything right here.

10
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,160
Ok, that's what I want you to do.

11
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,394
- Okay, can you just hang on for a second.
- All right.

12
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,162
Thank you... Hi Jody.

13
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,408

see you in his office.

14
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,176

15
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,846
You know what, it's okay, I have
a few more things to get done yet.

16
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,515
- You should go home.
- Are you sure?

17
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,741
Yea, it's late, I don't

Still working on the contract?

24
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,046

Look, I feel terrible
about what happend...

It's all right, it's fine.

28
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,260
Just let's not worry about it, okay.

29
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,091
No... it's not okay.

30
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,859
I feel like a real jerk.

31

And we had a baby last year...
and it's been just a hard year.

33
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,712
I'm sure it has.

I'm just realy realy sorry, okay..

44
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,388

sister's house in Jersey.

67
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,931
New Jersey? I thought of you

68
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,934
Yea, Upper East Side of Main, actualy.

69
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,340

- A farm?

70
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,041
Now I'm having trouble believe'ing that.

71
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,337
Don't let the fancy clothes deceive you,
I'm a farm girl realy, I grew up on a farm.

72
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,348

80
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,308
You got to be kidding me.

81
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,951
Oh, God... not now.

82
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,467

83
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,212

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,429
Ah... look, can you onlock

89
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,431

90
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,567

- Ok.
- What happend to your car?

94
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,278
- I have no idea.
- You know, you probably left the lights on.

95
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,175
No, I don't think so, I'm usualy
pretty good about that kind of thing.

96
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,452
People do it all the time, they
drive down here in the dark...

97
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,385
you know, it happends.

98
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,853
Here they are.

99
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,056
Great.

100
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,660
You know actualy I just thought,
I have a charger in the back,

101
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,559
So if It is your battery
probably, you can use that.

102
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:39,566
Oh, thank you, but I realy should
get a cab, I'm so late already.

103
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,899
No, i don't know about getting
a cab it's Christmas eve.

104
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,175
So, it's up to you what ever you want.

105
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,215
- How long will it take?
- Just a few minutes, give me one second.

106
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,627
So, where's your car?

107
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,659
Over there.

108
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,937
Working late hugh...
Well, I know how you feel.

109
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,770
These are pretty reliable
cars for the most part.

110
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,578
They're supose to be.

111
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,549
Right, positive.

112
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,177
Negative.

113
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,686
All right, try it, turn it over.

114
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,487
That's strange.

115
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,493
Okay, hang on, can you
turn your headlights on?

116
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,369
Okay, try with the key again.

117
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,999
Shit.

118
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,971
All right, turn the head lights off.

119
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,072
You know what, that's it, I...

120
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,078
You've been a great help, but I give up.

121
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,719
I'm sorry about that, I
don't know what happend.

122
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,055
I thought I could do something about it.

123
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,020
That's okay, you've been great, can
you just get me the elevator now.

124
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,658
I was just trying to help.

125
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,124
I know, and I appreciate it, thank you.

126

You can handle this by yourself?

137
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,116
You sure you don't want
me to call you a cab?

138
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,915
Yea, I got the number.

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,825
I got a cab waiting for me outside,
can you open the front gate, please.

157
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,227
Hello?

158
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,568
No, no, no, no, no, wait please.

159
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,169
Damn, don't leave me here.

160
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,648
No service.

161
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,511
Wake up, damn it, the cab just left.

162
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,407
Hey, I am still in here, wait.

163
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,657

164
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,609
Hello?

165
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,252
Ok, don't be gettin' paranoid.

166
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,122
I got to get the feel of this.

167
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,029
Hello?

168
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,029
Oh... oh... fuck...

169
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,371
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas,
you've been a good little girl.

170
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,580
Ok, you're all right, right, okay.

171
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,419
Ok. you're okay? take it easy,

172
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,080
Okay.

173
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,526
What happend to me? What time is it?

174
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,021
You just fell, you'll be all right.

175
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,932
I don't feel well,
I'm gettin' realy sick.

176
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,130
Hold on, I'll get you
some water, all right.

177
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
You got to be careful, okay.

178
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,043
or you gonna hurt yourself.

179
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,677
Just try to stay calm.

180
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,347
Ok.

181
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,546
Oh, ok, here.

182
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,760
Ok, I will help you up, ok then.

183
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,200
Here we go, ok.

184
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,666
All right now... ok,

185
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,804
Just try to relaxe and
I will clean this up.

186
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,900
Ok.

187
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,957
All right... I'll be right back.

188
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,541
Are you hungry?

189
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,045
I... have turkey, mashed potatoes...

190
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,546
a little clam bake, and 
I even have some... corn bread.

191
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,655
Oh, I'm sorry about this.

192
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,465
I was just kidding... 
I didn't mean to scare you.

193
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,995
good it's still warm.

194
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,911
If not, I have a microwave so...

195
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,243
Are you feeling any better?

196
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,249
What happend to my clothes?

197
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,451
Like I said, you fell and
your clothes got dirty, so...

198
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,223
Maybe... maybe you like some wine...

199
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,028
to... relax a little bid.

200
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,429
Look, I don't know what you're doing,
but you better just fucking untie me.

201
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,551
This is a California wine...

202
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:43,047
It's from Sanoma county, that's where
I'm from, it's beautyful up there.

203
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,157
Where're you from?

204
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,257
What'd you want?

205
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,864
I wanna know where you from?

206
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,199
I'm from Wheatfield.

207
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,740
Wheatfield... where is that?

208
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,001
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

209
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,509
I just wanna know everything.

210
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,713
I want you to relax.

211
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,929
Cheers.

212
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,364
Ok, I... I'll make a toast.

213
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:39,242
Here is to good friends,
and home towns and...

214
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,939
Wheatfield, where...
where-ever that is.

215
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,246
- Ahh... listen...
- Tom.

216
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,487
Tom... I have some place to be.

217
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,885
You know I'm starting on my vacation.

218
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,059
Yea, I know.

219
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:04,302
And way to many, you don't have time for yourself,
you don't need to be everyones backin call.

220
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,307
Maybe we just... can
do this next year?

221
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,707
I prepared everything, it's all here

222
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,412
I know... and it looks realy good.

223
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,415
Yea, great.

224
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,022
Well let's eat, I'm... starving.

225
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,318
Tom this is realy sweet, but...

226
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,326
But you know, my whole family is
excpecting me, and I've got plans...

227
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,259
I guess some plans
are made to be broken.

228
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,434
You wanna say grace, or should I?

229
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,335
Hell, let's forget it.

230
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,444
I'm not to religious anyway.

231
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,143
Bon Appetite.

232
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,090
What'd you like to do?

233
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,930
You know, after work and
stuff... there's hobbies,

234
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,595
I know it's a mundane question, I guess people
ask them to get to know each other, right?

235
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,502
I read... right now
I'm reading Hemingway.

236
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,008
The Sun Also Rises.

237
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,043
You realy should eat this, 
it's gonna get cold.

238
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,618
So anyway, in this book, this
guy loves this girl so much...

239
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:35,216
That he's willing to forgive...
everything that she does.

240
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,054
Even her infidelities.

241
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,827
That's a pretty intense story, but...
that's what love supose to be, right?

242
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,143
My boyfriend's gonna get worried,
he's gonna come looking for me...

243
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,684
If I don't show up, he's gonna come
looking for me, he knows where I work.

244
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,298
How long you've guys been
dating... hanging out?

245
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,300
- 2 years.
- 2 years?

246
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,508
- Do you guys live together?
- That's none of your fucking buisness.

247
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,444
That's not a very nice way to talk.

248
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,013
Yea, we do live together, ok.

249
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,617
2 years...

250
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,321
that's more then a
boyfriend, that's a...

251
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,562
...sounds more like wedding bells.

252
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,563
- You guys got any plans?
- Yes.

253
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,033
What does... what's your fiance do?

254
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,667
He's a journalist.

255
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,467
Journalist? See, I knew 
he had to be smart.

256
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,010
- What kind of journalist?
- Sports.

257
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,703
Sports... what paper?

258
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,980
- The Post.
- The Post? I read the post.

259
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,984
- What's his name?
- Mark Clayton.

260
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,882
Clayton? Clayton? I
don't remember that name.

261
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,483
Well... I have one right here.

262
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,628
It's online, it's the Post online.

263
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:32,536
You know what... it is amaizing, that
you're able to keep a relationship...

264
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,608
...with all the hours that you work!

265
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,112
He must get realy lonely, when
you have to work late, right?

266
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,920
Do you love him? 
Does he love you?

267
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,866
I'm only asking because... I'm
worried how quick he's gonna get here.

268
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,865
I'm sure he's already on his way.

269
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,967
Right...

270
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,972
he's probably on the
highway as we speak.

271
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,273
- What kind of car does he drive?
- I don't...

272
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,677
You don't know... you don't know
what kind of car your fiance drives?

273
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,477
- A Toyota, I think...
- Toyota?

274
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,285
That's a fast car, he can be here
a lot sooner then I was thinking.

275
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,823
He'll be coming down this
ramp right now as we speak

276
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,042
You know, you haven't been,
very talketive since we've met.

277
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,813
But now...

278
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,478
...you'll tell me all
about'm... your boyfriend.

279
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,111
No sorry your fiance.

280
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,347
So either we become best
friends over dinner...

281
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,455
...or you're lying to me?

282
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,825
Let me guess... you're lying to me.

283
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,934
You don't you really
have a boyfriend, do you?

284
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,940
But you want one,

285
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,674
...you want somebody
that cares about you...

286
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,641
...who worries about you.

287
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,578
Please, don't.

288
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,354
You've got a... you got a great family,

289
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,549
You know you got... Lorraine.

290
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,360
Little Jimmy, Rose, and they love you.

291
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,269
They probably are worried about you.

292
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,469
Maybe we should give them a call.

293
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,174
Yea... tell them you're okay.

294
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,579
What'd you think?

295
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,424
What should we say?

296
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,661
I know... I know, we should
say you made other plans.

297
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,835
No, you already said that one.

298
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:20,673
You know what, you should think
of something, you're a good liar.

299
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,177
Go ahead... go!

300
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,051
No.

301
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,061
Hello, hello?

302
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,601
Hey Rosie, can you get
your mommy on phone.

303
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,567
Who's calling please?

304
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,979
It's auntie Angi.

305
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:59,074
- Mommy it's aunt Angi.
- Give me a second, okay.

306
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,817
Hey, where are you? Angela?

307
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,018
I not feeling well.

308
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,620
What'd you mean? We're
all waiting for you.

309
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,151
- She says, she doesn't feel well.
- She said that the last time.

310
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,227
Can I speak with my sister, please?

311
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,128
So where are you Angi?

312
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,034
Angela?

313
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,336
At home, I went home.

314
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,642
- What's wrong? where is she?
- I realy don't understand.

315
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,744
Last time I talked to you,
you said you were on your way.

316
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,741
What about the costum?

317
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,975
What's the big deal, you should 
know your sister by now.

318
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,153
Angela, you know, you should try to
put your family ahead of yourself.

319
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,585
Give me the phone.

320
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,290
Angi what's wrong?

321
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,958
Hello? I can't hear her? Hello!

322
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,994
Sweety, can you hear me?

323
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,894
Hi mom, I'm here.

324
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,898
Honey, what happend? Where are you?

325
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:58,005
I don't know, I think I got the flue

326
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,304
You sound terrible, are
you sure you're okay?

327
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,341
- Honey.
- Yes.

328
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,251
I just need some rest.

329
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,257
Ok, well rest up and hopefully you
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

330
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,317
And sweety don't worry
about the costum, ok?

331
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,030
Merry Christmas, Ángel, I love you.

332
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,933
I love you too, mom.

333
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,446
That's the best Christmas
present anyone has ever given me.

334
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,949
Thank you.

335
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,482
And now I have a present for you.

Go ahead, open it.

337
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,150
Aren't you even curios?

338
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,956
Come on, open it.

339
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,326
Yea, yea, yea.

340
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,230
I'll bet you're curios now, yea?

341
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,840
Ok, enough torture.

342
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,652
Watch, okay.

343
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,657
Why are you showing this to me?

344
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,360
Wait...

345
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,823
You fuckin' male asshole.

346
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,762
Sorry you had to see that.

347
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,928
You wanna go for a stroll?

348
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:50,439
These guys... they always
do... whatever they want.

349
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,653
Here we go.

350
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,593
Stay... stay down, stay.

351
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,899
Hold still...

352
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,899
Why did you do that?

353
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,507
Rocky, shut the fuck up...

354
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,911
- Let me to help you up.

355
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,919
Don't be silly, I'm not
gonna hurt you, all right?

356
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,151
You're hurting my arm.

357
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,327
Because you wont let me help.

358
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,965
- Come on.
- Where we're going?

359
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,632

360
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,463

361
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,084
Nobody behind us, yea.

362
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,093
Here we go.

363
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,910
Oh, oh... I think I drank to much wine.

364
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,311
I realy shouldn't be driving.

365
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,709
I'm just kiddin'.

366
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,922
I've seen you drive
out here so many times.

367
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,254
It's strange actualy to
be in the car with you.

368
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,067
In fact it's nice.

369
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,736
I thought you said we where taking a drive.

370
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,232
We are.

371
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,965
Then why are we going down, Tom?

372
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,776
It's freezing out there.

373
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,777
Besides... this is gonna be much better.

374
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,890
Why are we down here, Tom?

375
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:20,890
Tom?

376
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,214
Oh my God.

377
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,255
What're we gonna do... what is this?

378
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,918
This is my present to you.

379
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,799
Takes this and show him.

380
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,672
Show him what?

381
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,674
Show him you're not a slut.

382
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,881
Take this and teach him, he can't
be touching every woman he wants.

383
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,111
Are you talking about what
happend in the elevator?

384
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,389
Oh, Tom... no, no, no, you don't
understand, that was a mistake.

385
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,424
That was a stupid mistake.

386
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,889
What?

387
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,188
He try'd to rape you.

388
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,295
No, he just got a litle out'o hand at 
this party,Tom.

389
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,995
He was hardly trying to rape me, look...

390
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,138
he was drunk, he apoligized.

391
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,634
Ohh... he apoligized, ohhh...

392
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,401
You think that you're the
first one he did this to?

393
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,212
I've seen him trying to touch
every women in this building.

394
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,940
He is a pervert, he is a degenerate.

395
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,617
No, he's not.

396
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,017
He's a good man, Tom... he's
a good man, just look at him,

397
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,723
He has a family, and he has a wife,

398
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,222
Tom please. Tom...

399
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,052
Stop, don't keep calling
out my name, all right.

400
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,822
I know what you're tryin' to do.

401
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,857
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victum.

402
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,932
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you.

403
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,962
All right? Stop calling out my name.

404
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,537
All right... enough with this, 
Tom, Tom, Tom.

405
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,040
What did I say... look,

406
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,750
I know you're a person...
I know you're a person, okay.

407
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,649
I'm a person too.

408
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,985
I know you have feelings.

409
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,662
I have feelings too.

410
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,690
I care about your feelings.

411
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,095
He's the one you should be scared of.

412
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,999
He's the one who has no feelings.

413
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,276
Look... you wanna help him.

414
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,776
Take this and teach him a lesson.

415
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,587
I told you... he apoligized.

416
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,252
He apoligizes and
then he'll do it again.

417
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,758
And he'll apologizes again.

418
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,327
You better put a stop to this,
before he's having his way with you.

419
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,857
Tom...

420
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,634
Please believe me, it was
just a misunderstanding, Tom

421
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,964
Stop calling out my name, I told you.

422
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,539
- Didn't I?
- Yes, yes, yes.

423
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,779
You're scaring me.

424
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,141
Jesús, when will you understand?

425
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,452
I'm here to help you.

426
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,187
I'm not gonna hurt you.

427
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,366
Ok.

428
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,467
I'll do it.

429
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,006
You untie me and I'll do it.

430
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,513
No... no, no, no...

431
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,316
You're a good person.

432
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,126
You're a good person too.

433
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,862
I should never have ask
you to do this, I'm sorry.

434
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,131
No, it's okay... it's ok,

435
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,828
Because I want to...

436
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,363
You just have to untie me, and i'll do it.

437
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,948
No, no, no, it's my job... it's my job.

438
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,483
No, Tom listen to me,
it's not... it's not.

439
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,054
Please, don't do anything.

440
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,488
Don't try to run away, ok?

441
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,692
Can I trust you?

442
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,491
Can I trust you?

443
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,599
You can trust me.

444
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,165
Don't do it...

445
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,172
don't...

446
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,010
So you like to touch girls, do you?

447
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,919
No, no, no?

448
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,316
Look at her, I said look at her.

449
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,327
Does she look happy to you?

450
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,761
Yea, yea, you messed
with the wrong girl, ha...

451
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,973
What makes you think, you deserve her?

452
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,837
What gives you the right?

453
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,641
You're something else, you know that.

454
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:41,944
You pretensges ivy leauge, piece of shit.

455
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:46,452
You don't own the world,
and everyone in it.

456
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,157
That's what a guy like you thinks only... 
puts his hands...

457
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,452
...all over a girl, who
obviously is not interested?

458
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,662
Who is obviously not a slut.

459
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,558
That's what you do think they are, right?

460
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,937
Yea... I can't hear you.

461
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,401
What'd you say? Hey... what... what? 
Hey can you speak up...

462
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,902
Because you can't talk your way out 
of this one can you?

463
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,440
Why I even wasting my time with you?

464
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,314
No...

465
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,612
Why Angela, he deserves it?

466
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,719
He don't have this coming, please...

466
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:34,719
Nooo...

467
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,040
No Tom... stop it.

468
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,395
Very Merry Christmas, asshole.

469
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,613
Look, he wont be bothering you again.

470
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,519
Where're we going? We
can't just leave him there.

471
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,021
No we can't.

472
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,849
Why are you defending him?

473
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,621
No I'm not.

474
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,262
You like it, you like to be touched?

475
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,128
You like it when he touches
you in the parking garage?

476
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,322
You wanna get laid there?

477
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,933
You know that's not true.

478
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,765
So what, what is it? is it a career thing?

479
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,737
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

480
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,870
Leave me alone.

481
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,344
You're right, You're right, I'm sorry.

482
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,046
We shouldn't leave him here.

483
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,395
What you're doing?

484
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:09,996
We're just gonna take him for a little drive.

485
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,730

00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,527

Do you have somebody coming over

636
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,954
Me? No, no, the company would fire me 
if they find anyone down here tonight.

637
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,084
Especially at this hour.
