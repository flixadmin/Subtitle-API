in Washington.

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,099
Folks are wondering
if we're gonna win this thing.

00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,895

of the Appropriations Committee,

Now, everyone's proud of the work
you guys did to bring down Escobar.

46
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,490
And it's particularly an honour
to meet you, Agent Peña.

47
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,745
But cocaine continues to flow north,
and the American people wonder

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,082
if the Colombians share our enthusiasm
to take this threat head-on.

49
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:13,003
Our colleague, Senator Helms, put
forward some tough language on them.

50
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,840
But we wanted to come down here
and get the real from you all.

51
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,634
See first-hand what's at stake.

See how and... if we can give you
all the support you need.

Let's extend the senators
every courtesy while they're here.

Their mission is a priority.

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,049
'a money launderer became
more than just a connection

157
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,885
'to the financial institutions
that washed their cash.

158
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,014
'For all intents and purposes,
he is their money.

159
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,852
'Jurado was the perfect bridge between
the narcos and the world of high finance.

160
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,188
'He spoke five languages
and travelled on multiple passports.

161
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,734
'He married an American girl he met
while at business school in the States,

162
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,029
'took her down south,
and got her in on his action.

163
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,241
'An American passport was solid gold
in any Caribbean bank.

164
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,370
'Jurado was smooth.
But now, we knew his name.'

165
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,581
These are cash transfers.

166
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,293
The accounts are controlled
by a man named Franklin Jurado.

167
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,048
- You know him?
- Of him.

168
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,468
He served
as director at Interamericas.

169
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,887
- The Rodríguez brothers' bank.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,182
They later gave him
a more important job.

171
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,517
Do you have an address for Jurado?

172
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,436
I can get it for you.

173
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,733
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

174
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,486
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

175
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

176
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,661
Do they know what you're doing?

177
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,372
No comment.

178
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,541
♪ Dance with me

179
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,253
♪ In my world of fantasy

180
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,507
♪ Won't you dance with me?

181
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,761
♪ Ritual fertility... ♪

182
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,815
I was thinking...

183
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,735
...maybe I could come with you.

184
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,990
Come on, this could be our last chance
to travel like we used to.

185
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,244
- Remember that place in Milan?
- With the leaking roof?

186
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,330
On your birthday.
And that terrible risotto.

187
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,958
That balcony.

188
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,380
The brothers are pushing now, baby.
They are opening more accounts.

189
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,841
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

190
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,849
How high are you right now?

191
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, fuck you!

192
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,812
Give me your passport.

193
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,566
I can't stay in this apartment anymore,
Franklin.

194
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,861
I can't watch another movie
with subtitles by myself.

195
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,655
I don't want to listen to the cartel wives
talk about their husbands like...

196
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,616
- With an English degree from Harvard...
- Please don't tell me I can teach.

197
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,162
Then what did you want me to say?
Fuck...

198
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,874
We'll do this another time.

199
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,005
The dining room is over here.

200
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,883
You have a room over here.

201
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,093
You have another one over here.

202
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,096
And here, you have the living room.

203
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
The dimmer is over here.

204
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,443
And you can adjust the light.

205
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,489
Well... you get the idea.

206
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:05,202
- No. I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

207
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,120
Does this seem normal to you?

208
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,705
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

209
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,666
you were uncertain about returning
to the North Valley.

210
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,378
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

211
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,799
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

212
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,927
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

213
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,139
We have that dinner tonight.

214
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
With your friends?

215
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,977
With the investors.

216
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,689
They're not going to like
the six-month delay.

217
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,528
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodríguez brothers by name.

218
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,117
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

219
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,043
I know you did it for your family.

220
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,004
But if these people like everything
they hear tonight,

221
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,007
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

222
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,886
- Ready!
- Good.

223
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,306
A choir!

224
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,016
All right, say goodbye to Dad.
We're leaving.

225
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,852
- Bye.
- Bye.

226
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,563
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

227
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,315
Will you make it on time?

228
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,526
If you're wearing the dress
with the flowers, yes.

229
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,116
Let's go, girls.

230
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,411
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

231
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,331
Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

232
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,128
I need you to pre-sweep
each and every location on this schedule.

233
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,299
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

234
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:46,678
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

235
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,016
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

236
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,560
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

237
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,648
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

238
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,444
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

239
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,905
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

240
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,869
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

241
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,706
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,625
That's all, gentlemen.

243
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,336
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

244
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,635
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

245
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,096
Of course.
Do you want to practise your English?

246
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,724
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

247
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,101
Can you pick him up from the airport?

248
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,730
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

249
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,359
The second team's
never as good as the first.

250
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,832
Got a look at the directory.
That company moved out three months ago.

251
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,710
If they were ever there at all.

252
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,556
Quiet part of the city here.

253
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:18,478
- Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?
- Nobody talks.

254
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,023
All the multinationals
used to have offices here in Cali.

255
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,441
"Used to"?

256
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,237
Pulled out because of the city's ties
to the narcotics trade.

257
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,241
The Rodríguez brothers
are the only game in town now.

258
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,787
Fucking drug dealers
pretending to be stockbrokers.

259
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,375
Motherfuckers ruined this city.

260
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,672
Where are we headed next?

261
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,591
Please.

262
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,304
This way, Mr. Starkman.

263
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,100
How the hell are you supposed
to fly international if you can't smoke?

264
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,060
I guess you can always quit.

265
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,481
And let United Airlines
tell me how to live?

266
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,571
Remind me again... Kansas City?

267
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,741
- Leavenworth.
- What the fuck for?

268
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,452
My father was in the army.
There's a base there.

269
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:20,373
They sent him to train.
I was like... seven years old.

270
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,334
What? It's America.

271
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,378
That's for sure.

272
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,881
So am I meeting the brothers
at the hotel?

273
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:28,923
Yes.

274
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,677
Serious stones on these guys.

275
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,347
Retiring,
like they run Lehman Brothers.

276
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,059
It's a good break for you, though.

277
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,770
You'll get immunity
when the surrender goes through.

278
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,398
I don't sell cocaine.
I don't shoot anyone.

279
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,694
You're a member of the Cali cartel.
You ever hear of conspiracy,<i>amigo?</i>

280
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,824
Relax, I got this. Look, they're lucky
to have us both, Jorge.

281
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,619
You can't put a price on freedom.

282
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,126
Though Lord knows I try.

283
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,342
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

284
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,968
Of course.

285
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,389
Currency aside, we aren't in
the habit of paying for things in advance.

286
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,476
What guarantee do we have that
you will provide what you promise?

287
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,061
Forgive my brother.

288
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,564
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

289
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,651
This afternoon, our associate,
Mr. Pallomari,

290
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,071
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

291
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,615
Very well.

292
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,869
The contribution should be divided
among seven men.

293
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,246
Their names are on the list.

294
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,919
All right, very well. Going forward,

295
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals
with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

296
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,384
As you wish.

297
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,804
Have a great day, gentlemen.

298
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,023
Well, our surrender has been bought.
Now it must be paid for.

299
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,695
And they say we're the criminals.

300
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,573
Sons of bitches.

301
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,994
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

302
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,288
Gentlemen, I will prepare
these payments myself,

303
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,123
as soon as I'm back in the office.

304
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,710
And I'll make sure
that all of this is in order.

305
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,880
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

306
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,009
If you ever make it to Miami
and you need a lawyer...

307
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,345
...hit me up.

308
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,723
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you, Mr. Starkman.

309
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,850
Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.

310
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,438
- Mr. Starkman. Welcome to Cali.
- Yeah.

311
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,733
The Rodríguez brothers
are pleased to welcome you.

312
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,320
No offence, but remind me again
what you do?

313
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,698
I'm the chief accountant
to the Rodríguez brothers.

314
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,994
What happened to the other guy?
The good-looking one? Pacho?

315
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,454
Mr. Herrera?

316
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,416
Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got
all the pussy in town on speed dial.

317
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah. Please, sir.

318
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,630
- 'Feistl.'
- How's it going?

319
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:18,551
Well, slow so far,
but Calderón seems like good police.

320
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,596
- Yeah? Good.
- 'That journalist come through?'

321
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,057
I'm on the money man right now.

322
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,267
- See where he takes me.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

323
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,144
Eyes open, Feistl.

324
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,730
- Everything by the book.
- 'Will do.'

325
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,234
- Keep me posted.
- Baby, wait...

326
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,865
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

327
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,523
The Arellano Felix brothers

328
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,733
are still wasting time with heroin.

329
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,362
Hey! What?
You're not going to say hello?

330
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,906
- Hello.
- Are you in a bad mood or what?

331
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,798
Amado... this is the life.

332
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,591
You guys helped me.

333
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,678
I moved the last 100 tons
in less than 50 days.

334
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,556
You tell me if we're a great team or not.

335
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,893
That's why we're here.
Can you handle a bigger package?

336
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,523
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother.
What do you think?

337
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,067
'Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

338
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,111
'Leader of the Juárez cartel.

339
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,072
'He was one of the most
enterprising traffickers in Mexico

340
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,659
'and one of the first to get into business
with his Colombian friends to the south.

341
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,912
'While Escobar saw
the Mexican traffickers as a threat,

342
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,206
'Cali saw them as a partner.

343
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,169
'A partner that shared over 1,900 miles
of virtually undefended border

344
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,172
'with Cali's biggest customer:
the United States.

345
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:22,258
'And right about the time
the Caribbean corridor closed,

346
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,637
'along came NAFTA, and the U.S.
- Mexico border was open for business.

347
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,348
'And Amado took full advantage,

348
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,184
'agreeing to ferry Cali cocaine
into the States.

349
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,770
'They called it
"The Mexican Trampoline",

350
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,982
'bouncing cocaine into America,
and bouncing cash right back.'

351
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,777
I can move however much you give me.

352
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,529
I just have two questions:
How much?

353
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,492
And for how much longer, Pacho?

354
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,119
Because I know about your deal.

355
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,413
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

356
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,834
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

357
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,796
But we have six months
to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

358
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,258
Until then, we will honour
our commitment to you.

359
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,471
Right, and after?
What happens after that?

360
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,975
The business will adjust.

361
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:18,398
This I know. It will always adjust.
This will never end.

362
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,735
There will be other partners
and more drugs. But what about you?

363
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,612
What will happen to you?

364
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:30,535
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

365
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,496
You know this is a way of life.

366
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,957
It retires you when it's done with you.

367
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,462
Or are you going to start playing golf
like an old man?

368
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,270
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

369
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,068
Done.

370
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,071
It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.

371
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:11,409
All right? But...
you have to come with me to Juárez.

372
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,289
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

373
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,710
The future, Pacho.

374
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,213
The fucking future, that's all.

375
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
- Here's your passport.
- Thank you.

376
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,684
All right, and you board through Gate 15.

377
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,019
Okay.

378
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,483
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you.

379
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,693
Have a great day.

380
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,195
Next.

381
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,869
I'm going to Panama.

382
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,205
I need you to radio ahead
to the DEA office.

383
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,457
I'm afraid not. This plane can't take off.
There's new orders.

384
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,459
What are you talking about?

385
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,296
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not looking for that kind of trouble.

386
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,465
Oh, shit.

387
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,597
What the fuck is going on?

388
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,975
Orders are orders.
You heard the ambassador.

389
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,815
Our friends from the Senate here
want the down-low from a real-life hero.

390
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,777
Guess that's you.

391
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,322
You got somewhere better to be?

392
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,492
You wore the wrong shoes.

393
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,000
Fuck.

394
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,092
Is that the Río Negro?

395
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,315
- What do we got here?
- The captain likes this one.

396
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,484
You won't find their name on the lease,

397
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,529
but the Rodríguez brothers
own the top six floors.

398
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,198
Oh, fuck. For real?

399
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,659
I told you,
there are some honest cops in Cali.

400
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,620
Let me reach out to men I trust.

401
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,707
Quietly. Keep an eye on this place.

402
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,586
You go back to Bogotáand...
get a warrant.

403
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,048
Come on, guys,
the place isn't moving anywhere.

404
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,927
Get that paper
and we'll turn this place upside down.

405
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,140
Why wait? Judge in Bogotásigned
a warrant for us before we left.

406
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,146
SEARCH WARRANT

407
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,357
Which you never told me about.

408
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,402
This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.

409
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,362
Are you playing me or what?

410
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,782
Hey, man, it's like you said.
It's so hard to know who to trust.

411
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,744
I wasn't even
sure we were gonna need it.

412
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,164
There's no address on this warrant.

413
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,334
You said this place is connected,
so let's put in some work.

414
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,753
Do you know the kind of shit
I could land in?

415
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,755
Huh?

416
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,758
I don't have a DEA pension
waiting for me.

417
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,219
Pensions aren't that great, to be honest.

418
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,936
Fuck.

419
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,522
Let's do it.

420
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,404
I need a tactical team sent
to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

421
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,531
'Copy that.
Requesting a tactical team

422
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,659
'at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.'

423
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,036
You do realise, don't you,

424
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,081
after we surrender,
all of this shit will end?

425
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,835
No more sitting by the pool,
smoking your cigar,

426
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,672
telling everyone what to do.

427
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,633
Look, Miguel,
I'm tired of telling people what to do.

428
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,553
And no one has ever listened to you.

429
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,848
What's the difference?

430
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,650
But you know what?

431
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:17,988
Never, in human history, have
two brothers accomplished what we have.

432
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,745
We aren't the first people in history
to build an empire, Gilberto.

433
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,207
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

434
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,255
If Mother were alive, she'd be proud.

435
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,717
Brothers are well, nephews are well,
sons are well.

436
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,763
'Boss, we just heard a call

437
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:47,017
'that a tactical team left Jamundí station
heading to 4th Avenue.'

438
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,938
Enrique, where are you?

439
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,023
Watching our visitors from the DEA.

440
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,401
They've been checking addresses
all over town.

441
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,653
But right now, they're stopped,
just doing nothing.

442
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,283
- Yes, but where are you?
- At 15th Street and... 4th Avenue.

443
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,868
Enrique, fuck!

444
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,496
There's a police convoy coming at you!
Get Pallomari out of there now!

445
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,731
Answer, you bastard, answer.

446
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,278
- Hello? What's up?
- 'Listen, it's Salcedo.'

447
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,031
You're going to have unwelcome guests.
Leave now.

448
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,076
I don't have time for this.
I'm supervising an important project.

449
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,788
'That's exactly why I need you
to get out.'

450
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,831
Just because you say so?

451
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,584
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

452
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,836
Listen, this is none of your business.

453
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,339
'I'll bet your desk is covered
with American dollars.

454
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,216
'Look, Guillermo, please.'

455
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,928
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

456
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,346
- Jorge...
- 'Get out of there!'

457
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,431
You do your job and I'll do mine.

458
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,435
This is my job! I'm telling you...
Son of a bitch!

459
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,588
Fuck your mother.

460
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,591
I need you to check the paper shredders

461
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,635
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

462
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,848
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

463
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,934
- Warrant says paper only.
- Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.

464
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,895
- Let's go!
- At least someone's willing to get wet.

465
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,398
Don't worry, you'll be back
in Intelligence Group soon enough.

466
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,818
It's not...
This is a waste of our time, Chris.

467
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,529
And more importantly,
this is a waste of a warrant.

468
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,282
You know what?

469
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,952
Andrew Jackson here says
all we find in this fucking high rise

470
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,370
is a nice view of the city.

471
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,832
Well, I got... whoever this guy is
and he says otherwise.

472
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,965
Fucking shit!

473
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,733
Gentlemen, how may I help you?

474
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,526
Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

475
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,862
All right. I'll let them know you're here
so you can head up.

476
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,991
People love surprises.

477
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,702
Gentlemen, you can't...

478
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,781
You. What the fuck
are you still doing here?

479
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,700
What the fuck am I doing? My job.
We told your associate the same thing.

480
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,369
Sorry, boss, I tried,
but he won't listen.

481
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,371
- You go get the car.
- Please get out.

482
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,623
- I have to finish this. Fuck your mother.
- Take the back stairs.

483
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,583
- Yes, sir.
- Finish what?

484
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,377
My job, Jorge.

485
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,131
No. Please, we have to get rid
of all of that now.

486
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,342
We aren't arguing.
You aren't touching anything.

487
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,302
I've got a method and a system.

488
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,054
A method and a system?

489
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,099
What you've got is ten years of jail time
sitting on your desk, you idiot.

490
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,725
- Get out.
- No.

491
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
Attention!
Colombian National Police!

492
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,358
- Where are the files?
- Get to work. Let's go!

493
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,362
This is an office.

494
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,240
We're working. How can I help you?

495
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,660
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

496
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,166
If that's the case,
I need to see a warrant.

497
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,627
Are you supposed to be in charge?

498
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,382
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

499
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,311
Come on.

500
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,910
Good morning.
I have to see every invoice you have.

501
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,088
This says documents only.
Fuck your mother.

502
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,176
Could you repeat that, sir?
My Spanish is... is a bit rough.

503
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,969
You didn't get that?

504
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,138
- Only papers.
- Documents only.

505
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,432
All right.

506
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,768
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

507
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:21,977
Yes, sir.

508
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,197
Leave it. Let it be.

509
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,616
Chivo, check everything
and make an inventory, all right?

510
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,294
Hey, I like presents.
What'd you get us?

511
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,629
That's private.

512
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,881
Ignacio, please show the gentleman
last year's documents.

513
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,674
This way, please.

514
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,730
Excuse me, sir.

515
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,391
I must insist.

516
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,529
Your phone's off the hook.

517
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,207
Do you have
a bill of lading? Yes? Let me see.

518
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,835
More? Everything.

519
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,253
- Just these?
- And the copies below.

520
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,713
- These as well, no?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,924
- All right. '93. Yeah?
- Those are the most recent.

522
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,767
Grab that.

523
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,564
Looks like you owe me that 20.

524
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,773
Oh, yeah.

525
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,444
You were right.

526
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,689
This area saw the biggest spike
in trafficking after Escobar was killed.

527
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,776
Can't we just spray chemicals
on this place and be done with it?

528
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,655
Unfortunately, agricultural concerns
in the region won't allow it.

529
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,032
That's right.
Chiquita Bananas is down here.

530
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,910
I know those guys. Big contributors.

531
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,706
Okay. Here we are.

532
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,088
Jesus H. Christ.

533
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,634
Must've been one hell of a firefight, huh?

534
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,427
No doubt, sir.

535
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,429
- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills.
- Captain.

536
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,015
- Our advisor on this mission down here.
- How you doing, sir?

537
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,227
He liaised with a team of Colombian
commandos on this raid here.

538
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,898
These guys FARC or traffickers?

539
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,234
Both.

540
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,113
Probably started out doing security
for the traffickers, or extorting them.

541
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,616
FARC wants to overthrow
the government.

542
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,870
Cocaine finances their struggles.
Top of the line.

543
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,125
There's an arms race
going on down here.

544
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,543
And this shit...

545
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,254
...is jet fuel.

546
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,924
You guys ready for lunch?

547
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,344
Lunch?
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

548
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,060
Go. Go. Go.

549
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,614
This 24-hour party thing...

550
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,368
...is tiring after a couple of days.

551
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,916
Can you imagine if it was your life?

552
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,465
What's on your mind?

553
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,511
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

554
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,432
- What? "Get the fuck out"?
- No.

555
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,437
He said that in this world...

556
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,692
...there was no place
for a man like me.

557
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,449
I made a place for myself.

558
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,203
I proved him wrong.

559
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,541
And now, I have to give it all up.

560
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,216
What kind of man would I be
if I gave it all up?

561
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,842
I don't know, brother.

562
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,807
But what I do know is
that you have a couple billion dollars

563
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,227
and the rest of your life
to figure it out.

564
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,236
'What are they giving me?

565
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,530
What do you mean,
what are they giving you?

566
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,990
They took my son, didn't they?

567
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,910
They have to give us something.

568
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,458
- Have they offered you something?
- An apartment.

569
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,628
'Accept it.
Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.

570
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,590
'We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.

571
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,510
- 'Do it, then get back up here.'
- Can you wake Pedro up?

572
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,264
- I want to speak with him.
- 'Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.'

573
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:44,776
- I heard we cut it close today.
- I thought they didn't have a warrant.

574
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,446
That's what I was told
by our friend on the force.

575
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,657
A few more seconds
and we'd have had real trouble.

576
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,619
Those new DEA guys
are sharper than they look.

577
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,706
Well, luckily, we have you.

578
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,544
- Did they get anything?
- Some files.

579
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,298
So nothing. Good.
I'll take care of the rest today.

580
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:10,802
That thing you've got tonight with Paola,
enjoy yourself. Go on.

581
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,567
We got names,
addresses. These files are legit.

582
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,571
- How are you guys?
- Captain.

583
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,866
We'll catalogue
and seal the ones from today.

584
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,285
If you could help us with transport...

585
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,997
Okay, there must be
a misunderstanding.

586
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,251
The files stay here.

587
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,670
We need to sort through these.

588
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,465
As you can see, we know
how to process evidence, Feistl.

589
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,345
- That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.
- It was a CNP operation.

590
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,971
We let you join, support.

591
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,517
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

592
00:41:58,642 --> 00:41:59,935
I'm not.

593
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,230
But anything we find
we'll be sure to share with you.

594
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,233
I was instructed
you should be back in Bogotátonight.

595
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,818
You're going out on the last flight.

596
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,325
He burned us.

597
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,203
Who's that, Chris?
The last honest cop in Cali?

598
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,916
No, man. He clowned me, too.
I'm calling the boss.

599
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,554
Fuck!

600
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,227
Those things ain't going
25 feet down here.

601
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,981
Thanks. Hey, you DOD?

602
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,026
So they say.
But I still ID as a Marine.

603
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,571
I'm part
of the military assistance package.

604
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,031
- CIA?
- Oh, shit. Fuck, no.

605
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,617
Can I get a smoke?

606
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,249
Thanks.

607
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,213
- Where you from?
- The last place? Pendleton.

608
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,758
I was out there teaching Saudi soldiers
how to do jumping jacks.

609
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,595
That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.

610
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:22,392
- So is it really that bad down here?
- Yeah. It is.

611
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,770
You got paramilitary, FARC,
traffickers, us.

612
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,357
Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.

613
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,193
Right, but not hairy enough
for the truth to make its case.

614
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,240
Magazines on those bodies
are 7.62 millimetre.

615
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,952
They go in an AK-47, right?

616
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:47,083
Those guns, the fancy ones,
they chamber in a 5.56.

617
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,381
This whole thing is staged.

618
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:57,552
Those are run-of-the-mill guerrillas.
Peasants, not traffickers.

619
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,262
You know your guns.

620
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,768
I'm gonna head on down.

621
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,274
So very original, Stechner.

622
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,736
Even for the CIA.

623
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:20,533
Yeah, well, sometimes you need
to make the truth a little more... plain.

624
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, how's this for truth?

625
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:33,296
They go home and tell everyone
the war on drugs is a fucking stage show.

626
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:38,051
And all the money they put in
is pissed away.

627
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,555
Even the hero said it's fucked up.

628
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,393
What's that do to your plan?

629
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,271
I'm gonna level with you, fellas.

630
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,440
Sending a five-billion-dollar aid package

631
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:57,112
to a country that's on the verge
of becoming a narco-democracy,

632
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,822
that's a bad look in the Senate.

633
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,701
All due respect, Senator, you're looking
at a petri dish for the next Castro,

634
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,661
and this one's fed by narco dollars.

635
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,997
And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.

636
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,126
Rich dictators
with anti-American hard-ons.

637
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,129
We turn our back on this place,
it all goes to hell.

638
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:24,055
Colombia is perfectly situated to help us
in both Central and South America.

639
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,892
The right American footprint here,
Black Hawks, small arms,

640
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,353
night vision, advisors like Mills...

641
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:35,150
...we help secure a stable Colombia,

642
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,819
and it becomes a beacon for the region.

643
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,655
Well, if you want the American people

644
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,616
to get behind sending
billions of dollars to Colombia...

645
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,412
...we need
a no-fucking-around victory down here.

646
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:50,165
Look, gentlemen,
the Colombian government

647
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,711
is months away from dismantling one
of the biggest drug cartels in history.

648
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,339
And they will do it
without firing a shot.

649
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,926
No body count, no dirty hands.

650
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,804
I can't imagine the folks back home
won't like that.

651
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,850
Agent Peña.

652
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:15,523
What do you think?
Is it true? Is a big win coming?

653
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,446
Agent Stechner and I...

654
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:27,660
...we have a long-standing difference
of opinion on just about everything.

655
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,832
But he and I can both agree...

656
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,544
...a big win is coming.

657
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,770
Glad we're on the same page,
Agent Peña.

658
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,857
So the whole surrender plan
is about fucking fundraising!

659
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,987
The Colombians get a cheque and
you get to play army men in the jungle?

660
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,782
I'm thinking about the next battle,
the one that really counts.

661
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,618
Which means you're willing
to lose this one!

662
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:15,083
The drug war?
Oh, come on, man! We lost it!

663
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,960
You were there!

664
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:22,841
Ever stop and think that anyone
that takes this as personally as you do

665
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,968
is doing it wrong?

666
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,476
- Fuck you!
- Yeah. See ya!

667
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,722
And where are they now?

668
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,765
'I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.'

669
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:14,559
- And the files?
- 'We've got them.'

670
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,227
Are you sure?

671
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:20,106
Look, they tricked me
with that fucking warrant, all right?

672
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,861
'And I couldn't warn you because
we were all together like a fucking family.'

673
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,156
These Americans know
what they're doing.

674
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,617
'They aren't fucking idiots.'

675
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,664
Ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?

676
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,210
No, Dan, you never told me
you did a rotation in fucking Chile.

677
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,923
The accountant.

678
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,760
- You clock his accent?
- No.

679
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:53,306
A little off. You know, he said something:
<i>"Concha su madre."</i>

680
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,767
Okay, what's that?
"Fuck your mother" or something?

681
00:48:55,892 --> 00:49:00,063
Exactly. But then he said
another word: "<i>Cachai."</i>

682
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,358
It's a phrase that they typically
only use in Chile.

683
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,320
And if he's from Chile...

684
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,155
He can be extradited.

685
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,668
'Panama DEA said
no warrant, no detention.'

686
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,629
- Fuck.
- 'Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.'

687
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:28,424
- They know where he went?
- No.

688
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,427
So Jurado could be anywhere.
Fuck!

689
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,431
'Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness
have been trying you. A lot.'

690
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,643
All right, well, put them through
when you get them. I'm on my way back.

691
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,561
- 'And Stoddard?'
- Yeah, boss?

692
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,858
Jurado has a wife in Bogotá.
She's American. Put a tap on her phone.

693
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,404
- I don't think I can do that.
- 'Just do it.'

694
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,956
Well, the truth is, we're
very interested in your proposal, Jorge.

695
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,125
And in your potential for growth.

696
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,254
You've exceeded Paola's description,
which wasn't easy.

697
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,551
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay,

698
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,511
which took us by surprise.

699
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,516
I take my commitments very seriously,
gentlemen.

700
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,020
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
my replacement met the standard

701
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,938
they've come to expect.

702
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,398
Go wait for him over there.

703
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,192
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

704
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:35,283
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

705
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,409
Yes.

706
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:44,042
Look at that son of a bitch.
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

707
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,509
Thank you.

708
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,553
So, a security expert

709
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,974
married to a rising star
in one of Cali's top law firms.

710
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,435
Have you worked together before?

711
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,065
My compliments.

712
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,318
David Rodríguez.

713
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,947
How are you?

714
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,080
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

715
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,793
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

716
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,252
Seriously.

717
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,090
In fact, he's one of our best men.

718
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,591
You see?

719
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,929
Enjoy it.

720
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,307
Ma'am.

721
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:56,906
Where do you know him from?
Is he a friend of yours?

722
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,367
You know Cali is a very small city.

723
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:03,871
Even more so
when one is in the security business.

724
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,916
One must deal with all sorts of people.

725
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,508
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

726
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,427
These documents are very sensitive.

727
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,515
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

728
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,018
All right. Let's go, then.

729
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,902
Open the door, Cordova.

730
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:39,282
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari!
In the front seat.

731
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,034
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

732
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,620
In the front.
I'm not your fucking employee.

733
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,129
Making friends everywhere he goes.

734
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,714
No shit.

735
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,943
Look at this fucking neighbourhood.

736
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,487
This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.

737
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,073
<i>Es el cabrón.</i>

738
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,618
The fucking man.

739
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,265
I haven't been able to reach
an agreement yet. He's very stubborn.

740
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,101
'Listen to me, Pacho.
We have to seal the deal.

741
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,270
'It's very important.'

742
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,775
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

743
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,820
'All right. Keep me informed.
Good night.'

744
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,614
Good night, Gilberto.

745
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,172

It's been a long time
since anyone asked me on a date.

760
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,589
Come in, please.

761
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,013
Take a seat.

762
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:11,642
Sir... your offer of this apartment
is very generous.

763
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,187
But?

764
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,191
But... I would like to know the terms.

765
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,362
The terms?

766
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,823
How often will you come here
to visit me?

767
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,536
As often as you like.

768
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,497
Or never.

769
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,499
This is your home.

770
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,585
Is there a monthly stipend?

771
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,421
A stipend?

772
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:45,051
Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar
when I was 18 years old.

773
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,053
I knew nothing.

774
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:51,682
Now I need to get away from his family,
and I need my son back.

775
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,227
If you could help me with that...

776
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,814
I can.

777
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,568
Then I accept.

778
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,242
It's great to hear that.

779
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:27,510
Why don't you get some rest,
have something to eat?

780
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,513
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send for your son.

781
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,933
How does that sound?

782
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,435
Good.

783
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,729
Take a seat.

784
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,194
Fifty miles an hour,
you could jump into water and survive.

785
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,572
- You can't leave her on the bus.
- I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.

786
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,282
No.

787
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,537
- I would leave her.
- You would leave her?

788
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,540
All right. Here we go.

789
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,970
Dan...

790
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,055
Is that who I think it is?

791
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,809
Gilberto fucking Rodríguez.

792
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,312
Fuck.

793
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,565
Oh, my fucking God. Okay.

794
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,986
- Peña.
- 'Boss, it's Feistl.'

795
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:31,365
- Where the fuck have you been?
- 'Sir, I got eyes on Gilberto Rodríguez.'

796
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,493
- You're looking at him right now?
- 'Yes.

797
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,829
'Just say the word
and we can take him down.

798
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,039
'What's the move, boss?'

799
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,674
Sorry to interrupt.

800
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,095
You want to go
after Gilberto Rodríguez?

801
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,119
