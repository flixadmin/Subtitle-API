What's next for you, love?

I guess I'll give life above ground

Still lucky. And now, also richer.

I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

You are one of these
"poor mortals," now.

Remember that next time
you come across one with a gun?

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,192
Astra, have you seen Sara?

82
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,652
Uh, not recently. Maybe ask Behrad?

Where is my brother?

00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,990
I can't believe
how much we have in common.

85

It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe. We just click.

It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

- We'll pick this up later.

- Hey, have you seen Sara?
- No.

- Ugh.
- [Behrad] Maybe with Nate?

91
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,299
He was headed to the club.

92
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,801
Back? Why?

93
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,805
He met Starman at the after-after.
Said he had to prep for his show there.

94
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,099
- What the hell's a Starman?
- "Major T?"

- What, the future?
- No.

Technically, yes,

100
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,201
but from the future
with a different timeline.

101
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,332
Now, she lives in a totem...
and I'm forced to be at peace with it.

102
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,625
What's her name?

103
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,044
Zari.

104
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,256
Her name is Zari.

105
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,052
And I'm afraid
I'm never gonna see her again.

106
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,595
Hey, Zari.

107
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,515
Guys, this is David Bowie.

108

Marvelous.

109
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,018
Okay, we're looking for Sara.
Is she here?

110
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:55,022
Last time I saw her was at the concert.
I figured she's with you.

Sara disappeared.

- He's singing about Sara?
- Deh-deh-deh.

118

Do not interrupt David's process.

119
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,708
He's trying to cheer me up by singing
a song about Zari 1.0, not you.

120
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,791
Obviously.

121

Listen, is that song you're singing
about Nate's sad love life?

129
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,607
- No.
- Are you singing about Sara Lance?

00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,650
[ice crackling]

163
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,986
[breathing heavily]

164
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,869
[beeping]

165
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,540
[coughing]

166
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,788
[Agent Sharpe] Time to get organized.

167
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,706
- [Nate] Ava, you're back.
- Mmm-hmm.

168
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,833
Oh. Whoa.

169
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,542
[Agent Sharpe] Here you go.

170
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,589
- Girl, are you okay?
- What? I'm fine. Why?

171
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,713
We thought that...

172
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,759
With Sara being lost,
you may wanna sit this one out.

173
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,345
Not lost, she is pre-found.

174
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,156
There's a solution to all problems,
including this.

175
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,683
- Wow. Indexed. Thorough.
- You are all the best of the best.

176
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,061
If we handle this logically, rationally,

177
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,538
- we'll get Sara back.
- [Constantine] Right.

178
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,439
This is a waste of time.

179
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,441
- I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

180
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:11,862
Ever since I rescued her from Purgatory,
Sara and I have a psychic connection.

181
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,782
It'll locate her,
and everything I need is at the mansion.

182
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,408
Damn it! That's insubordinate.

183
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,779
But I won't try to stop you.

184
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,039
He's most effective
not left to his own devices.

185
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,499
- I can just...
- Thank you, Z.

186
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,167
- We'll fix this.
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,548
Astra, would you mind
keeping them on mission?

188
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,969
- I'm not really on the team, so...
- We're accepting outside help. Thanks.

189
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,053
[sighs]

190
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,393
Okay. I need to calm down
and do some research.

191
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,518
Right now?

192
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,980
- Sara needs us.
- I'm freaking out.

193
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,481
[Agent Sharpe] Come on, B.

194
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,862
Ah, Mick, perfect timing. Check on any
leads you may have in the underworld?

195
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,197
This whole thing's not gonna work.

196
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,159
Nothing works without Sara.

197
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,827
So, you're just gonna drink?

198
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,370
Real mature, Rory.

199
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,250
You got this figured out.
What do we do?

200
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,002
Call the experts, the DEO.

201
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,754
- Good idea-ish.
- What?

202
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
Will it get weird
with you and Alex Danvers

203
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,259
'cause she and Sara had a fling?

204
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,137
Swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

205
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,401
[metal creaking]

206
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,528
[thudding]

207
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,793
Are you okay?

208
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,341
Whoa.

209
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,342
Who are you?

210
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,179
I'm Spartacus, the undefeatable.

211
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,599
Oh, yeah, that "undefeatable" part
didn't quite stick.

212
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,518
Uh...

213
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,022
Wait. Hey, get back here!

214
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,986
[Constantine chanting]

215
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,118
[breathing heavily]

216
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,704
[exhales]

217
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,708
Sorry, did you find Sara?

218
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,088
No. [spits] Care to wet your whistle?

219
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,008
I'm confused. What did you learn?

220
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,053
That Sara Lance is far beyond my reach.

221
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,722
You told Ava you could reach her.

222
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,641
I over-promised.

223
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,103
You can't give up on Sara.
There's gotta be something you can do.

224
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,772
- Come on. Anything?
- Look, aliens took her,

225
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,274
all right, to space.

226
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,360
This is really not my area of expertise.

227
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,238
If it was a ghost, a demon,
or even a handle of whiskey,

228
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,949
I could help you out with that,
but I'm sorry.

229
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:06,954
I'm an astrologer...
and you need an astronomer.

230
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,123
What an ass.

231
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,875
Yeah, he does have that going for him.

232
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,629
Look, he's right.
This is out of his league.

233
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,381
Out of all our leagues.

234
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,007
I disagree.

235
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,803
Astra, let's talk about your network.

236
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,641
"My network?"
I've been on Earth for five minutes.

237
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,435
Exactly.

238
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,145
[telephone ringing]

239
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,293
[Agent Sharpe] <i>Gideon, why isn't
the DEO answering?</i>

240
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,028
[Gideon] The Department of Extra
Normal Operations was destroyed

241
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,238
in the infamous year 2020 by Rama Khan.

242
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:45,117
Nate, this is a huge setback.
We needed the DEO.

243
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,161
- Aliens is their jurisdiction.
- Yeah.

244
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,704
- [sighs]
- [Gideon] Captain Sharpe,

245
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,664
we are dealing with a temporal anomaly.

246
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,458
According to the original timeline,

247
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,753
there was no alien spacecraft
over London in 1977.

248
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,630
Meaning... this is our jurisdiction.

249
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,841
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

250
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,886
[laughs] No. We're the experts?

251
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,970
Damn right, we are.

252
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,597
You, me, the Legends,

253
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,142
we're the only ones capable
of handling time-traveling aliens.

254
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,394
If I trusted the team,
I wouldn't have made

255
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,605
an entire binder
to get rid of them, okay?

256
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,357
The DEO was plan A.

257
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,942
Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends,

258
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,111
so, welcome to plan B.

259
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,738
Breathe it in with me.

260
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,073
- No.
- Come.

261
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,532
[both inhaling]

262
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,534
Plan B smells like pot.

263
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,203
I got something.

264
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,871
You are a walking contact high.

265
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,374
You're welcome. Gideon, put this up.

266
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,668
- [Nate] Cute kid.
- That's a tabloid.

267
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,297
Tabloids help me not think about how
we live in a technological terror,

268
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,466
hurtling through a green nightmare.

269
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,842
Damn.

270
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:49,348
So, this girl, Esperanza Cruz,
says that she was abducted by aliens,

271
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,017
and from then on,
she could communicate with them.

272
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,520
- They implanted something in her head.
- B!

273
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,982
This is a tabloid. From 20 years ago?

274
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,404
- It's probably fabricated. I need leads.
- She's real, man. Gideon located her.

275
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:07,282
I mean... little kid
with alien tech in her head.

276
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,493
- Not a bad lead.
- Okay, sure.

277
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,162
Fine. Whatever. It's all we've got.

278
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,081
Rory's probably getting boozed up.

279
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,167
Why don't you take Mickey
and go investigate this Esperanza...

280
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,710
- What's her last name?
- Cruz.

281
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:22,089
Are we sure bringing Mick
to talk to a kid is best practices?

282
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,050
No. You're going to see her present day.

283
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,553
We are trying
not to mess with the timeline.

284
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,056
Right. The timeline. Aye, aye.

285
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,516
You're excused.

286
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,017
Ugh!

287
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,775
What is it?

288
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,196
I was confined
to one of these glass prisons.

289
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,157
You were as well.
Means there are also others inside.

290
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,701
You just figured that out now?

291
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,120
I did. I was the commander of an army

292
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,623
of 120,000 slaves, gladiators and
peasants against the Roman Republic.

293
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,625
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mmm. Excellent.

294
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,752
We'll liberate our fellow prisoners,

295
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,546
rebel against our captors...

296
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,089
We don't know who's in there!

297
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,927
Rise, compatriot.

298
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,055
I'm your savior. I am Spartacus.

299
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,685
[growls]

300
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,899
[shrieks]

301
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,444
What pray tell are you, a Saxon?

302
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,655
No. That's definitely an alien.

303
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,743
[roars]

304
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,501
[grunts]

305
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,840
- [grunts]
- [shrieks]

306
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,721
A little help here!

307
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,643
- [Sara grunting]
- [shrieks]

308
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,453
[exhales]

309
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,750
The thrill of the battle reminds me
of being back in the Colosseum.

310
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,294
You just stand there
in the Colosseum, too?

311
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,505
I was letting it tire itself out.

312
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,800
If it had slain you, I'd have been
rested and avenged your death.

313
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,347
Being an avenger is stupid.

314
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,849
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

315
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,477
You want to join the Preventers, Sparty?

316
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:42,853
Yes.

317
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,607
Good choice. Now, stop opening pods.

318
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,570
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

319
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,989
and we'll prevent them from breathing.

320
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm telling you, Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

321
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,458
We're gonna find Sara.

322
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,086
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

323
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,798
When the universe shows you a sign,
you should believe it.

324
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,133
Is that right?

325
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,553
The universe exists for one reason...
to kill you.

327
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,062
Hello, Miss Cruz. Ma'am?

328
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,065
Must not be home.

When they split up,
we'll take them out one by one.

332
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,653
Nonsense. We have
the element of surprise.

333
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,072
Tackle the savages,
slay them in one fell swoop.

334
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,990
We've no idea what they're capable of.

335
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,160
I was an Assassin.
Rule number one, isolate your targets.

336
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,246
We don't fight from the shadows.

337
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,874
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

338
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,793
I assure you, they are all dead.

339
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,212
I must avenge them.

340
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,589
No avenging.
No more avenging, it's preventing!

341
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,633
Prepare to die, savages! [groans]

I am very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

Look, maybe I can help you... [mutters]

347

Oh! Whoa!

348
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,430
- Why would you do that?
- [Zari] Astra has a lead.

349
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,435
Okay. All right, she has a lead.
Go ahead.

350
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,397
I heard about this guy who was once
in Hell, raved about aliens.

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,109
- His name was Aleister Crowley.
- Aleister bloody Crowley.

352
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,777
Come off it. He's a kook.

353
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,380
[Zari] That's the conventional wisdom.

354
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,282
He'd this tome of secrets
called the <i>Book of the Law.</i>

355
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,160
In it,
Crowley detailed these alien encounters

356
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,497
and spells that these aliens taught him,
but he disappeared from Hell.

357
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,500
Maybe he used
these alien spells to escape.

358
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,628
Yeah. Crowley didn't escape, all right?

359
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,715
I summoned him,
and then I trapped him on Earth.

360
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,509
You trapped...
Sorry, isn't that a felony?

361
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,472
No. But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

362
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,682
What did you do with the book, John?

363
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,727
Okay. Seeing as
we don't have any other ideas,

364
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,563
I kept it safe right over...

365
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:18,236

about nicking my things, eh?

Bloody hell, Gary'd be reading Crowley,
I had no idea.

There it is.

[Mick] If she can talk to aliens,

00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,352
why would she live in a redneck dump?

You're right,
but isn't it worth making sure?

<i>Besides, Ava really needs a win.</i>

This isn't about me.

Don't give me that look.

00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,076
- What look?
- You know what look.

"Feel better not bottling up emotions?"

391

I'm not bottling them up.

00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,623
- I don't wanna talk about them.
- Okay.

- I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

394
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,754
You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

395
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,675
I am setting aside my feelings to
focus on the goal of getting Sara back.

You should, too.

I wonder what's in there.

Let me guess, more dumb redneck stuff.

She's not such a dumb redneck after all.

Great. Two more abductions.

404
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,349
Why we don't talk about emotions
during the mission.

405
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,352
Gideon's scanning for heat signatures.
It'll be okay.

- Yeah.

Far from okay.

They just got further, love.

409
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,443
We found something in Gary's room.

410
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,654
A human-sized chrysalis.

411
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,112
We don't understand.

412
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,199
Gary is an alien.

413
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,744
An alien? Oh, my God.
Okay, I don't buy it.

414
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,038
We also found these.

415
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,749
Gary's glasses.

416
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,251
Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

417
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,088
And brace yourselves.

418
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,802
No.

[gasps]

420
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,766

[gasps]

422
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,982
I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

423
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,023
Spartacus?

424
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,734
Oh, no, no, no.

425
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,821
You. Spartacus was just my boss' lunch.

426
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,158
But don't worry,
I don't eat humans... anymore.

427
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,743
Terrific.

428
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,454
I couldn't go through
with your abduction

429
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,289
'cause I fell in love with you,

430

with Ava, with all humans.

431
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,169
That's funny, because I still feel
very abducted, Gary.

432
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,507
My boss, Kayla, found us.
But I'm loyal. That's why I saved you.

433
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,010
- You saved me?
- Yeah.

434
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,595
I rigged the pod
to open with your handprint.

435
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,389
Gary, where are we going?

436
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,017
No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

437
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,854
- I don't blame her.
- You and I are also not okay.

438
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,066
You have any idea how wrecked
Ava must feel right now?

439
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,695
I'm sure she's pretending
to keep it together for everyone else,

440
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,488
but inside, she must be dying.

441
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,118
Stop! It's torture to even think about
what Ava is going through.

442
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,329
Do me in. I deserve it.

443
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,291
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stanned.

444
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,835
Knock it off. You'll help me get home.

Tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

Well... when you first met
you butt heads...

Any fool can tell
you were meant for each other...

Ava, Nate.

Are you guys okay?

[Behrad] <i>Yeah, it is very far

Trespassers have regained consciousness.

00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,540
They were armed with fancy weapons.
Not sure why.

459
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,459
Only one way to find out.

460
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,090
Told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

461
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,843
- What was that, old timer?
- I wasn't talking to you, Miss Crazy.

462
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,556
- I don't like being called that.
- He didn't mean that.

463
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,975
I go by "Spooner," now.

464
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:45,021
Okay, Spooner. Ma'am,
this is all just a misunderstanding.

465
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,692
The alien communicator in your head,
use it to find our friend.

466
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,196
Y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

467
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,364
but to kidnap me?

468
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,034
- We were going to ask. We still are.
- What?

469
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,118
Shh.

470
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,746
- Will you come with us?
- Come with you?

471
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,582
But you ain't going.

472
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,008
Hurry. She's getting
real friendly with her knife.

473
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,389
Who were you talking to?

474
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,724
He's a schizophrenic. Talks to himself.

475
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,686
It's true. It's a nervous tic, actually.

476
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,733
Hey, wait. Hey. Hey, wait.

477
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,735
Wait. Hey, hey! [screaming]

00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,945
<i>No!</i>

479
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,488
Behrad? What's happening?

480
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,407
[continues screaming]

481
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,828
The universe ripped his comms out.

482
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,455
[static]

483
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,000
[Gideon] Captain,
I've pinpointed their location.

484
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,211
Thank God.
I'm not losing any more Legends today.

485
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,630
<i>Gideon, take the ship to that location.</i>

486
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,757
A ship?

487
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,676
[echoing] Nate, you're with me.

488
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,304
Hang on. Why is my voice echoing?

489
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,599
She hacked my comms.
She can hear everything.

490
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,450
That thing against the <i>Waverider?</i>

491
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,539
Touché, Spooner.

492
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,629
Please, stop shooting my ship!

493
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:38,301
Don't come any closer!
I won't let you all abduct me again!

494
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,386
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

495
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,306
That's what you think?
That we're aliens?

496
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,850
- What the hell else could you be?
- No, no.

497
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,268
We're time travelers.

498
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,646
- Time travelers?
- Yes.

499
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,189
That's our time ship.

500
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,942
Also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

501
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,778
I'm sorry that we trespassed, okay?

502
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:00,490
It was wrong, but we're desperate.

503
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:05,870
Listen, the woman I love
was abducted by aliens last night,

504
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,250
and I just found out
that she's gonna propose to me.

505
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,631
[voice breaking] I will do anything
if you can find her.

506
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,510
Will you please help me?

507
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,890
Exactly what an alien would say.

508
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:26,975
[groans]

509
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,522
Now can I burn this place down?

510
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,698
Can we go over the plan once more?
Still feels slightly suicidal.

511
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,784
We don't have enough fuel
to turn around and go home.

512
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,869
- We commandeer the ship.
- From Kayla,

513
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,664
my vicious, violent
and very vindictive boss.

514
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,083
Open a wormhole
to Earth's temporal zone.

515
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,751
An unstable rip in spacetime.

516
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,628
Then, we fly the ship through it.

517
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,046
On whatever fumes remain

518
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,757
after we burn everything
opening the wormhole.

519
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,217
We better get moving.

520
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,803
First, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

521
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,806
Right. Okay.

522
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:09,976
Here goes nothing.

523
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,314
Gary... your glasses.

524
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,772
Oops!

525
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,945

[grunts]

528
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,029
All right, guess we do it this way.

529
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,615
[shrieks]

530
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,079
Okay, wormhole time.

531

535
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,321
Morning, sunshine.

536
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,452
Tables have turned,
but I ain't going down without a fight.

537
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,788
- Whoa. We're not gonna hurt you.
- Look.

538
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,668
Where the hell am I?

539
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,671
Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

540
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,756
- This is our time ship.
- [Spooner] Admit it.

541
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,219
- You're being nice to find your friend.
- A hundred percent, yes.

542
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,681
Even if I wanted to help you, I can't.

543
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,181
Why not?

544
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,018
This thing in my head, it's an antenna.

545
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,980
If I send a signal,
the aliens could find me.

546
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:23,484
Look, we have the technology
to remove whatever's in your head...

547
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,070
if you help us find Sara.

548
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,782
- How's my signal gonna locate her?
- It doesn't have to.

549
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,785
Our friend'll direct it to the aliens
that she's with.

550
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,288
[chuckles] You think we're weird,
wait till you meet John.

551
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:40,751
So, I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

552
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,753
His name is Gary.

553
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,256
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

554
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,467
Ah. Green, yeah, now it makes sense.

555
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,011
You make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

556
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,513
then astral project myself
to Gary's location.

557
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,057
Then I'll look for Sara.

558
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,436
How do I connect to this, Gary,
alien who I've never met?

559
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,938
You'll drink a potion of sorts.

560
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,524
One delicious smoothie. Good luck.

561
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,569
Crowley's spell needs you to ingest
something of Gary's.

562
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,447
- The chrysalis is all we've got.
- Seriously?

563
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,530
She's not going...

564
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,534
The sooner this is over,
sooner it's outta my head.

565
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,120
But I hope it works. <i>Salud!</i>

566

[all exclaiming]

567
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,749
She did it.

568
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:23,544
Kinda tangy.

569
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,341
All right, ready?

570
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,095
After my abduction,
I wear tin foil hats.

571
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,722
It blocks any alien signals.

572
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,059
Huh. Nifty. Right, on with the show.

573
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,187
[chanting]

574
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,498
I can feel him.

<i>I found the alien.</i>

576
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,337
Dweebier than I thought.

577
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,005
Bloody Crowley was right.

578
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,968
I can sense him. He's worried
and wants to come down to Earth.

579
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,761
He's trying to help Sara.

580
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,014
I just need to step into
the Sigil and find her.

581

[Constantine groans]

582

- Spooner's connection is unstable.

583
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,813
Giving it everything
to maintain it.

584
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,439
- I'll do it.
- Are you crazy?

585
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,692
You'll kill yourself.
Look what's happened.

586
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,403
It's plan B, Nate. Embrace it.

Gidget said you'd dehydrated.

Yeah, even if alien magic is real,

Crowley is a slippery fish.
He's not to be trusted.

Hmm. Whatever you say, roomie.

That was a short residence
on the <i>Waverider,</i> eh?

Yeah. I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

I'm not as enamored of the timeline

It's like you said,

Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you.

640
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,107
You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

641
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,441
[laughs]

642
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,319
And come on, John,

643
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,446
"just a fling?"

644
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,157
She's got you on a juice cleanse.

645
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,253
[Behrad] Sure you won't stick around?

646
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,382
You've got a pretty chill vibe
beneath your gun-toting-outcast vibe.

647
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:47,553
Look, we contacted your friend,
and I'm sorry she's not back yet.

648
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,681
But I want this removed,
so I can live a normal life.

649
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,602
I get that. You want to keep it zen
in the brain stem.

650
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,896
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

651
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,151
What do you see, Gideon?

652
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,407
- [Gideon] Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Really? Look closer?

653
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,534
[Gideon] If I removed
and dissected her brain,

654
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,203
we might find something
the scan did not detect.

655
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:15,664
- May I proceed?
- What's going on out there?

656
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,416
No. Don't kill her, Gideon.

657
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,042
I can hear it.

658
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,796
- I wasn't gonna let her.
- You can't hear it, can you?

659
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,673
[chittering]

660
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,135
They're all around us.

661
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,809
Never seen anything like this
in the temporal zone.

662
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,895
Aliens, lots of them.

663
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,855
[Behrad] They're falling
into the timeline.

664
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,691
[clicking and chittering]

665
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,657
[sighs]

666
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:53,869
Why are you smiling?
We gotta clean this mess up.

667
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,537
I know.

668
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,457
The only person
who could create this much mayhem

669
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,460
is Sara, which means she's alive.

670
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:05,214
If the universe shows you a sign,
you should believe it.

671
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:07,383
[grunts triumphantly]

672
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,722
[Gary] Engaged?

673
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,391
I'm so happy, I could cry.

674
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,185
If we don't get through the wormhole,
we are stuck.

675
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,229
[Gary] I'm going as fast as I can.

676
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,148
I'm sorry, I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancée.

677
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,235
Wait, you and
that other alien are engaged?

678
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,905
Her name's Kayla. Yeah.
The wedding's off. Did I mention that?

679
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,574
Talk about this later.
Get us through that wormhole.

680
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,201
Yeah. [grunts]

681
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,956
[both] We're gonna make it!

682
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,376
[Sara grunts]

683
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,336
We didn't make it.

684
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,421
[screaming]

685
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,476
[Bowie singing]

686
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,106
<i>Space girl, floating away</i>

687
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:08,861
<i>Space girl, gravity betrayed her</i>

688
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:13,615
<i>Space girl, a punk rock treasure</i>

689
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,286
<i>Space girl, goodbye forever</i>
