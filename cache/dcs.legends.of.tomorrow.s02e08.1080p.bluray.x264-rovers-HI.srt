According to my calculations,

93
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,828
if Lily's impact on history remains
small enough,

94

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,063
And who's to say they didn't take him
to the FBI like they said they would?

157
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,812
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,
October 24th, 1931.

158
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,574
<i>Ah, yes, the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion.</i>

159
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,949
<i>Only in this version of history,</i>

160
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,077
<i>he becomes something
far worse than a criminal,</i>

161
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,613
<i>he becomes a politician.</i>

162
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,873
Al Capone becomes mayor?

163
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,834
Okay. I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

164
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,462
Well, let's find out where they took him
so we can un-screw him

165
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,248
before this happens.

Special Agent Ness,
you're having a hell of a first day.

168
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,183
How do you know who I am

169
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,469
and when I was coming to town?

170
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,933
Some new friends of mine,

171
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,439
they whispered in my ear.

172
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,601
So me and the boys decided
we would get you a nice welcome present.

173
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,144
Cement galoshes,

174
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,108
very popular in Chicago these days.

175

<i>I have a feeling these will be
just your size.</i>

176
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,280
<i>Oh, come on, try them on.</i>
(LAUGHS)

177
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,446
Any luck finding Ness?

178
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,453
By the time you find Ness,
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

179
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,877
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.

180
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,788
About time someone noticed.

181
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,504
Gideon, set the course to
shipping harbor, Dock 39.

182
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,213
What makes you so sure he'll be there?

183
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,550
In the 20s, Dock 39 is where Capone
brought all of his enemies and

184
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,136
tied cinder blocks to their feet
and tossed them in the harbor.

185
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,301
It became known as "Cadaver's Cove."

188

and the Feds,
well, they're bad for business.

189
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,399
The Bureau of Investigation will
never stop fighting,

190
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,151
not until the fight is done.

(LAUGHS) Poetic.

192
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,660
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

193
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,324
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

194
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,538

- I like it!
- CAPONE: Nice get-ups!

197
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,508
Seems our new friends have
got some friends of their own.

198
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,009
Get 'em boys.

199
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,906
I'm going after Capone!

200
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,370
Let 'em go, we've got Ness.

201
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,365
HEAT WAVE: Is he dead?

202
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,746
Unconscious, he took in a lot of water.

203
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,379
Merlyn was right, they took the bait.

(ELECTRICAL WHIRRING)

<i>It will take some time
to reverse his brain damage.</i>

You can undo brain damage?

208
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,267
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

209
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,605
GIDEON: <i>Who says I haven't?</i>

210
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,736
All right, let's get serious.

211
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,613
Obviously, Capone somehow knew that Ness
would be the one to take him down.

212
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,616
When we were at the docks, Capone said
something about having "new friends."

213
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,078
We have a bigger problem.
I mean another problem.

214
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,334
This week, Ness and his team are
supposed to obtain.

215
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,960
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

216
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,292
Now, the IRS' case against Capone

217
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,253
for tax evasion is completely
dependent on that ledger.

218
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,920
Which Ness can't grab while
he's lying here with brain damage.

219
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,465
Exactly, which means one of us has
to take his place.

220
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,141
RORY: That's a stupid idea.

221
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,599
It's pre-internet.
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

222
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,263
Nate's right. I got this.

223
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,144
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

224
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,607
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission was
impersonating Brad Pitt, you'd be the man.

225
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,988
But I think we can all agree, if anyone
here looks like a G-man here, it's me.

226
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,617
Well, we're in this situation because you
learned history from a movie.

227
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,277
All right, enough.

228
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,456
Ray, I'm sorry but Nate knows
more about this era than any of us.

229
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,075
What's the plan?

230
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,494
Okay, so if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

231
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,664
it's probably at his primary speakeasy,
The Chelsea Club.

232
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,674
So, Ray and I will go to the Bureau,
assemble Ness' team,

233
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,461
lead them to bust the place up,
grab the ledger.

234
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,130
Great, take Rory with you.

Does this face look like a cop to you?

237
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,936
If this were a JSA mission,

238
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,142
we'd probably also send someone
undercover at the club.

239
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,684
Well, I'm not doing that either.
I'm done playing dress-up.

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,309
Well, I've assembled the team

I hope they're ready for some action
because they're going to get it.

Tonight, we're going to take down
The Chelsea Club.

254
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,517
Our files say Capone's got nothing
to do with that place.

Well, your files are
embarrassingly outdated.

256
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,026
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

257
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,192
and furthermore, he hides a sizeable
amount of Canadian whiskey in there.

258

You fellas sure do know an impressive
amount about Capone's organization.

Yeah, that's why it's
called a "speakeasy."

But why kidnap Sara and Stein?
I mean, what could he want with them?

309
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,928
- Still trying to work that one out.
- Are you all right, Jax?

310
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,809
- I'm pissed.
- RORY: <i>Let it go, kid.</i>

311
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,354
There's nothing you can do
about the speedsters.

312
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,764
We'll see about that.

313
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,026
Long story short, Rip had a secret armory.

314
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,814
Me and Grey found it alongside future
Barry's message about the oncoming war.

315
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,904
This speedster killed Rex and
kidnapped our friends,

316
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,535
- we need him in the brig before dawn.
- Yeah.

317
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,822
If this weapon does what I think it does,

318
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,114
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

319
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,624
Yeah. Well, that's all well and good,

320
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,002
but we still need to get Capone's ledger
back, otherwise history is screwed.

321
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,046
Since your last plan was a total bust,

322
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,583
I suggest somebody else
do the strategic thinking.

323
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,094
Let me guess, that's you. All right,
so let's hear your brilliant idea.

324
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,718
Well, I don't have one but it's going
to be better than yours.

325
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,882
RORY: Enough!

326
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,928
If you want to nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

327
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,937
you can't do it by playing a Boy Scout
or a historian or a policeman.

328
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,691
We do this my way.

329
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,940
Like a criminal.

330
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,988
(GASPS)

331
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes.

332
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,786
The Ritz Carlton, it is definitely not.

333
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,294
How did we get here?

334
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,876
It appears our speedster friend
got the better of us.

335
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,417
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

336
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,673
Damien Darhk, a rather

337
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,588
predictable bedfellow for Al Capone.

338
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,810
And don't forget about me.
It's been a long time, Sara.

339
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,685
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

340
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,102
Why am I not surprised that you
and Damien Darhk would find each other?

341
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,521
What do you want with us?

342
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,197
You have something we need.

343
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,530
And while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

344
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,657
I would like to broker a deal with you.

345
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,622
You have in your possession an amulet.

346
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,992
Give it to me

347
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,454
and I will give you nine years
of your life back.

348
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,130
What are you talking about?

349
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,007
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

350
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,712
but I was the one who arranged to
blow up the Queen's Gambit.

351
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,962
(SCREAMS)

352
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,680
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

353
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,765
hundreds of dominoes toppling.

354
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,687
<i>Dr. Ivo,</i>

355
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,190
Slade Wilson, the League of Assassins.

356
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,943
Losing your sister.

357
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,812
And you losing your son.

358
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,196
We both get clean slates.

359
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,825
Why don't you just ask your
speedster-friend to take you back in time?

360
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,495
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy,

361
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,618
sent to retrieve the amulet.

362
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,292
- Why is it so important?
- What does it matter?

363
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,706
I'm giving you and your sister a chance
to live normal lives.

364
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,216
To go back, maybe go to college,

365
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,299
meet a nice boy or a girl and settle down.

366
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,213
No, thank you.

367
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,549
I was never meant for those things.

368
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,726
And I know that now.

369
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,227
And besides, you can't just go back
and change things like that.

370
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,767
(LAUGHS) What? Why not?

371
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,732
Because time is sacred

372
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,981
and it can't be changed to suit
any one person's desire

373
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,446
without harming the lives
of countless others.

374
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,071
But you wouldn't remember any of this,
would you?

375
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,083
You would be blissfully unaware
of time travel,

376
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,083
of loss, of heartbreak.

377
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,967
You'd be happy. And isn't that what
matters most in the end?

378
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,343
SARA: <i>Hey, Malcolm!</i>

379
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,512
I'll take a nightmare that's real
over a dream that's a lie.

380
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,439
That was remarkably selfless.

381
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,446
Well, I had a good teacher.

382
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,445
Yes. Captain Hunter.

383
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,984
No.

384
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,121
I was talking about you.

385
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,467
What the hell?

386
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,467
Shoot her!

387
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,475
MAN: Come on. Let's get out of here.

388
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,647
Hi, I'm Clyde, that's Bonnie.

389
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,981
Get out of the truck!

390
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,322
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

391
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,782
Yes, where's the truck headed?

392
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,705
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

393
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,990
- Much obliged.
- (GRUNTS)

394
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,709
Hold that. (GRUNTING)

395
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,544
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- (ENGINE STARTING)

396
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,958
Nate and Ray?

397
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
Those idiots have done nothing
but get in the way.

398
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,636
Uh, guys, we're standing right here.

399
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,515
Whoa. Get in the back.

400
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,681
I can't believe Malcolm thought
I would actually take that deal.

401
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,728
You really weren't tempted?

402
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,483
Of course.

403
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,028
But we can't let a man like that
change history.

404
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,397
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.

405
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,495
Ah, yes, when it comes to time travel,
even the best of us can wreak havoc.

406
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,492
What do you mean?

407
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,990
Martin?

408
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,670
You have been acting weird
ever since we fought the Dominators.

409
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>What's going on?</i>

410
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,417
It was an innocent mistake.

411
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,717
I was just trying to give myself
a bit of marital advice.

412
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,632
Never did I imagine
it would ever have an effect.

413
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,893
You caused an Aberration?

414
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,930
I have a daughter.

415
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,894
A what?

416
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,106
A full-grown,

417
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,396
human progeny

418
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,739
who I never even knew I had!

419
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,741
This beautiful, brilliant...

420
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,072
And not real.

421
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,579
At first, no, but

422
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,406
then I remembered.

423
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,917
I remembered the countless nights I spent,

424
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,998
pacing the neighborhood with her
stroller trying to get her to sleep.

425
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,090
(STAMMERS) The way my heart

426
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,423
melted the first time she smiled at me.

427
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,763
The distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher,

428
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,602
when she insisted on singing the
periodic table instead of the alphabet.

429
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,767
(STUTTERS) I remembered all of it.

430
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,267
- But none of that happened to you.
- But the memories

431
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,395
are real. (SIGHS)

432
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,113
They're a part of me now.

433
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,776
She is a part of me now.

434
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,117
And I love her.

435
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,286
Martin, you were the one who talked me
into not killing Damien Darhk.

436
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,456
And to not bringing my sister back because
of the damage it would do to history.

437
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,961
(SIGHS) I'm sorry
but my ears were burning.

438
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,052
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice

439
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,805
and offer you a deal.

440
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,513
Since you didn't bite, we're gonna have
to be a little rougher.

441
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,981
Do your worst.

442
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,026
You didn't think that I meant you?
(LAUGHS)

443
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,364
Oh, I fear with your League training,
torture, while fun,

444
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,900
would be a waste of time.

445
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Sara,

446
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,161
whatever you do, don't give them anything!

447
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,045
- No!
- Martin!

448
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,665
<i>Martin!</i>

449
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,176
(GRUNTING)

450
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,012
Professor Stein. Am I right?

451
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,851
Do I know you?

452
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,185
Let's just say it's complicated.

453
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,032
I'm not going to lie to you,
this, um, little toy

454
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,911
usually leaves the subject,
well, dead, but

455
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,949
I've adjusted it so that
you should only feel a little pain.

456
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,449
(WHIRRING)

457
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,959
In theory.

458
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,502
(SCREAMING)

459
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,103
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?

460
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,269
Vinny, he's, uh,
hanging out with your mother.

461
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,607
- What?
- What?

462
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
So, here's the plan...

463
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,740
Is for us to rescue the people
that got caught because of you.

464
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,866
- She's talking about you.
- No, I think she's talking about you.

465
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,032

I'm going to have to teach you
a few new lessons.

I remember you.

You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

Mr. Rex Tyler, was it?

Don't worry.
You'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.

632
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,025
I gave you an out.

Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

634

I've already found a better life,

- Where is he?

00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,015
My dear, that information comes at a cost.

638
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,943
Don't look so glum, Professor.

639
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,606
You'll be in good company at the bottom
of this here river.

(CHUCKLING)

645
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,131
The speedster,
how did you manage to defeat him?

646
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,974
I didn't, I made him a counter-offer.

647
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,312
I gave him the amulet.

648
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,644
I still don't understand. The last thing
I remember was getting off the train.

649
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,187
Everything else is a blur.

650
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,980
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.

651
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,822
After our investigation, we concluded
you were kidnapped by an imposter.

652
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,909
Some idiot posing as you,
trying to bring down Capone.

653
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,200
The gentleman who was impersonating you
was trying to do the right thing.

654
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,915
Luckily, he found some useful information.

655
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,078
What's this?

656
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,247
Everything you need to know
to take down Capone.

657
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,093
If you look closely, you'll find some
discrepancies in his bookkeeping.

658
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:38,014
You expect me to believe that Al Capone
is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?

659
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,679
Sounds screwy.

660
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,561
Actually, it'll make
a pretty good movie one day.

661
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,564
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

662
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,903
why does it take four more years
for them to take him down?

663
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,027
Because it's the federal government.

664
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,121
Now, that's the Mick Rory I remember,
always thinking with his stomach.

665
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,410
Shut up!

666
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,624
Who are you talking to?

667
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
Nobody.

668
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,046
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.

669
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,390
- That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?
- I got a thick head.

670
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,265
- What's that? (CLEARS THROAT)
- A little present.

671
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,853
For keeping me alive and for helping me
almost get Rex's killer.

672
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,142
Open it.

673
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,407
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.

674
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,859
You stole it, huh?

675
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,660
You were right.
The bad guys really do have more fun.

676
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,206
Not that you're a bad guy.

677
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,712
I hope it was worth it.

678
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,884
All this for a kiss on the cheek
and a cheap bottle of booze.

679
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,799
That speedster could have
killed you, Mick.

680
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,880
What then?

681
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,555
I'd be dead like you.

682
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,102
(SCOFFS) My evil doppelgänger left
quite a mess.

683
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,521
It will take me weeks
to reorganize my notes.

684
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,190
It's good to have you back. The real you.

685
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,154
Well, thanks to your efforts.

686
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,620
Though I have to say I am a bit puzzled.

687
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,663
Professor Stein, puzzled?

688
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,826
Protecting history is our
team's raison d'être.

689
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,166
Yet you traded the amulet to our enemies.

690
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,798
A choice which will no doubt
have countless repercussions on history.

691
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,501
I'm starting to think that

692
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,462
maybe some things are
more important than history.

693
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,011
You know, you, me and this team,

694
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,054
we're a family.

695
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,187
A messed up one but still a family.

696
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,609
I might not be able to save Laurel
but I can protect this family.

697
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,562
And that includes yours.

698
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,610
What's her name?

699
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,784
Lily.

700
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,904
Lily.

701
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,997
It's a beautiful name.

702
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,409
We should leave soon.

703
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,455
You're certainly in a hurry
to get out of 1927.

704
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,966
Not your concern, Malcolm, particularly
now that we have what we came for.

705
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,467
Well, now that we have the matching set,

706
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,503
do you care to tell us why we went through
so much trouble?

707
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,140
They are not a matching set.
In fact, they are not a "they."

708
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,801
They are an "it."

709
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,514
It's an amulet, in two pieces.

710
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,472
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

711
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,234
Wow. It's a portable planetarium.

712
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,402
It's a compass.

713
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,777
Compasses generally find things.

714
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,944
Indeed.

715
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,489
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

716
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,286
Yes, It was the spear that was reportedly
used to penetrate the side of Christ,

717
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,703
after he died on the cross.

718
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,749
And now it can be used to rewrite
reality itself.

719
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,336
- So how do we find it?
- Well, it's complicated.

720
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,840
But the first step is with the person
that Mr. Darhk met briefly in New York.

721
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,008
You remember Captain Rip Hunter?

722
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,897
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

723
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,441
- RIP: Cut!
- (ALARM RINGING)

724
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:31,699
I told you idiots to move
these garbage cans.

725
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,038
Can we try

726
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,587
to get this right, people?

727
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,123
I don't wanna be here all night.

728
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,972
Am I talking to myself? Today!
