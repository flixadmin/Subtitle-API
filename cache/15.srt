1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in
my power to change the future,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one fast
enough to keep her alive.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,216
I am The Flash.

24
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:00,218
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:01,854
Previously on "The Flash"...

26
00:00:01,864 --> 00:00:01,879
&nbsp

27
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,030
The Philosopher's Stone has
been the key to everything.

28
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,055
&nbsp

29
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,348
So we destroy the Stone,
and Savitar is gone for good.

30
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:07,373
&nbsp

31
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:08,715
There's only one thing
we can do with it.

32
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:08,754
&nbsp

33
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:09,987
Throw it into the Speed Force.

34
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:09,989
&nbsp

35
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:11,309
I have to do what I can to help.

36
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:11,334
&nbsp

37
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,629
I'm the guy who avoided
his dying mother for weeks.

38
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:13,654
&nbsp

39
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,403
I have a whole lot to make up for.

40
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:15,428
&nbsp

41
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:17,668
I like you, Julian, but
I'm also afraid of my powers

42
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:17,693
&nbsp

43
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:20,073
and what they could do to
anyone who gets close to me.

44
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:20,098
&nbsp

45
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,660
I didn't ask for these powers,

46
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,685
&nbsp

47
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:24,211
just like you didn't ask
to be used by Savitar.

48
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:24,236
&nbsp

49
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:26,102
I think we should be terrified together.

50
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,127
&nbsp

51
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:27,338
Sure. Together it is.

52
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:27,363
&nbsp

53
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:29,617
It's crazy how fast I've
gotten in such a short time.

54
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:29,642
&nbsp

55
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:30,986
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

56
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:31,011
&nbsp

57
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,587
I'm not gonna save Iris
from Savitar; you are.

58
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:34,780
&nbsp

59
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,181
Iris West, will you marry me?

60
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:46,485
&nbsp

61
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:48,352
_

62
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:57,002
&nbsp

63
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:00,326
And Wally just beat his personal best.

64
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:00,351
&nbsp

65
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,740
Oh, Barry's putting him
through the wringer today.

66
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,741
&nbsp

67
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,708
Excuse... Barry? Excuse me?

68
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:04,710
&nbsp

69
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,310
Uh, yeah, I suppose it could be Barry,

70
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,312
&nbsp

71
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:09,012
or it could be his genius
coach, whose sole purpose

72
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:09,014
&nbsp

73
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,613
on this Earth is milking epic greatness

74
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:11,638
&nbsp

75
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:12,965
from those around him.

76
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:12,990
&nbsp

77
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,785
Thank you very much.

78
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:14,787
&nbsp

79
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:17,621
- It could also be Jesse.
- What?

80
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:17,623
&nbsp

81
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,090
Come on, Wally doesn't want
to get beat by his girlfriend.

82
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,092
&nbsp

83
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,806
Also, please, just refrain from...

84
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:22,831
&nbsp

85
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,962
using "milk" as a verb
from now on, please.

86
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,048
&nbsp

87
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,236
I'm getting kind of dizzy.

88
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:29,261
&nbsp

89
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,502
You're supposed to get dizzy, Wallace!

90
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:31,504
&nbsp

91
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,851
You're supposed to get
exhausted on this route.

92
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:33,876
&nbsp

93
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,015
It's supposed to simulate

94
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:35,040
&nbsp

95
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,507
the stress that you're gonna feel

96
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:36,509
&nbsp

97
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,475
when you finally confront Savitar,

98
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:38,477
&nbsp

99
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,386
so my suggestion to you
is, suck it up, buttercup!

100
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:41,411
&nbsp

101
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,205
Milking epic greatness.

102
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:43,230
&nbsp

103
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,381
Yeah, no kidding.

104
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:44,406
&nbsp

105
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,386
Why don't you take it
down a little, tiger mom?

106
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:46,629
&nbsp

107
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,362
Barry and Jesse are at the final mark.

108
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:48,387
&nbsp

109
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:49,925
Get ready.

110
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:50,322
&nbsp

111
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:52,409
Wally's at the home stretch.

112
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,241
&nbsp

113
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,007
Come on...

114
00:01:55,017 --> 00:02:06,975
&nbsp

115
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,294
- Guys?
- 0.21 seconds.

116
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:11,443
&nbsp

117
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,470
0.21.

118
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,746
&nbsp

119
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:16,880
Just fast enough to
save Iris from Savitar.

120
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:16,882
&nbsp

121
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,016
You did it.

122
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,533
&nbsp

123
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,150
- You did it.
- We did it.

124
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,175
&nbsp

125
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,314
- You did it!
- You did it.

126
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:29,562
&nbsp

127
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:30,961
You okay?

128
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:31,541
&nbsp

129
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,664
Uh, yeah, yeah.

130
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:33,666
&nbsp

131
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:36,088
I'm just... happy.

132
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:36,408
&nbsp

133
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:38,089
We all are, Wally.

134
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:38,114
&nbsp

135
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,341
We all are.

Julian. Hi.

140
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,285
&nbsp

141
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:49,752
- Ah, Caitlin, how are you?
- How are you? It...

142
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:49,949
&nbsp

143
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,115
You've come straight from the airport?

144
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:52,117
&nbsp

145
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,349
Uh... yes, yes, uh...

146
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:54,374
&nbsp

147
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,002
Barry said he had something
to tell me. Is he here?

148
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:57,004
&nbsp

149
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:58,946
He'll be here any minute, I'm sure.

150
00:02:58,956 --> 00:02:58,971
&nbsp

151
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,478
- Shall we? Yeah?
- Yes, we shall.

152
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:00,480
&nbsp

153
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,980
We shall.

154
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,650
&nbsp

155
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,750
- Look who I found.
- Hey, guys.

156
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:05,752
&nbsp

157
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,619
Oh!

158
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:07,621
&nbsp

159
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,521
- How are we doing?
- Julian.

160
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:09,523
&nbsp

161
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,725
It's good to see you.
Good to see you all.

162
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:11,750
&nbsp

163
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,758
Jesse, I thought you were
heading back to Earth-2.

164
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:13,760
&nbsp

165
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,000
I actually decided to stick
around for a little while.

166
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,281
&nbsp

167
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,565
Hey, does anybody know what's going on?

168
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:20,567
&nbsp

169
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,901
I mean, I got a mountain of
paperwork back at the office.

170
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:22,903
&nbsp

171
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:25,203
No, not the foggiest.
I was gonna ask you.

172
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:25,205

173
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,549
Ah. Welcome home, James.

174
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:27,574
&nbsp

175
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,041
Can I brew you a proper cup of tea?

176
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:30,043
&nbsp

177
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,810
And a robust pick-me-up for you, mate.

178
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:31,812
&nbsp

179
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:33,878
No need. We hit Jitters on the way.

180
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:33,880
&nbsp

181
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,991
Got everybody something. You guys are...

182
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:36,016
&nbsp

183
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,316
I thought you were on deadline.

184
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:38,318
&nbsp

185
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,651
I am.

186
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,348
&nbsp

187
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:42,841
You ready?

188
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,755
&nbsp

189
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,434
- For you.
- Here.

190
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,259
&nbsp

191
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,933
Okay. What is going on with you two?

192
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:49,958
&nbsp

193
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,130
- Uh, do you want to?
- Mm-mm.

194
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,132
&nbsp

195
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,366
This is all you.

196
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:54,368
&nbsp

197
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,234
- Okay, here goes.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:56,236
&nbsp

199
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,324
Um...

200
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,273
&nbsp

201
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,873
No!

202
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:01,875
&nbsp

203
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:04,275
Congratulations! That's so exciting!

204
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,078
&nbsp

205
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:06,711
Thank you. Thanks.

206
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:06,713
&nbsp

207
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:09,347
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Wow.

208
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:09,613
&nbsp

209
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:12,183
You did it. This is...
this is fantastic.

210
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:12,185
&nbsp

211
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,394
Well done, Joe. Congratulations.

212
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,391
&nbsp

213
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,058
Dad, say something, please.

214
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:27,401
&nbsp

215
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,200
My baby girl.

216
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,905
&nbsp

217
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,590
You have grown into a beautiful woman.

218
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,009
&nbsp

219
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,976
You're marrying the best man I know.

220
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:37,978
&nbsp

221
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,829
Thanks.

222
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,247
&nbsp

223
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,480
You two bring me nothing but joy.

224
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:42,482
&nbsp

225
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,616
- I'm so happy for you.
- Okay.

226
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:44,618
&nbsp

227
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,516
This cuteness right here, I cannot...

228
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:47,554
&nbsp

229
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,357
- Congrats.
- Thanks, man.

230
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:49,382
&nbsp

231
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:50,388
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

232
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:50,390
&nbsp

233
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,190
And speaking of, um,

234
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,192
&nbsp

235
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,758
best man...

236
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:53,760
&nbsp

237
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,224
I'll do it. Of course.

238
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:55,249
&nbsp

239
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,195
When Barry and I first met...

240
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:57,197
&nbsp

241
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:58,830
- H.R.
- You mean him.

242
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,832
&nbsp

243
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,697
Okay, good.

244
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:00,867
&nbsp

245
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:02,033
I...

246
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:02,035
&nbsp

247
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,695
I'd be honored. Really.

248
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:03,720
&nbsp

249
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,235
I mean, as long as I
can get that plus-one.

250
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:06,260
&nbsp

251
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,826
'Cause, you know, me and Gypsy,

252
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:07,828
&nbsp

253
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,628
we about to tear up the
dance floor for you guys.

254
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:09,630
&nbsp

255
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,063
Barry.

256
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:11,065
&nbsp

257
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,298
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

258
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:16,067
&nbsp

259
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,501
Now, I wanted to be sure that
you heard what I said in there.

260
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:18,503
&nbsp

261
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,002
I couldn't be happier.

262
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:20,004
&nbsp

263
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,537
Okay, right.

264
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:21,539
&nbsp

265
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:23,249
So...

266
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:23,575
&nbsp

267
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,908
why didn't you ask my permission?

268
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:25,910
&nbsp

269
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,429
I mean, I told you the story

270
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:27,454
&nbsp

271
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:29,589
of me asking Francine's
dad's permission,

272
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:29,614
&nbsp

273
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,668
like, a hundred times.

274
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:31,693
&nbsp

275
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:34,217
At least, yeah. And
that's a great story.

276
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:34,219
&nbsp

277
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,219
Eh, but you missed the point?

278
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:36,221
&nbsp

279
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,587
I... yeah, I...

280
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:37,589
&nbsp

281
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,089
I don't... it was spontaneous.

282
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:40,091
&nbsp

283
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:43,316
I knew you'd say yes, and
I wanted to surprise you.

284
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,896
&nbsp

285
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:47,205
Yo. There's a three-alarm
fire in the Raab building.

286
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:47,230
&nbsp

287
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,731
Fire department is evacuating it now.

288
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:48,733
&nbsp

289
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:50,633
Jesse is a little
preoccupied with the ring,

290
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:50,635
&nbsp

291
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,868
- so it's just you and me.
- Okay.

292
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:51,870
&nbsp

293
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,733
- What you two waiting for? Go.
- Yeah.

294
00:05:53,743 --> 00:06:07,218
&nbsp

295
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,751
Wallace...

296
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:08,753
&nbsp

297
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:10,553
Wallace West.

298
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:14,926
&nbsp

299
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:16,497
Wally...

300
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:23,961
&nbsp

301
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,447
What the hell?

302
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:29,474
&nbsp

303
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:31,095
Wally.

304
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:31,609
&nbsp

305
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,942
Hey.

306
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:32,944
&nbsp

307
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:34,766
What's happening? What's wrong?

308
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:34,791
&nbsp

309
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,111
Where'd he go?

310
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:36,541
&nbsp

311
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,322
Who?

312
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:38,347
&nbsp

313
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,749
Where is he?

314
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:39,751
&nbsp

315
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,184
Who? Where is who?

316
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,181
&nbsp

317
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,490
Savitar.

318
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,650
&nbsp

319
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,283
I feel fine.

320
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:52,285
&nbsp

321
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,052
So now Savitar's mind-punking you...

322
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:56,077
&nbsp

323
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,654
Oh, boy.

324
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:57,679
&nbsp

325
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,478
This never stops never stopping.

326
00:06:59,488 --> 00:06:59,480
&nbsp

327
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,447
How long has this been going on, Wally?

328
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:01,449
&nbsp

329
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,249
- Like a week.
- A week.

330
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:03,251
&nbsp

331
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,184
Wally, why didn't you
say anything before?

332
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:05,186
&nbsp

333
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,321
Because I didn't know what this was.

334
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:08,323
&nbsp

335
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,289
I thought that this was
just maybe in my head.

336
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:10,291
&nbsp

337
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,536
You know, I wasn't looking at it
like I was keeping it to myself.

338
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:12,561
&nbsp

339
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:14,085
That's exactly what
you did, though, Wally.

340
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:14,110
&nbsp

341
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,155
You did keep it to yourself,

342
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:15,187
&nbsp

343
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:16,753
and with Savitar, that's
not something we can do.

344
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:16,755
&nbsp

345
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,936
This is Iris' life we're talking about.

346
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:18,961
&nbsp

347
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,955
- Yes, I know that.
- Do you, though, Wally?

348
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:20,980
&nbsp

349
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,765
- Yes.
- Uh, okay.

350
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,470
&nbsp

351
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,029
Until now, you only saw him, right?

352
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,032
&nbsp

353
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,170
Yeah, this was the first
time it was physical.

354
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,195
&nbsp

355
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,873
What... he wasn't there!

356
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:30,898
&nbsp

357
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,132
Okay? You weren't fighting him.

358
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:32,157
&nbsp

359
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,390
He was messing with your head.

360
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,415
&nbsp

361
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,788
- It was all in your mind.
- I've been there. Done that.

362
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:35,813
&nbsp

363
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:36,906
It's miserable.

364
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:36,931
&nbsp

365
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:39,179
Okay, why don't I run
a brain scan on Wally,

366
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,204
&nbsp

367
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:41,906
see if he was similarly affected
to when Julian was possessed?

368
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:41,931
&nbsp

369
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,297
Yeah, that's fine. Why don't we do that?

370
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:43,322
&nbsp

371
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,343
Wally shouldn't be in here anyway.

372
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:46,215
&nbsp

373
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,796
- What?
- Barry, he knows he messed up.

374
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:48,821
&nbsp

375
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,954
That's not what this is
about, okay? Look, it's...

376
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:50,979
&nbsp

377
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,577
if Savitar's using Wally
the same way he used Julian,

378
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:53,602
&nbsp

379
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:56,624
how do we know he's not spying
on us through Wally right now?

380
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:56,649
&nbsp

381
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,265
Wally, we don't know how this works.

382
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:58,290
&nbsp

383
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,046
How do we know he can't see
and hear everything we're doing?

384
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:01,952
&nbsp

385
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:03,262
Look, you're out.

386
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:03,264
&nbsp

387
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,648
- I'm out?
- I'm sorry, Wally.

388
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:04,673
&nbsp

389
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:05,695
Yeah, you don't sound real sorry.

390
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:05,720
&nbsp

391
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,445
All right, fellows,
let's take a quick ten.

392
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:07,470
&nbsp

393
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,367
We're all still the
"Four Amigos" here, right?

394
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:10,392
&nbsp

395
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,492
What?

396
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:11,517
&nbsp

397
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,983
You don't have that movie on this Earth?

398
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,008
&nbsp

399
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,109
- I'll go talk to him.
- Yeah, talk some sense into him.

400
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,134
&nbsp

401
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,401
- All right.
- So what now?

402
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:17,634
&nbsp

403
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,834
Well, we know from the future

404
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:19,859
&nbsp

405
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,659
that Savitar gets out of wherever he is,

406
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:21,684
&nbsp

407
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,918
but for now, he's still trapped, so...

408
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:24,566
&nbsp

409
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:27,598
- I need to talk to him again.
- No, I knew you were thinking this.

410
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:27,623
&nbsp

411
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,644
All right? And I won't do it.

412
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:28,669
&nbsp

413
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,144
I'm not gonna be your
personal walkie-talkie to him.

414
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:31,169
&nbsp

415
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,832
Guys, we can't. We don't have the Stone.

416
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:33,857
&nbsp

417
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,598
Actually, we can.

418
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:35,623
&nbsp

419
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,790
We still have Savitar's
spatial frequency

420
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:37,815
&nbsp

421
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,481
from when we plugged
in Linda Blair here,

422
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:39,506
&nbsp

423
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:41,673
so I think we could
work without the Stone.

424
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:41,698
&nbsp

425
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,598
Julian, I'm sorry, man. We
don't really have a choice.

426
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:43,623
&nbsp

427
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,894
Oh, we do have a
choice. I have a choice.

428
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:45,919
&nbsp

429
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,848
And I choose to decline.

430
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:47,873
&nbsp

431
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,301
I'm sorry.

432
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,415
&nbsp

433
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:52,655
- We're starting to fray.
- Well, we can't. All right?

434
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:52,680
&nbsp

435
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,055
Everybody just needs to trust me.

436
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:54,095
&nbsp

437
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:55,555
I know what I'm doing.

438
00:08:55,565 --> 00:09:00,921
&nbsp

439
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,352
Come to talk me into it, then?

440
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:03,432
&nbsp

441
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,639
No.

442
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:04,882
&nbsp

443
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,581
Barry's lost his
bloody mind if he thinks

444
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:06,583
&nbsp

445
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:10,252
I'm gonna volunteer
to be... abused again.

446
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:10,254
&nbsp

447
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:12,087
He's just trying to protect Iris.

448
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:12,089
&nbsp

449
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,322
We all are.

450
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:13,324
&nbsp

451
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:16,258
But... not like that.

452
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:17,728
&nbsp

453
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:20,862
Is the reason you don't
want to do this because...

454
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:20,864
&nbsp

455
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:22,955
you don't want me to see it?

456
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,370
&nbsp

457
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,545
I just think...

458
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:28,570
&nbsp

459
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,396
hearing his voice coming out of me, I...

460
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:31,421
&nbsp

461
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,586
it just makes it impossible
for you to see me as a normal...

462
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:34,611
&nbsp

463
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:35,974
Hey.

464
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:36,292
&nbsp

465
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,425
I've had somebody else's
voice coming out of my mouth,

466
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:38,450
&nbsp

467
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,224
and you were still
able to see the real me.

468
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:41,518
&nbsp

469
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:44,186
How about trusting that
I can do the same thing?

470
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:53,432
&nbsp

471
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:54,807
Sorry.

472
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:54,832
&nbsp

473
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,331
I just wanted to do that,

474
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:56,356
&nbsp

475
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:59,619
in case you changed your mind later.

476
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,237
&nbsp

477
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:02,003
Quite all right.

478
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:05,242
&nbsp

479
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:07,008
Julian, you're gonna be okay.

480
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:07,010
&nbsp

481
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,343
You know the drill.

482
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:08,345
&nbsp

483
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,971
Just let your mind go blank.

484
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:09,996
&nbsp

485
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:12,363
We'll take care of the rest. Okay?

486
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:12,950
&nbsp

487
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,877
Just let Savitar back in
the driver's seat once more.

488
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:16,387
&nbsp

489
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,087
- Brilliant.
- Thank you.

490
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:18,159
&nbsp

491
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,018
Let's just get this over with, yeah?

492
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:29,800
&nbsp

493
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,077
Bow before my greatness.

494
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:32,102
&nbsp

495
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:35,218
Be in awe, as you are in
the presence of the Almighty.

496
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:35,243
&nbsp

497
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,405
Enough with the... religious nonsense.

498
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:39,483
&nbsp

499
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,818
You were just a man. Like me.

500
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:41,843
&nbsp

501
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,712
I'm nothing like you, Barry.

502
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:43,714
&nbsp

503
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,715
You're cruel, you're selfish.

504
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:46,717
&nbsp

505
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:50,018
From my perspective, you're the big bad.

506
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:50,020
&nbsp

507
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,834
Stupid.

508
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:52,543
&nbsp

509
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,566
Still here, pretender?

510
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:54,591
&nbsp

511
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,750
Still trying to find your place?

512
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:56,775
&nbsp

513
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:58,093
I found my place.

514
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:58,095
&nbsp

515
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,895
It's standing here with these people,

516
00:10:59,905 --> 00:10:59,897
&nbsp

517
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:01,463
against you.

518
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:01,465
&nbsp

519
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,065
You know, the sad
thing is that you live.

520
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:04,067
&nbsp

521
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,934
You survived my wrath.

522
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:05,998
&nbsp

523
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,579
The coward.

524
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:08,144
&nbsp

525
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,672
- Irony.
- Where are you?

526
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:10,674
&nbsp

527
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:12,774
You said that I trapped
you in the future, where?

528
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:12,776
&nbsp

529
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:14,845
The only place that you could think of.

530
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:15,056
&nbsp

531
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,379
The only place that could hold me.

532
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:17,381
&nbsp

533
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,214
How long have you been imprisoned?

534
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:19,216
&nbsp

535
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:22,684
Long enough to lose my
mind several times over.

536
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:22,686
&nbsp

537
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:26,354
It's only my will that keeps
me on this side of sanity.

538
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:26,356
&nbsp

539
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,557
You know, it's funny,
when I think of sanity,

540
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:28,559
&nbsp

541
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,992
I don't necessarily think of Savitar.

542
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:30,994
&nbsp

543
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:34,062
Well, that's because
you're small, Cisco.

544
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,064
&nbsp

545
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:36,231
You've always been small.

546
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:36,233
&nbsp

547
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:39,034
Reverb told you that you
could have been a god.

548
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:39,036
&nbsp

549
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:43,238
But instead, you'd rather
work as... tech support.

550
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:43,240
&nbsp

551
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,307
You want to tell me why we're enemies?

552
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:45,309
&nbsp

553
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,476
Because we had to be.

554
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:47,478
&nbsp

555
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,634
Only one of us could live.

556
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:49,659
&nbsp

557
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:52,525
You thought that Thawne and Zoom

558
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:52,550
&nbsp

559
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,950
were your biggest foes, but...

560
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,085
&nbsp

561
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:56,869
but it's me.

562
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,636
&nbsp

563
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:00,104
It's always been me, Barry.

564
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:00,224
&nbsp

565
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:01,957
Man, what did we ever do to you?

566
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:01,959
&nbsp

567
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:05,111
You took everything from me!

568
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:05,662
&nbsp

569
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:08,376
I never asked for any of this, Joe.

570
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:08,738
&nbsp

571
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:12,548
I am only this way because of you.

572
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:12,803
&nbsp

573
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:14,102
All of you!

574
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:14,104
&nbsp

575
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,437
When do we meet?

576
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:15,439
&nbsp

577
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:16,872
Not long now.

578
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:16,874
&nbsp

579
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,174
You're there when I become who I am.

580
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:19,176
&nbsp

581
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,409
You're saying I caused
you to get your speed?

582
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:21,411
&nbsp

583
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,972
- I created you?
- Oh, no.

584
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:23,997
&nbsp

585
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,777
I created myself, Barry.

586
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,050
&nbsp

587
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,918
Only I can bring out my greatness.

588
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:29,920
&nbsp

589
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,453
Your greatness?

590
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:31,455
&nbsp

591
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:32,921
Well, you're still trapped,

592
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:32,923
&nbsp

593
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,356
wherever you are,

594
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:34,358
&nbsp

595
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:35,924
and I don't know how
you're gonna escape.

596
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:35,926
&nbsp

597
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:39,106
I mean, we got rid of
the Philosopher's Stone.

598
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,603
&nbsp

599
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:41,969
Did we?

600
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,684
&nbsp

601
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:47,043
I am closer to my freedom

602
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:47,068
&nbsp

603
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,014
than I have ever been.

604
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:49,039
&nbsp

605
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:51,814
Every step, every move that you make,

606
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:51,839
&nbsp

607
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:54,314
it only brings me nearer to it.

608
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:54,392
&nbsp

609
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,415
I only need one more thing.

610
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:56,440
&nbsp

611
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,564
Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.

612
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:00,350
&nbsp

613
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,518
Iris, trying to show
that you're not afraid?

614
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:04,575
&nbsp

615
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,675
But I know you are.

616
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:06,700
&nbsp

617
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,253
I'm sorry that you have to die.

618
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:09,635
&nbsp

619
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:12,806
But it's you or me.

620
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:13,072
&nbsp

621
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,314
And despite your feeble
efforts to change the future,

622
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:16,388
&nbsp

623
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,254
you can't,

624
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:18,335
&nbsp

625
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,853
because I am the future, Flash.

626
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:21,420
&nbsp

627
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,888
Barry, you've had to
suffer worse than anyone.

628
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:24,913
&nbsp

629
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:28,043
You've endured pain your whole life.

630
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:28,068
&nbsp

631
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:29,868
Your mother,

632
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:30,291
&nbsp

633
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,324
your father...

634
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:32,349
&nbsp

635
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,915
Trust me,

636
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:34,274
&nbsp

637
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,954
you'll never get over this.

638
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:45,094
&nbsp

639
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,727
Well...

640
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:46,752
&nbsp

641
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,385
Well?

642
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:48,410
&nbsp

643
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,804
Good chat, was it?

644
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,205
&nbsp

645
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:52,738
I-I don't know if I can take another

646
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:52,740
&nbsp

647
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,507
one of those séances.
Anyone else with me?

648
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:54,509
&nbsp

649
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,609
I almost filled my drawers.

650
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:56,611
&nbsp

651
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:59,490
Okay, so other than Savitar taking

652
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,515
&nbsp

653
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,714
scaring-the-bejeezus-out-of-us
to a whole new level,

654
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:01,716
&nbsp

655
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:03,482
did we actually learn anything?

656
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:03,484
&nbsp

657
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,351
- Please say yes.
- Maybe.

658
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:05,353
&nbsp

659
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,587
When I mentioned the Stone,
he questioned whether or not

660
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:07,589
&nbsp

661
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,988
we'd really gotten rid of it.

662
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:08,990
&nbsp

663
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,990
We did. We threw it
into the Speed Force.

664
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:10,992
&nbsp

665
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,510
That's like throwing
it into outer space.

666
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,535
&nbsp

667
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:15,049
Uh, maybe we didn't. I mean,
maybe there's more to it.

668
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:15,074
&nbsp

669
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,829
- A second Stone?
- Or maybe the Stone

670
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:16,831
&nbsp

671
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,364
that we had was part of a larger piece.

672
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:18,366
&nbsp

673
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,485
How about the Acolytes?

674
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:19,510
&nbsp

675
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,233
Maybe they know something we don't.

676
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:21,235
&nbsp

677
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,202
- Hey, what about that one guy?
- Craig?

678
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:23,204
&nbsp

679
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,237
Yes, the Acolyte that you dropped in on

680
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:25,239
&nbsp

681
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,906
when you went all cold?

682
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:26,908
&nbsp

683
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,908
His car's GPS has him located

684
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:28,933
&nbsp

685
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,877
somewhere near... Mount Buccelato.

686
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:31,879
&nbsp

687
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,346
Buccelato, that's miles away.

688
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:33,348
&nbsp

689
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,047
What... what would he
be doing over there?

690
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:35,049
&nbsp

691
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,983
There's one way to find out.

692
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,487
&nbsp

693
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:41,087
Talk to us. What do you see?

694
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:41,089
&nbsp

695
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:44,326
Some serious "Temple of Doom" stuff.

696
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:45,760
&nbsp

697
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,159
They have a box.

698
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:47,161
&nbsp

699
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,462
God of Speed, soon
your enemies will fall

700
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:49,464
&nbsp

701
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,163
and you will rise once more on Earth.

702
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:51,165
&nbsp

703
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:53,499
It looks just like the last
one that held the Stone.

704
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,501
&nbsp

705
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,599
- You were right, Barr.
- What are you gonna do?

706
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:55,624
&nbsp

707
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:57,560
I'm gonna go see what's in it.

708
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,245
&nbsp

709
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:06,812
What exactly were you
guys doing up here?

710
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:06,814
&nbsp

711
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,055
Worshipping His Greatness.

712
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:09,111
&nbsp

713
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,875
Let's see how far he gets without this.

714
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:12,047
&nbsp

715
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,953
He's ten steps ahead of you.

716
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:13,955
&nbsp

717
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,988
There's no stopping Savitar.

718
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:15,990
&nbsp

719
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,456
If I were you...

720
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,550
&nbsp

721
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,590
I'd move up the wedding.

722
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:30,151
&nbsp

723
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,152
So far... not so good.

724
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:33,154
&nbsp

725
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,420
Can't get any readings off of it.

726
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:34,807
&nbsp

727
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,355
It's the same as the last time.

728
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:36,357
&nbsp

729
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,445
Are we sure this isn't the same box?

730
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:38,470
&nbsp

731
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,226
Well, it can't be. I mean, I threw
the other one into the Speed Force.

732
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:41,228
&nbsp

733
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,759
Yeah, but you said the
explosion sent you to the future.

734
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:43,784
&nbsp

735
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,809
What if it did something
to the box too, you know?

736
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:47,940
&nbsp

737
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,601
I hate to say it, Barry, but,

738
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:49,603
&nbsp

739
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,064
after all my years of research,

740
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:51,089
&nbsp

741
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,689
I've never heard or come
across another box or Stone;

742
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:53,714
&nbsp

743
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,093
I think this is it.

744
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:55,119
&nbsp

745
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,532
If that's true, we need
to consider the possibility

746
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:57,557
&nbsp

747
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,444
that Savitar has that Stone.

748
00:15:59,454 --> 00:15:59,446
&nbsp

749
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,118
I'm gonna check for radioactive isotopes

750
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:01,143
&nbsp

751
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,791
or gravimetric force residue,

752
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:02,816
&nbsp

753
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:04,247
'cause if it's the
same as the last time...

754
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:04,272
&nbsp

755
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:05,966
We're in big trouble.

756
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,698
&nbsp

757
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,033
You can go faster than that, Wally. Run!

758
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:11,058
&nbsp

759
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,557
And...

760
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:12,582
&nbsp

761
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,169
time!

762
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:14,682
&nbsp

763
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:18,150
Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh...

764
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,175
&nbsp

765
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,464
good.

766
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:19,645
&nbsp

767
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,166
We need to go again.

768
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:21,168
&nbsp

769
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,168
But I don't understand. I
was fast enough this morning.

770
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:23,170
&nbsp

771
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,603
Now all of a sudden, I'm too slow?

772
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:24,628
&nbsp

773
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:27,182
You're in your head. You gotta
get out of your head, man.

774
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:27,207
&nbsp

775
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:30,075
You gotta just run, you gotta
push everything else to the side.

776
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:30,100
&nbsp

777
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,620
Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it!

778
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:31,645
&nbsp

779
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,601
- Okay. Okay.
- All right?

780
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:34,275
&nbsp

781
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,575
All right. Why not?

782
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:36,616
&nbsp

783
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:38,016
I don't know.

784
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,653
&nbsp

785
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,120
I do.

786
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,720
&nbsp

787
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,353
You're afraid.

788
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:43,590
&nbsp

789
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,590
Which is... I totally understand.

790
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:45,592
&nbsp

791
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,214
I mean, if I were in your
shoes, I'd be terrified.

792
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:48,239
&nbsp

793
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:49,910
But...

794
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:49,935
&nbsp

795
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,261
you can't run from a
place of fear, all right?

796
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:53,567
&nbsp

797
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,400
Nobody can do anything effectively

798
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,402
&nbsp

799
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,435
coming from a place of
fear. Trust me, I know.

800
00:16:57,445 --> 00:16:57,437
&nbsp

801
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,137
Savitar can get inside my head.

802
00:16:59,147 --> 00:16:59,139
&nbsp

803
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,505
What am I supposed to do

804
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:00,507
&nbsp

805
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,937
if he does that at the wrong time?

806
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,157
&nbsp

807
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,335
It sure would be a lot easier if I just

808
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:06,380
&nbsp

809
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,580
knew exactly how that night went.

810
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:08,582
&nbsp

811
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,098
Would it ever.

812
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:14,221
&nbsp

813
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,787
Are you picking up
what I'm putting down?

814
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:15,789
&nbsp

815
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,848
Uh-huh.

816
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,356
&nbsp

817
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,822
Let's go.

818
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:19,059
&nbsp

819
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,426
No way. I'm not gonna vibe you there

820
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:21,428
&nbsp

821
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,061
for you to watch your sister die.

822
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:23,063
&nbsp

823
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:24,550
Okay. Cesco, Cesco, Cesco...

824
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:24,575
&nbsp

825
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,431
th-this is to help Wallace...

826
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:26,433
&nbsp

827
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:27,932
to help him see what happens

828
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:27,934
&nbsp

829
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,834
so he knows what to do in the moment.

830
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:29,836
&nbsp

831
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:30,847
Come on, Cisco, please.

832
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:30,872
&nbsp

833
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,512
If Savitar's coming back and I'm
the only one that can save Iris,

834
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:33,537
&nbsp

835
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:36,042
I have to do everything I
can to make sure that happens.

836
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:36,067
&nbsp

837
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,120
And you're sure you want to do that?

838
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,145
&nbsp

839
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,769
Because this is not something
you can unsee, Wally.

840
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:39,878
&nbsp

841
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,880
If this is gonna help
me save my sister, yeah.

842
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:41,882
&nbsp

843
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:43,615
I have to see it.

844
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,617
&nbsp

845
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:44,855
Please.

846
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:45,542
&nbsp

847
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:47,986
Okay, if you have to see it...

848
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:47,988
&nbsp

849
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:51,056
come on down, be my guest.

850
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:51,058
&nbsp

851
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,924
H.R., you know how to work this, right?

852
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:52,926
&nbsp

853
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,692
I know how to work this, yeah.

854
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:54,694
&nbsp

855
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,890
Anything goes wrong, you
get Caitlin down here stat.

856
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:56,915
&nbsp

857
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,514
I know what I'm doing.
I was here the last time.

858
00:17:58,524 --> 00:17:58,539
&nbsp

859
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,202
I saw what you did. All
I got to do is do this.

860
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,304
&nbsp

861
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,140
- The other one.
- It's the other button.

862
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,846
&nbsp

863
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,513
Bit of a lighter touch
next time, please, H.R.!

864
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:15,515
&nbsp

865
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,864
- Copy. Lighter touch.
- This way.

866
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,461
&nbsp

867
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,894
Don't!

868
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:20,919
&nbsp

869
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:22,376
This is it.

870
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:22,401
&nbsp

871
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,525
Okay.

872
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:23,550
&nbsp

873
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,759
So that's the distance I need to cover.

874
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:25,784
&nbsp

875
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,217
Don't do this!

876
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:27,242
&nbsp

877
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:30,176
Now, finally, I am free of you!

878
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:30,201
&nbsp

879
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:32,532
Barry, I love you.

880
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:32,557
&nbsp

881
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,009
No, don't say that, all right?
You're gonna be all right.

882
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:35,034
&nbsp

883
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,935
Hey, I'm begging you, I'm begging you!

884
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:36,960
&nbsp

885
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,970
- I'm beg...
- Barry?

886
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:38,995
&nbsp

887
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,695
You lose, Barry.

888
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:41,720
&nbsp

889
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,798
No!

890
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:43,932
&nbsp

891
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,310
No!

892
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:54,110
&nbsp

893
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,853
Iris?

894
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:56,516
&nbsp

895
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,462
Iris, Iris.

896
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:07,434
&nbsp

897
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:08,935
Look.

898
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:12,639
&nbsp

899
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,071
Come on.

900
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:17,391
&nbsp

901
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,766
What... what'd you see?

902
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:18,791
&nbsp

903
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,040
Was it good? Did that... did that help?

904
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,848
&nbsp

905
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,214
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

906
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:23,216
&nbsp

907
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:24,696
It helped a lot.

908
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,018
&nbsp

909
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,284
Wally...

910
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:29,648
&nbsp

911
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,782
Why does nobody ever listen to me?

912
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:32,633
&nbsp

913
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,425
You're so full of it.

914
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,015
&nbsp

915
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,918
- What?
- Railing at me

916
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:36,943
&nbsp

917
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:39,077
for not telling everyone about Savitar?

918
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:39,166
&nbsp

919
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,844
What about what you're not
telling everyone, Barry?

920
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:41,869
&nbsp

921
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,906
- What are you...
- Cisco vibed me...

922
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:43,931
&nbsp

923
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:46,234
into the future. I saw what happened.

924
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:46,740
&nbsp

925
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,641
Tell my sister why you
asked her to marry you.

926
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,411
&nbsp

927
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:54,538
Go on, tell her the real reason, Barry.

928
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,926
&nbsp

929
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,059
What is he talking about?

930
00:19:59,069 --> 00:19:59,085
&nbsp

931
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,882
Barry.

932
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:04,410
&nbsp

933
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,244
The night that Savitar kills you,

934
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:07,269
&nbsp

935
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,770
you didn't have a ring on your finger.

936
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,820
&nbsp

937
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,853
We weren't engaged yet.

938
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,124
&nbsp

939
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,241
So you thought that if we were...

940
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:20,594
&nbsp

941
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,726
That it might change the future.

942
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,198
&nbsp

943
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,534
Iris...

944
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:25,745
&nbsp

945
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,232
Iris, wait.

946
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:30,404
&nbsp

947
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:32,137
Iris, hey. Come on.

948
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:32,139
&nbsp

949
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,120
Hey, hey, I love you, okay?

950
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,145
&nbsp

951
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,524
I love you more than anything.

952
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:35,549
&nbsp

953
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,049
That part has never
changed. It never will.

954
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:38,712
&nbsp

955
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:41,975
Barry, we moved in together
after some rash decision

956
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:42,000
&nbsp

957
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,215
that you made at Christmas,

958
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:43,217
&nbsp

959
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,983
and then a couple weeks
later, you proposed.

960
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:44,985
&nbsp

961
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,685
You didn't even ask
for my dad's permission.

962
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:46,687
&nbsp

963
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:48,453
I know. I don't know...
I guess I got caught...

964
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:48,455
&nbsp

965
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,719
I got caught up in the moment. I...

966
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:51,133
&nbsp

967
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,710
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

968
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:53,735
&nbsp

969
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:56,665
- Iris, please...
- Barry, I just...

970
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:57,119
&nbsp

971
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:59,231
I need time to think.

972
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:09,343
&nbsp

973
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,769
Hey.

974
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:15,182
&nbsp

975
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,381
You okay?

976
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:16,383
&nbsp

977
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,582
I'm worried.

978
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:17,584
&nbsp

979
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:19,618
Yeah, I understand.

980
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:19,620
&nbsp

981
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,621
I keep coming back
to the thought that...

982
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:22,623
&nbsp

983
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,090
I could be the cause of all this.

984
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,092
&nbsp

985
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,258
What do you mean?

986
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:26,260
&nbsp

987
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,660
Savitar's prophecy.

988
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:28,662
&nbsp

989
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,441
"One will betray you"

990
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:30,497
&nbsp

991
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:33,969
You may well have invited
Judas into the group, Caitlin.

992
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:33,994
&nbsp

993
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,367
It's not you.

994
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:35,369
&nbsp

995
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,213
It's impossible to tell.

996
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:37,238
&nbsp

997
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:39,004
Savitar could be controlling me,

998
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:39,006
&nbsp

999
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:41,173
and none of us would know about it.

1000
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:41,175
&nbsp

1001
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:42,440
None of us, not even me.

1002
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:42,442
&nbsp

1003
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,627
But this time, we know who it is.

1004
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,212
&nbsp

1005
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,545
How?

1006
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,176
&nbsp

1007
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,713
Because...

1008
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:52,152
&nbsp

1009
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:54,119
I'm the one who betrayed everyone.

1010
00:21:54,129 --> 00:22:01,698
&nbsp

1011
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,588
How long have you had this?

1012
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:04,624
&nbsp

1013
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:07,826
Ever since you threw the
box into the Speed Force.

1014
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:08,406
&nbsp

1015
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,805
It's such a small piece.

1016
00:22:09,815 --> 00:22:09,830
&nbsp

1017
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,763
I didn't think it would really matter.

1018
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,609
&nbsp

1019
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,308
Why would you even risk it?

1020
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:15,499
&nbsp

1021
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,893
Because...

1022
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:16,895
&nbsp

1023
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:20,218
I thought I could use it
to get rid of my powers.

1024
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:20,499
&nbsp

1025
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,099
And... can you?

1026
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:23,350
&nbsp

1027
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,318
I don't know. I haven't been able
to figure out how to use it yet.

1028
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:26,343
&nbsp

1029
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:28,009
Okay, well, look, gang,
I think we can all agree

1030
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:28,011
&nbsp

1031
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:30,052
that this is a simple
case of the other side...

1032
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:30,077
&nbsp

1033
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,866
Killer Frost side of Caitlin
clouding her better judgment, so...

1034
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:33,891
&nbsp

1035
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:36,108
No, H.R. This wasn't her.

1036
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:36,133
&nbsp

1037
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:37,599
It was me.

1038
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:38,414
&nbsp

1039
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,343
I'm really sorry, guys.

1040
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:41,558
&nbsp

1041
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,758
Right now, we just need to
figure out where Savitar is.

1042
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:43,760
&nbsp

1043
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,795
Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.

1044
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:46,797
&nbsp

1045
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:48,377
How are we gonna do that?

1046
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:49,566
&nbsp

1047
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,099
Uh...

1048
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:51,101
&nbsp

1049
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:52,367
- No.
- One more time.

1050
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:52,369
&nbsp

1051
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,181
- No.
- No, no.

1052
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:54,206
&nbsp

1053
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:55,672
You want to summon Savitar again?

1054
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:55,674
&nbsp

1055
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,474
I am not a human Ouija board, Barry.

1056
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:57,476
&nbsp

1057
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:59,185
- You can't just keep...
- It's the last time, all right?

1058
00:22:59,195 --> 00:22:59,210
&nbsp

1059
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,326
And only long enough to see

1060
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:00,351
&nbsp

1061
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:01,883
if maybe we can track his location.

1062
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:01,908
&nbsp

1063
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,529
- Is that possible?
- No. No.

1064
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,118
&nbsp

1065
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:09,668
Julian, we gotta end
this, for everybody's sake.

1066
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:14,754
&nbsp

1067
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,987
- I'll see you downstairs.
- Oh...

1068
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:17,012
&nbsp

1069
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,328
Okay, well, you guys can
count me out, all right?

1070
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:18,330
&nbsp

1071
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,473
'Cause I didn't bring an endless
supply of boxers to this planet.

1072
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:21,564
&nbsp

1073
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:25,005
Julian, please.

1074
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:25,658
&nbsp

1075
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:27,660
I should have told you.

1076
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,687
&nbsp

1077
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:32,688
I can't believe that you
would keep part of that Stone.

1078
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:32,713
&nbsp

1079
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,793
Do you not remember what
Savitar had me do with that?

1080
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:34,818
&nbsp

1081
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:35,910
Yes, I do.

1082
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:35,935
&nbsp

1083
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,768
But you're not concerned, are you?

1084
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:37,793
&nbsp

1085
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:40,561
You just want your own
personal meta-human specialist

1086
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:40,586
&nbsp

1087
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:41,985
to try and find you a cure.

1088
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:41,987
&nbsp

1089
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:43,808
Julian, I don't want these powers.

1090
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:43,833
&nbsp

1091
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:46,027
I can't spend the rest
of my life wondering

1092
00:23:46,037 --> 00:23:46,052
&nbsp

1093
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,746
if or when I'm gonna lose this battle

1094
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:48,771
&nbsp

1095
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,504
and become Killer Frost.

1096
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,961
&nbsp

1097
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,205
I thought you more than
anyone would understand that.

1098
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:55,230
&nbsp

1099
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,338
You know... you know what I understand?

1100
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:57,423
&nbsp

1101
00:23:57,433 --> 00:24:00,150
I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

1102
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,175
&nbsp

1103
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:01,908
That's not the only reason.

1104
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:02,769
&nbsp

1105
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,136
Yeah, I wish I could believe that.

1106
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:16,677
&nbsp

1107
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,109
Dad.

1108
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,331
&nbsp

1109
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,889
I heard what happened.

1110
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:20,440
&nbsp

1111
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,307
Thought you might need a pick-me-up.

1112
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:23,309
&nbsp

1113
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,209
Worked like a charm when you were a kid.

1114
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:25,211
&nbsp

1115
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,959
Smaller problems.

1116
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,389
&nbsp

1117
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,782
Yeah.

1118
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:37,223
&nbsp

1119
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,844
So...

1120
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,877
&nbsp

1121
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:43,361
- you wanna talk about it?
- I don't know what I want, Dad.

1122
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:43,363
&nbsp

1123
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:44,929
Iris...

1124
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:44,931
&nbsp

1125
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,532
whatever you may be feeling
right now about Barry,

1126
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:47,534
&nbsp

1127
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:50,412
that man does love you.

1128
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,204
&nbsp

1129
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:54,639
That... that kind of love is rare.

1130
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:54,641
&nbsp

1131
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,708
Dad, I wish it were that simple.

1132
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:56,710
&nbsp

1133
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,810
Simple.

1134
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:58,812
&nbsp

1135
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:02,155
Look, only you know...

1136
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:02,180
&nbsp

1137
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,981
what's good for you.

1138
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:04,006
&nbsp

1139
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,780
But with the kind of lives...

1140
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:06,805
&nbsp

1141
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:09,654
that you two have,

1142
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:09,656
&nbsp

1143
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,156
that love between the two of you,

1144
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:12,181
&nbsp

1145
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,242
that is the one thing...

1146
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:15,267
&nbsp

1147
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:17,338
that should stay simple.

1148
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:21,602
&nbsp

1149
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,602
Baby girl.

1150
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:26,139
&nbsp

1151
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,206
We'll be here if you need anything.

1152
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:28,208
&nbsp

1153
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,900
Okay.

1154
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,711
&nbsp

1155
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,778
Back to worship me once again?

1156
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:35,882
&nbsp

1157
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:38,249
We just wanted to let you know
that we're gonna defeat you.

1158
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:38,251
&nbsp

1159
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:39,684
Unlikely.

1160
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:39,686
&nbsp

1161
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:42,887
You told us that you're trapped,
imprisoned for all eternity.

1162
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:42,912
&nbsp

1163
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:46,267
You're never getting out of wherever
my future self locked you up.

1164
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:46,292
&nbsp

1165
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:48,612
You'll never know freedom again.

1166
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:49,363
&nbsp

1167
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:53,096
All will be revealed soon, Flash.

1168
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:53,428
&nbsp

1169
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:55,728
You will face my wrath.

1170
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:55,753
&nbsp

1171
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,659
You will beg for mercy,

1172
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,684
&nbsp

1173
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,704
and you will get none.

1174
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:05,078
&nbsp

1175
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:06,711
- Did it work?
- Did it work?

1176
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:06,713
&nbsp

1177
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:08,692
Yeah. We got a hit.

1178
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:08,993
&nbsp

1179
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:12,460
It's just that that hit
is all of Central City.

1180
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,485
&nbsp

1181
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,951
That's not a hit. The whole city?

1182
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:13,953
&nbsp

1183
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,753
- Yeah.
- God. Well...

1184
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:15,755
&nbsp

1185
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:17,221
can we get a little more specific?

1186
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:17,223
&nbsp

1187
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,056
Pinpoint a location at
least... uh, something?

1188
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:19,058
&nbsp

1189
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,058
I think maybe we can get
a little bit more precise,

1190
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:21,060
&nbsp

1191
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,794
but I'm gonna have to give
it the old meta-human try.

1192
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:22,796
&nbsp

1193
00:26:22,806 --> 00:26:23,961
Okay.

1194
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:23,963
&nbsp

1195
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,631
It's Iris. All right.
I'll be right back, but...

1196
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:26,633
&nbsp

1197
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,699
just let me know if you
get anything, all right?

1198
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:28,724
&nbsp

1199
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,097
All right.

1200
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:44,951
&nbsp

1201
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,292
Hey.

1202
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:49,055
&nbsp

1203
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,755
You going somewhere?

1204
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:50,757
&nbsp

1205
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:54,214
Yeah, I just wanna get back
to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.

1206
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:54,561
&nbsp

1207
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,662
Seeing as how you exploded
on Barry in front of everyone,

1208
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:57,664
&nbsp

1209
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:59,130
might want to wait on it.

1210
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,132
&nbsp

1211
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:02,166
Well, the truth had to come out, so...

1212
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:02,168
&nbsp

1213
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,985
Yeah, it did.

1214
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:04,610
&nbsp

1215
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,537
Just maybe not that way.

1216
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:06,940
&nbsp

1217
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,574
I mean, we all have to help each other,

1218
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:09,576
&nbsp

1219
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,342
not point fingers.

1220
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:12,745
&nbsp

1221
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,580
You're right. I...

1222
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,248
&nbsp

1223
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,669
I'll make it up to them. It's just,

1224
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:16,694
&nbsp

1225
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,461
this whole thing is
messing with my head.

1226
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,708
&nbsp

1227
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:22,286
- Don't let it.
- You don't get it, Jesse.

1228
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:22,288
&nbsp

1229
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:23,821
When you got your powers,

1230
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:23,823
&nbsp

1231
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,489
you were walking down the street.

1232
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:25,491
&nbsp

1233
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,411
Me? I touched the Philosopher's Stone,

1234
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:27,436
&nbsp

1235
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,996
I got trapped in some cocoon, and...

1236
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:30,021
&nbsp

1237
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:33,764
I just feel, because
of all of that, I...

1238
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:33,766
&nbsp

1239
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,600
there's something wrong with me.

1240
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:35,602
&nbsp

1241
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,571
I feel like Savitar has some kind of...

1242
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:38,658
&nbsp

1243
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,490
hold on me.

1244
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,202
&nbsp

1245
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:44,075
Look, I know.

1246
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:44,077
&nbsp

1247
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:47,116
Okay? But you're strong, Wally.

1248
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:47,347
&nbsp

1249
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,913
You can fight this.

1250
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:48,915
&nbsp

1251
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:52,719
You know, all I ever
wanted was to have powers.

1252
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:53,119
&nbsp

1253
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,752
To do some good.

1254
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:54,754
&nbsp

1255
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:57,421
But now, now I'm...
I'm the one responsible

1256
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:57,423
&nbsp

1257
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,724
for saving Iris' life.

1258
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:01,218
&nbsp

1259
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:04,061
I don't know if I'm gonna be
fast enough to save her, so...

1260
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:04,063
&nbsp

1261
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:06,430
Okay, Wally. You're not alone.

1262
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,400
&nbsp

1263
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,799
Okay.

1264
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,770
&nbsp

1265
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,969
She's right, Wally.

1266
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,907
&nbsp

1267
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,239
You're not alone.

1268
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:18,077
&nbsp

1269
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,410
Mom.

1270
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,366
&nbsp

1271
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,466
You're never alone, Wally.

1272
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:30,764
&nbsp

1273
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:33,684
- I've missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

1274
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:33,709
&nbsp

1275
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,242
Wally?

1276
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:40,158
&nbsp

1277
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,992
I'm so proud of you.

1278
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:42,994
&nbsp

1279
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,867
Of what you're trying to become.

1280
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:44,892
&nbsp

1281
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:46,258
That's all I want.

1282
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:46,260
&nbsp

1283
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,962
I just want you to be proud of me.

1284
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:49,096
&nbsp

1285
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,230
Wally, you're really freaking me out.

1286
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,232
&nbsp

1287
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:54,867
I am, son. I'm so very, very proud.

1288
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:54,869
&nbsp

1289
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:56,923
But you have to stop.

1290
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:57,731
&nbsp

1291
00:28:57,741 --> 00:28:59,597
What? Why?

1292
00:28:59,607 --> 00:28:59,622
&nbsp

1293
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,689
You're working so hard.

1294
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:01,714
&nbsp

1295
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:05,716
You don't see how dangerous it is.

1296
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:05,813
&nbsp

1297
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:09,343
Son, you're not fast enough.

1298
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:09,650
&nbsp

1299
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,483
You never will be.

1300
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:12,285
&nbsp

1301
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:15,476
But I can't... I can't
stop. I have to save Iris.

1302
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:15,522
&nbsp

1303
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:17,723
- I have to.
- Wally.

1304
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:24,031
&nbsp

1305
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,272
You're in my head again.

1306
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:27,244
&nbsp

1307
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:30,045
You were always so smart.

1308
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:30,204
&nbsp

1309
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,233
Weren't you, Wallace?

1310
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:32,258
&nbsp

1311
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:34,258
But not smart enough.

1312
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:34,283
&nbsp

1313
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:37,984
I have what I need to
escape my hell, Wallace.

1314
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:38,078
&nbsp

1315
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,478
No, not everything.

1316
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:39,480
&nbsp

1317
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,780
We still have a piece of that Stone.

1318
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:41,782
&nbsp

1319
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,315
Not for long.

1320
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:43,317
&nbsp

1321
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,960
And once I have it,

1322
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:44,985
&nbsp

1323
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:47,552
you and everyone you love

1324
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:47,554
&nbsp

1325
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:49,254
will perish.

1326
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:50,389
&nbsp

1327
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,155
- Wally?
- I have to go.

1328
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,180
&nbsp

1329
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,425
I can't let him get out.

1330
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:53,450
&nbsp

1331
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,137
- What are you talking about?
- Savitar.

1332
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:55,162
&nbsp

1333
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,545
- You need to tell Barry, okay?
- No. I can do this by myself.

1334
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:57,570
&nbsp

1335
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,514
Jesse, please, just wait here.

1336
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:14,782
&nbsp

1337
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,748
- Hey.
- Hey.

1338
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:18,081
&nbsp

1339
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,002
I got your message.

1340
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:20,027
&nbsp

1341
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:22,587
Yeah. Come, sit down.

1342
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:26,694
&nbsp

1343
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:28,600
Iris, uh...

1344
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,496
&nbsp

1345
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:32,771
- I know you're mad, but...
- No, Barry, that's not it.

1346
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,306
&nbsp

1347
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,865
I just want you to listen. Okay?

1348
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,171
&nbsp

1349
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,292
I need you to...

1350
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:39,317
&nbsp

1351
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,831
let me say what I need to say.

1352
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:42,455
&nbsp

1353
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,073
Okay.

1354
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,312
&nbsp

1355
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:48,113
I'm not angry... at you.

1356
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:48,115
&nbsp

1357
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,582
I understand that you...

1358
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:50,584
&nbsp

1359
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,034
you want to keep me safe,

1360
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:52,059
&nbsp

1361
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:54,527
and us getting engaged
could change the future.

1362
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:54,552
&nbsp

1363
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,855
I... I get all of that.

1364
00:30:56,865 --> 00:31:01,061
&nbsp

1365
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,659
Barry, when you proposed to me...

1366
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:04,164
&nbsp

1367
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,698
I said yes because...

1368
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,569
&nbsp

1369
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,336
I love you more than anything.

1370
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:11,338
&nbsp

1371
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:13,338
And I want to be your wife.

1372
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,611
&nbsp

1373
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,410
But I thought that you were
asking me purely out of love,

1374
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,412
&nbsp

1375
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:20,178
not fear.

1376
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:20,180
&nbsp

1377
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,847
And, Barry, whether
you realize it or not,

1378
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:21,872
&nbsp

1379
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:25,128
now there's always gonna be
a part of us that's tainted.

1380
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:26,228
&nbsp

1381
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:28,220
Iris, I'm trying to save your life.

1382
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,222
&nbsp

1383
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,522
I know, and that's the problem.

1384
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:32,593
&nbsp

1385
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,993
I want to be your wife, Barry.

1386
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:34,995
&nbsp

1387
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,661
I don't want to be...

1388
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:36,663
&nbsp

1389
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:38,697
someone that you're trying to save

1390
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:38,699
&nbsp

1391
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,629
for the rest of eternity.

1392
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:46,874
&nbsp

1393
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:48,273
Eternity.

1394
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:57,217
&nbsp

1395
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:58,750
- Can't see anything.
- Give me those.

1396
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:58,752
&nbsp

1397
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:00,385
- Are those things even working?
- Yep.

1398
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:00,387
&nbsp

1399
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:01,738
Stop it!

1400
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:01,763
&nbsp

1401
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:03,472
- I just wanna see if they're working.
- What are you doing?

1402
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:03,497
&nbsp

1403
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:06,301
- What do you see?
- I'm seeing these white...

1404
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:06,326
&nbsp

1405
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:07,784
- flashes, it's like...
- Flashes?

1406
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:07,809
&nbsp

1407
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:10,538
Yeah, it's like Savitar
speeding through, like, a storm.

1408
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:10,563
&nbsp

1409
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:12,276
No, it's not a storm.

1410
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:12,301
&nbsp

1411
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,886
It's the Speed Force.

1412
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:15,869
&nbsp

1413
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,205
He's in the Speed Force.

1414
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:17,230
&nbsp

1415
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,138
That's why only speedsters
were able to see him.

1416
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:20,140
&nbsp

1417
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,908
Why is Savitar hiding
in the Speed Force?

1418
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:22,910
&nbsp

1419
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,650
He's not hiding.

1420
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:24,675
&nbsp

1421
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,445
That's where the future you trapped him.

1422
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:26,447
&nbsp

1423
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:27,712
That's right.

1424
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:27,714
&nbsp

1425
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:30,227
And that's why Savitar only
appears for a few moments at a time,

1426
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:30,252
&nbsp

1427
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:33,211
because the Speed Force just sucks
him back in. That makes sense.

1428
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:33,236
&nbsp

1429
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:36,350
But we threw the Philosopher's
Stone into the Speed Force.

1430
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,375
&nbsp

1431
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:38,690
And we gave him the very
thing he needed to escape.

1432
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:38,692
&nbsp

1433
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:41,623
Except, he said he
still needed one thing.

1434
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:42,096
&nbsp

1435
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:43,232
I don't think he can come out

1436
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:43,257
&nbsp

1437
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,873
because he doesn't have the whole Stone.

1438
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:48,664
&nbsp

1439
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,781
Guys... Wally went after Savitar.

1440
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:50,806
&nbsp

1441
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:51,814
- What?
- What?

1442
00:32:51,824 --> 00:32:51,839
&nbsp

1443
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,205
He started hallucinating.

1444
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:53,207
&nbsp

1445
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:55,073
He thought he was talking to his mom.

1446
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:55,075
&nbsp

1447
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,242
No, that's... that's
not her. That's Savitar.

1448
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:57,244
&nbsp

1449
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:58,877
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1450
00:32:58,887 --> 00:32:58,879
&nbsp

1451
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,458
Okay. He was freaking
out. He said that...

1452
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:00,483
&nbsp

1453
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,544
he needed to stop
Savitar from getting out,

1454
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:02,569
&nbsp

1455
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,247
and he sped off.

1456
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,369
&nbsp

1457
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:06,768
The Stone.

1458
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,420
&nbsp

1459
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,919
- It's gone?
- It's gone.

1460
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:12,944
&nbsp

1461
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,771
- Barry, we gotta find Wally.
- Yeah.

1462
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:14,796
&nbsp

1463
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,261
If Savitar gets ahold
of the Stone, then...

1464
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:16,263
&nbsp

1465
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:17,999
He'll escape for sure.

1466
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:18,065
&nbsp

1467
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,365
I can't find him. He turned
off the suit's telemetry.

1468
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:25,539
&nbsp

1469
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:26,938
Oh, come on!

1470
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,796
&nbsp

1471
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,474
Poor Wallace.

1472
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:30,499
&nbsp

1473
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,577
Can't even open a portal.

1474
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:32,579
&nbsp

1475
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:36,523
You can't get rid of
that Stone, Wallace.

1476
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:36,585
&nbsp

1477
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:39,518
Like you can't get rid of me.

1478
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:39,520
&nbsp

1479
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,562
Oh, shut up, shut up.

1480
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:41,922
&nbsp

1481
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,688
You know it's true.

1482
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:43,690
&nbsp

1483
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,558
You're not fast enough to
throw it into the Speed Force

1484
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:46,560
&nbsp

1485
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,007
by yourself.

1486
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:48,032
&nbsp

1487
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,491
Shut up!

1488
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:51,182
&nbsp

1489
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,616
I'm going to get out of here, Wallace.

1490
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:53,641
&nbsp

1491
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:55,708
And then I'm gonna come for you...

1492
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:55,733
&nbsp

1493
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,400
and Barry and your sister,

1494
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:58,425
&nbsp

1495
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:01,059
and I'll kill everyone you love.

1496
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:01,084
&nbsp

1497
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:02,517
No, you're not real!

1498
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:02,542
&nbsp

1499
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:04,342
You're just in my head, just...

1500
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:04,378
&nbsp

1501
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,511
Oh, I'm real,

1502
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:06,513
&nbsp

1503
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,781
and I know the limits of your speed.

1504
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:09,783
&nbsp

1505
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:13,427
After all, I'm the
one who gave it to you.

1506
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:13,452
&nbsp

1507
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:14,981
And that...

1508
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:15,689
&nbsp

1509
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,723
giving me speed...

1510
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:17,925
&nbsp

1511
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,091
that was your biggest mistake.

1512
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:35,108
&nbsp

1513
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:36,847
- There's a massive power surge.
- Where?

1514
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:36,872
&nbsp

1515
00:34:36,882 --> 00:34:38,269
The old Kob Factory.

1516
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,074
&nbsp

1517
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:42,044
Pulling up security footage.

1518
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:42,388
&nbsp

1519
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:43,782
Oh, my God.

1520
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,853
&nbsp

1521
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:48,161
Wally.

1522
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,075
&nbsp

1523
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,791
No!

1524
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:52,793
&nbsp

1525
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:54,723
Aah!

1526
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:55,430
&nbsp

1527
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,230
No!

1528
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,412
&nbsp

1529
00:34:57,422 --> 00:34:59,779
No! Help me, Barry!

1530
00:34:59,789 --> 00:34:59,804
&nbsp

1531
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,266
Aah!

1532
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:35,035
&nbsp

1533
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:37,963
I am free!

1534
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:45,324
&nbsp

1535
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,253
Ground.

1536
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:47,278
&nbsp

1537
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:49,230
Air...

1538
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,461
&nbsp

1539
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:51,371
I can feel again.

1540
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:51,396
&nbsp

1541
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:53,456
I can breathe again.

1542
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:53,751
&nbsp

1543
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,519
I've beaten you, finally.

1544
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:56,698
&nbsp

1545
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,370
Where's Wally?

1546
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,671
&nbsp

1547
00:35:58,681 --> 00:35:59,937
What just happened to him?

1548
00:35:59,947 --> 00:35:59,939
&nbsp

1549
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,540
Like the Greek myth of Atlas,

1550
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,565
&nbsp

1551
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:06,423
who could not put down the sky
until someone took his place,

1552
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:06,448
&nbsp

1553
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:10,423
Wally has taken my
place in the Speed Force.

1554
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:10,448
&nbsp

1555
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,378
You know me. I love a good myth.

1556
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:14,433
&nbsp

1557
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,219
He took your place. What...

1558
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:16,221
&nbsp

1559
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,488
When you created Flashpoint,

1560
00:36:18,498 --> 00:36:18,490
&nbsp

1561
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,837
you unwittingly provided me
with the means for my return.

1562
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:22,862
&nbsp

1563
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:24,094
Wally...

1564
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:24,096
&nbsp

1565
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:27,003
You gave me the idea to turn Wally

1566
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:27,028
&nbsp

1567
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:28,908
into Kid Flash,

1568
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:28,933
&nbsp

1569
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,211
to make him fast enough to replace me

1570
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:31,236
&nbsp

1571
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:32,978
in your prison.

1572
00:36:32,988 --> 00:36:33,003
&nbsp

1573
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,847
His youth and ego were my allies.

1574
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:35,872
&nbsp

1575
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:38,487
So taken with his fame and speed,

1576
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:38,512
&nbsp

1577
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:42,355
he never saw he was
running right into my trap.

1578
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:42,380
&nbsp

1579
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,128
How do I get him out?

1580
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:44,130
&nbsp

1581
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,463
- Wally's gone.
- How do I get him out?

1582
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:46,465
&nbsp

1583
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:50,622
Suffering in an endless
void for all eternity.

1584
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:50,654
&nbsp

1585
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:54,996
Another victim Barry
Allen failed to save.

1586
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:55,304
&nbsp

1587
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,794
No!

1588
00:36:56,804 --> 00:37:10,084
&nbsp

1589
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,483
I'm gonna kill you!

1590
00:37:11,493 --> 00:37:11,508
&nbsp

1591
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:13,991
If you had the strength to end my life,

1592
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:13,993
&nbsp

1593
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:16,227
you would have done it in the future.

1594
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:16,252
&nbsp

1595
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:18,515
But Barry Allen doesn't kill.

1596
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:18,540
&nbsp

1597
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,064
He's the good guy.

1598
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:20,066
&nbsp

1599
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:24,037
The boy Joe raised. The man Iris loves.

1600
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:24,062
&nbsp

1601
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,069
You have everything.

1602
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,094
&nbsp

1603
00:37:26,104 --> 00:37:28,094
And deserve none of it.

1604
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:31,577
&nbsp

1605
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:35,412
I'm going to destroy this
city like I did in the future,

1606
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:35,414
&nbsp

1607
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,660
so you can see the truth, Barry.

1608
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,685
&nbsp

1609
00:37:37,695 --> 00:37:42,176
And then, you'll treat me like a god.

1610
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:42,201
&nbsp

1611
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,192
You're not a god!

1612
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:50,115
&nbsp

1613
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,117
Who are you?

1614
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:51,142
&nbsp

1615
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:54,408
I am the future, Flash.

1616
00:37:54,418 --> 00:38:04,097
&nbsp

1617
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,068
Show your face.

1618
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,990
&nbsp

1619
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,849
I want so badly to kill you,

1620
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:11,851
&nbsp

1621
00:38:11,861 --> 00:38:13,177
and I will.

1622
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:13,207
&nbsp

1623
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:15,674
But you have to live
a little while longer.

1624
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:15,699
&nbsp

1625
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,666
Long enough to see Iris die.

1626
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:27,780
&nbsp

1627
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,121
The blade didn't hit your organs,

1628
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:29,146
&nbsp

1629
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,445
but it did shatter your clavicle.

1630
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:30,470
&nbsp

1631
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,801
Hang in there, man, hang in there.

1632
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:31,826
&nbsp

1633
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:33,404
- We have to take it out.
- Do it!

1634
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:33,406
&nbsp

1635
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,676
Any medicine I give you your
metabolism will burn through.

1636
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:35,701
&nbsp

1637
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,274
All right. Just do it, okay?

1638
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:37,276
&nbsp

1639
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:38,742
- Just do it.
- Hold him down.

1640
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:38,744
&nbsp

1641
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:40,417
Okay. Gonna be okay,
mate. You're gonna be okay.

1642
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:40,442
&nbsp

1643
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,817
Bite down on this.

1644
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:42,552
&nbsp

1645
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:44,223
I'm so sorry.

1646
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:44,248
&nbsp

1647
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:46,749
Three, two, one.

1648
00:38:46,759 --> 00:39:01,200
&nbsp

1649
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,948
- How long was I out?
- Not long.

1650
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:04,206
&nbsp

1651
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,190
Are you in much pain?

1652
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:17,783
&nbsp

1653
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:20,349
I might be able to do
something with this.

1654
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,455
&nbsp

1655
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:24,821
Joe.

1656
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:25,057
&nbsp

1657
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:26,677
I'm sorry.

1658
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:27,226
&nbsp

1659
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:28,513
I'm sorry.

1660
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:29,093
&nbsp

1661
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,659
Not your fault.

1662
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,999
&nbsp

1663
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,616
Where is he?

1664
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:34,837
&nbsp

1665
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,702
I mean, is he in pain? Is he...

1666
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:42,942
&nbsp

1667
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:45,526
"One will suffer a
fate worse than death."

1668
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:55,654
&nbsp

1669
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,401
Jesse,

1670
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:57,589
&nbsp

1671
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,009
I...

1672
00:39:59,019 --> 00:39:59,525
&nbsp

1673
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,925
I'm not like your dad. I don't really...

1674
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:01,927
&nbsp

1675
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:03,527
know what the right words are...

1676
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:08,601
&nbsp

1677
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:10,542
What are we gonna do?

1678
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:11,612
&nbsp

1679
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,362
We have to bring him back.
We have to save him...

1680
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:14,840
&nbsp

1681
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,241
I can't lose Wally, Barry.

1682
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:22,930
&nbsp

1683
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,296
I'm sorry.

1684
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:41,449
&nbsp

1685
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,994
I'm gonna work on this.

1686
00:40:44,004 --> 00:40:44,670
&nbsp

1687
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,923
Yeah.

1688
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:46,699
&nbsp

1689
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,330
I'll see you soon.

1690
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:54,173
&nbsp

1691
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:55,873
I'm sorry.

1692
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:56,330
&nbsp

1693
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,486
I should have never...

1694
00:40:58,496 --> 00:40:58,617
&nbsp

1695
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,869
- I was afraid.
- I know.

1696
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:01,475
&nbsp

1697
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:03,442
Believe me, I know.

1698
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:05,124
&nbsp

1699
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:08,158
Fear makes us do a lot of
things that we shouldn't.

1700
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:12,331
&nbsp

1701
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,832
My fear's the reason for all of this.
