1
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,409
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,744
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,581
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,333
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,880
That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending--

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,178
Who are you?

7
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,435
You don't want any part of this.

8
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,638
Gone but not forgotten.

9
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,807
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

10
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,934
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

11
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,605
-This year has been nothing short of--
-**** is crazy. It's insane.

12
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,606
-Jason.
-What?

13
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,983
No swearing.

14
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,818
It's the last day of school. We're good.

15
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:14,945
Historic.

16
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,532
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

17
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,828
including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.

18
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,539
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

19
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,623
brought us back.

20
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,586
They called it "the Blip."

21
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,255
Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...

22
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,926
But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.

23
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,014
-My little brother is now older than me.
-Yeah, it's math.

24
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,142
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

25
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,436
and had already taken midterms,

26
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,189
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.

27
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,940
It's totally unfair.

28
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,150
It's not right.

29
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,155
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

30
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,699
As we draw this year to a close,

31
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,993
it's time to move on...

32
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,164
-to a new phase of our lives.
-Pray nothing crazy happens again

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,333
because are the Avengers even
a thing anymore?

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,336
-Does anyone even have a plan?
-I have a plan.

35
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,755
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

36
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,466
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual-headphone adapter

37
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,259
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

38
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,470
-Okay.
-Three, when we go to Venice--

39
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,430
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

40
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,806
-True.
-So I'm gonna buy her

41
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,976
a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia

42
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,478
-because of, well...
-The murder.

43
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,438
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

44
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,815
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

45
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,484
give her the necklace.

46
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,444
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

47
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,907
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,325
Oh, don't forget step seven.

49
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,410
-Step seven?
-Don't do any of that.

50
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,706
-Why?
-We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.

51
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,707
-Ned.
-Look,

52
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,168
I may not know much, but I do know this:

53
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,629
Europeans love Americans.

54
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,507
-Really?
-More than half of them are women.

55
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,175
Okay. Sure.

56
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,178
But I really like MJ, man, okay?

57
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,014
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

58
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,767
Sometimes I catch her looking at me,
I feel like I've stood up--

59
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,853
-She's coming. Don't say anything.
-What up, dorks?

60
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,773
-Excited about the science trip?
-Hey, we're talking about the trip.

61
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,317
-Yeah, and Peter's plan.
-You have a plan?

62
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,320
I don't-- I don't have a plan.

63
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,033
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

64
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,618
Like a grandmother?

65
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,038
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

66
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,665
Oh, okay, well...

67
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,419
that was a real roller coaster.

68
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,545
By the way, travel tip:

69
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,714
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

70
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,133
so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.

71
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,719
Smart. Will do.

72
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,894
Dude, I think that went really great.

73
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,273
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

74
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,318
the family that was living there
was very confused.

75
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,070
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

76
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:06,283
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was-- It was really a mess.

77
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,951
Thank you for coming out

78
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,537
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

79
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,416
And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!

80
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,263
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

81
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,807
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

82
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,645
And thank you, Spider-Man.

83
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,732
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!

84
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,532
-That was amazing.
-That was great.

85
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,077
-That was so cool. I was so nervous.
-I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,121
-I thought you did great.
-You were a little stiff.

87
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,749
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

88
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,209
-It's fine, it's fine.
-Okay.

89
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,710
-Did you get your passport?
-Yeah.

90
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,045
-Mini toothpaste?
-Yeah, I did.

91
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,131
Hey, sorry I'm late.

92
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,552
-Happy. Hey.
-Oh, you look lovely.

93
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,595
-Thanks. You too.
-Thank you.

94
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,722
-New dress?
-Yeah, yes, it is.

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,101
-It's a new beard.
-It's my-- My Blip beard.

96
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,853
I grew it in the Blip.

97
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,646
It's a Blip beard.

98
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,939
I see. Yeah.

99
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,359
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced at the office.

100
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,529
Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.

101
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,115
The amount's nice too. They're generous.

102
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,659
-Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here.
-Yeah. Thank you.

103
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,247
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.

104
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,208
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

105
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,960
Will do.

106
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,716
What just happened?

107
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,802
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

108
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,888
-Fury's gonna call me? Why?
-Yeah.

109
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,765
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

110
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,934
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

111
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,354
If it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

112
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,565
Apparently not.

113
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,530
-No caller ID. That's him.
-I don't wanna talk to Fury.

114
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,615
-Answer the phone.
-Why?

115
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,992
If you don't talk to him, I have to,
and I don't want to.

116
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,286
-Why not?
-Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.

117
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,664
-You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
-Yeah.

118
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,501
-You don't send Fury to voicemail.
-Hear that? They're calling me.

119
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,252
-I gotta go.
-You gotta talk to him.

120
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,922
I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

121
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,882
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

122
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,759
I promise you, I'll call him.

123
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,887
After my trip.

124
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,804
Hey!

125
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,017
Yeah, hi-- No, no, he's not ghosting you.

126
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,688
Okay, one question at a time.

127
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,149
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

128
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,651
No, I'm not.

129
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,903
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

130
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,530
If the aliens come back, what will you do?

131
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,990
Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?

132
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,409
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

133
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,328
What it is like to take over
from Tony Stark?

134
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,871
Those are some big shoes to fill.

135
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,295
I'm-- I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

136
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,087
Okay.

137
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,178
Hungry?

138
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,931
So sorry.

139
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,393
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

140
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,812
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

141
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,940
What's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

142
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,736
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

143
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,696
You deserve it.

144
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,033
Yeah.

145
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:17,868
You know what?

146
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,997
You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.

147
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,417
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

148
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,046
No.

149
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,095
No. No, I'm not.

150
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,395
-Yeah!
-Can you help me get my stuff up here?

151
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,648
-Oh, sorry, that's mine.
-No worries.

152
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,193
-Middle seat gets both armrests.
-Give me a tablet.

153
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,946
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

154
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,073
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

155
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,992
-I can't chaperone these kids alone.
-Yo, Parker.

156
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,037
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,541
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.

158
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,167
Ma'am?

159
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,963
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

160
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,214
I'll take that.

161
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,758
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

162
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,804
Classic MJ, right?

163
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,183
Did you know Brad was coming?

164
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,185
It-- It's so weird.

165
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,188
One day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

166
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,274
and suddenly, we Blip back,

167
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,986
and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.

168
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,406
-Not all the girls are after him.
-No, man, they're all after him.

169
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,782
Yeah. Here.

170
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,535
Anyway, on to more important things.

171
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,080
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play
Beast Slayers the whole time.

172
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,456
Are you excited?

173
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,168
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

174
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,880
-Seriously?
-Yes, seriously.

175
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,924
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

176
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,802
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

177
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,265
Please.

178
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,062
Hey, guys.

179
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:13,233
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

180
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:16,445
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

181
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,699
Betty, if you could switch seats with him,
that would be--

182
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,950
He's allergic to perfume?

183
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,037
Yeah, yeah, because it--

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,747
It makes his eyes water,

185
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,124
-and he can't really--
-Peter has a perfume allergy?

186
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,586
From experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

187
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,964
I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.

188
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,843
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

189
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,386
Peter, let's get you out of there.

190
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,305
-Sorry.
-Zach and Sebastian,

191
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,724
-you take Ned and Peter's seats.
-That's all right.

192
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,227
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

193
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,064
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

194
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,566
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

195
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,984
Let's go!

196
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,411
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

197
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,875
So did you want to play Beast Slayer?

198
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,793
Nope.

199
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,338
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or--?

200
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,924
-No.
-Got it.

201
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,426
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

202
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,639
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

203
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,182
We had a fake funeral for her.

204
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,352
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.

205
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,478
Wanna see the video?

206
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,481
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

207
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,067
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

208
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,112
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

209
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,782
Good afternoon,
this is your captain speaking.

210
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,703
Our flight time will be eight hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.

211
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,436
Nice picture.

212
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,939
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

213
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,316
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

214
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,984
Dude, don't worry, okay?

215
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,195
-I'm sure that's nothing.
-Hey, babe.

216
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,530
Can you hold this?

217
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,323
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

218
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,166
What was that?

219
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,587
Well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

220
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,172
we have a lot in common.

221
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,800
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

222
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,636
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

223
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,430
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

224
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,975
And that boy met a woman.

225
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,811
A very strong and powerful woman.

226
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,730
And now that boy's a man.

227
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,440
-Babe?
-Coming, babe.

228
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,115
There's nothing in there. I swear.

229
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,632
These, no.

230
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,518
Sorry. Sorry.

231
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,605
-I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
-Wait, wait, wait.

232
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,648
-I'm here, I'm here.
-Oh, thank goodness.

233
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:59,228
Looks like we're here.
They're doing renovations to the place.

234
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,855
-Getting some upgrades.
-Oh, this is trash.

235
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,398
-That must be the concierge.
-Okay.

236
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,608
Come on, man.

237
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,819
Everyone, here we are.

238
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,448
-Tell me we're not staying here.
-Come on in.

239
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,075
This place is sinking.

240
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,285
-You mean, "charming."
-It stinks.

241
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,746
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

242
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,624
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

243
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,792
-¡Vámonos!
-It's "andiamo."

244
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,086
-Andiamo!
-There you go.

245
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,753
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

246
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,798
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

247
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,806
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

248
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,766
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's--

249
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,395
-This is so much fun.
-Yeah?

250
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,920
-Three, two, one.
-Say "pizza."

251
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,256
-Pizza!
-Pizza time!

252
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,945
Hi.

253
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,530
I'm looking for a...

254
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,084
It's perfect.

255
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,762
What?

256
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,849
The most perfect word.
Italians created it, I just discovered it.

257
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,018
-What does it mean?
-It can mean a million things.

258
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,811
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."

259
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,813
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."

260
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,608
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.

261
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,361
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.

262
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,364
Hey. German? American.

263
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,907
A rose for you.

264
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,161
"Boh" is my new superpower.

265
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,830
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

266
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,416
So, what's in the bag?

267
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,171
Nice.

268
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,514
Whoa, cool.

269
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,323
What was that?

270
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,432
-Betty! You okay?
-Yeah.

271
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,893
-Oh, my God!
-Come on.

272
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,436
Guys, we gotta go!

273
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,649
-What is that?
-I don't know.

274
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,568
-What'll you do?
-Left my suit in the hotel.

275
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,528
-Why?
-I'm on vacation, Ned!

276
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,113
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out of here.

277
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,114
-Go!
-Just go!

278
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,751
Get out of here. Go!

279
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,546
Oh, my God.

280
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,639
Come on.

281
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,362
Oh, no, you don't.

282
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,041
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

283
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,135
Excuse me, sir!

284
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,928
I-- I can help. Let me help.

285
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

286
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,974
I need to lead it away from the canals.

287
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,794
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

288
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,505
Oh, this is it.

289
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,756
It's closed.

290
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,633
What do you mean? Till when?

291
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,717
November.

292
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,595
-You didn't check the website?
-Oh, that's a good idea.

293
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:22,986
Oh, come on.

294
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,201
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

295
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,344
Who is that guy?

296
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,471
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

297
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,922
Yeah! Yeah!

298
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,356
It's aliens. It has to be.

299
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,483
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench

300
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,902
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

301
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,237
and got hydro powers.

302
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,406
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

303
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,909
-Spider-Man could take him.
-What do you think it is?

304
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,121
Being a man of science...

305
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,582
witches.

306
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,543
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

307
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,294
Good thing I packed your suit.

308
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,214
-I can't believe you forgot it.
-Yeah.

309
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,050
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

310
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:54,680
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.

311
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:55,931
It was a new guy.

312
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,183
-I was trying to help him--
-Happy, that's my lunch.

313
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,434
Don't eat that one.

314
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,563
-Happy's there?
-Yeah, it's Happy.

315
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,815
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

316
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,067
And he's hanging around the office.

317
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,570
-And he wants to say hi.
-I don't want-- Hi, Peter.

318
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,113
Hey, Happy.

319
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,034
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a-- A leaflet drop.

320
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,996
-What are you doing--?
-Glad you're having a good time.

321
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,123
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

322
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,587
So how's the plan going?

323
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,632
There's been setbacks, for sure.

324
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,218
Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.

325
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,136
I know. Love you.

326
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,429
Bye.

327
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,807
Who is that guy?

328
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,435
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

329
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,645
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

330
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,564
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

331
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,650
What? He's just awesome, okay?

332
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:52,070
He protects the neighborhood
and he's inspiring.

333
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,281
He inspires me to be a better man.

334
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,700
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

335
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,663
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

336
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,709
"L'uomo del misterio" is Italian
for "man of mystery."

337
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,962
-They don't actually know who he is.
-Mysterio.

338
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,298
-Cool name.
-Cool name.

339
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:13,717
-Babe.
-Babe.

340
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,761
So how much of that did you see?

341
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,804
Not much. I was running.

342
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,724
Right. Me too. I was also running...

343
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,934
away.

344
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,354
So Paris tomorrow.

345
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,149
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

346
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,777
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

347
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,487
to create an army of the insane.

348
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,824
Which is why it's my favorite destination
on the whole trip.

349
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,454
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

350
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,039
Nothing.

351
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,125
It's dead.
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

352
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,044
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

353
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,297
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

354
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,340
That's nice.

355
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,509
Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.

356
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,761
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and--

357
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:06,311
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

358
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,983
You're Nick Fury.

359
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,318
And you just shot Ned.

360
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,696
It's a mild tranquilizer. He'll be all right.

361
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,991
So good to finally meet you.

362
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,784
I saw you at the funeral,

363
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,412
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

364
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,455
That would've been inappropriate.

365
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,583
-That's what I just said.
-Right.

366
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:31,461
The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.

367
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,423
You avoided me, and now you're here.

368
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,216
What a coincidence.

369
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,468
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

370
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,847
I used to know everything.

371
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,601
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

372
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,395
No intel, no team.

373
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,689
And a high school kid

374
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,734
is dodging my calls.

375
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,402
Here's what I do know:

376
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:03,285
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

377
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,788
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

378
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,130
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

379
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,340
A village was--

380
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,218
Just making the rounds.

381
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:22,763
See if anyone needs any counseling
after today's traumatic events.

382
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,390
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

383
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,727
Great because I'm--
I'm not qualified to actually--

384
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,354
Oh, he's passed out.

385
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,607
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

386
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,695
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

387
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,990
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening--

388
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,202
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

389
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,995
He's asleep, Betty.

390
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,455
Oh, already?

391
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,290
-Yeah.
-Okay.

392
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,167
That's why it's imperative--

393
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,713
Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

394
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,551
Another person touches that door,
we are going to attend another funeral.

395
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:03,679
-Suit up.
-Let me know if you develop vomiting.

396
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,351
Stark left these for you.

397
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:10,686
Really?

398
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:25,450
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

399
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:30,831
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

400
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,713
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

401
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,423
You'd be feigning anonymity

402
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,925
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

403
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:48,140
Come on.

404
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,225
Yeah.

405
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,106
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

406
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,818
That is Dimitri.

407
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:04,156
And this is Mr. Beck.

408
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,409
Mysterio?

409
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,785
What?

410
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,873
Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.

411
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,501
Well, you can call me Quentin.

412
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,257
You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.

413
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,259
We could use someone like you
on my world.

414
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,053
Thanks.

415
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,554
I'm sorry. Your world?

416
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,349
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

417
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,975
Just not yours.

418
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,769
There are multiple realities.

419
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,980
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

420
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,192
Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

421
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,152
I thought that was theoretical.

422
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,530
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

423
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,782
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

424
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,867
How does that even work
with all the quantum--?

425
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:49,952
It's insane.

426
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,331
Sorry. It's really cool.

427
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,709
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

428
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,129
Anyway...

429
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:06,802
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

430
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,054
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

431
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,682
Air, water, fire, earth.

432
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:14,309
The Science Division had
a technical name.

433
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,478
We just called them Elementals.

434
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,981
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

435
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,858
Turns out, the myths are real.

436
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,734
Like Thor.

437
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,904
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

438
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:28,407
These myths are threats.

439
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,159
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

440
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,494
We mobilized and fought them,

441
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:35,247
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

442
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,292
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

443
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,586
All we did was delay the inevitable.

444
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:43,964
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

445
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,215
Our satellites confirm it.

446
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,010
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

447
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,845
There's only one left: fire.

448
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,849
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

449
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,769
It's the one that took my family.

450
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,691
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,235
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

452
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,489
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

453
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,243
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

454
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:18,957
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

455
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,544
And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

456
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,421
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

457
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,173
I know, but that was an accident.

458
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,175
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

459
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,136
-What about Thor?
-Off-world.

460
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,930
Okay, Doctor Strange.

461
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,556
-Unavailable.
-Captain Marvel.

462
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,058
Don't invoke her name.

463
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,101
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

464
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,771
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

465
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,232
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

466
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,859
my class will figure out who I am, then--

467
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:48,195
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

468
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,073
Okay.

469
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:52,574
I understand.

470
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,035
I'm sorry, what?

471
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,829
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

472
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,623
and become suspicious.

473
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,875
Dimitri.

474
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,211
Take him back to the hotel, please.

475
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:05,212
Yes.

476
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,297
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

477
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,341
And good luck.

478
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,803
See you, kid.

479
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:13,971
Yeah, see you.

480
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,808
-Bye, ma'am.
-Yeah.

481
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,315
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

482
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,277
-You cannot get sick, okay?
-Okay. Thanks, baby.

483
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,154
Hey, are you sure you're good?

484
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,947
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

485
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,366
-Okay. Nice.
-Don't worry.

486
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,286
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

487
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,161
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

488
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,455
-It is pretty awesome.
-Yeah.

489
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,708
-I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
-Seriously.

490
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,127
Good news. We're going to Prague.

491
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,880
-What?
-Prague?

492
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,966
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

493
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:54,011
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

494
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,094
All I heard was crying.

495
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,182
-Look at our upgraded ride.
-Whoa, bro, you see that?

496
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,433
It's pretty sick.

497
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:03,061
-I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
-Oh, come on.

498
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:05,731
Peter, what--? What's going on?

499
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,027
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

500
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,447
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids...

501
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,199
-Oh, all right.
-Okay.

502
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,575
Awesome.

503
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,453
Yeah. Awesome.

504
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,062
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

505
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,940
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

506
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,130
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

507
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,924
Say EDITH."

508
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,054
Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.

509
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,015
-Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
-Hello?

510
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:23,559
Hello, Peter.

511
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:24,810
I am EDITH,

512
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,730
Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defense system.

513
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,524
-So he made you for me?
-No.

514
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,026
But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.

515
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,821
-Cool.
-Would you like to see what I can do?

516
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:45,205
EDITH stands for "Even dead,
I'm the hero."

517
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,249
Tony loved his acronyms.

518
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,458
Yeah, he did.

519
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,628
I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,

520
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,755
including multiple defense satellites,

521
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,217
as well as back doors
to all major telecommunication networks.

522
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,434
Is MJ texting?

523
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:12,107
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

524
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,419
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

525
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,421
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

526
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,632
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

527
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,342
Ten minutes, everyone.

528
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,637
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

529
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:46,058
-Okay. I'll figure it out.
-Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

530
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,309
It's beautiful.

531
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,269
What?

532
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:03,617
Hello.

533
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,993
Close the door.

534
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,209
I'm Peter Parker.

535
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,627
Take off your clothes.

536
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:16,797
-Excuse me?
-You told Fury

537
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,258
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

538
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,426
So I made you this, another suit.

539
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,471
Oh, thank you.

540
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,350
-I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try--
-Take off your clothes.

541
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:29,643
Okay.

542
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:32,646
Sure.

543
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,775
-It's a little embarrassing.
-Now. Hurry up.

544
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:39,194
This is weird.

545
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,365
No, no, no. Don't--

546
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:50,664
-Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
-This is not what it looks like.

547
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,957
-Just--
-Yeah.

548
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,917
-What are you doing?
-I'll leave you alone.

549
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,796
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

550
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,299
-Hey, man, look, that's...
-Look, Peter,

551
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,384
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

552
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,762
If you want to hook up with some
random European chick, that's on you.

553
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,682
-That's not what that was.
-I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

554
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,059
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

555
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,312
-But I like her too.
-Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

556
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:16,648
-You cannot show her that photo, dude.
-I'm sorry, man. I have to.

557
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,692
She deserves the truth.

558
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,112
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

559
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,114
and, everybody, back on the bus.

560
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:26,158
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

561
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,248
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

562
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,959
-EDITH?
-Hello, Peter. How can I help you?

563
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:39,004
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ--

564
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,299
Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?

565
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,302
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

566
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,429
Brad Davis. Is he a target?

567
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:48,889
Is Brad a target?

568
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:57,606
-Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
-Copy that.

569
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:00,776
Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.

570
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,111
-Initiating what, now?
-Intercept point determined.

571
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,072
-Releasing kill vehicle.
-EDITH.

572
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,806
-Oh, my God.
-Dope glasses, Parker.

573
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,016
-How'd you pay for these?
-Flash, give them back.

574
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,018
-I'm really paying you a compliment.
-Please give me--

575
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:37,521
I'm so sorry.

576
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:42,109
-EDITH, don't kill Brad.
-Do you want me to cancel

577
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,611
-the drone strike on Brad Davis?
-Did you punch Flash?

578
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,363
-No.
-Firing.

579
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:50,909
Oh, look out!

580
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,373
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

581
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,833
-EDITH.
-Harrington!

582
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,127
-Is this the autobahn?
-Appears to be.

583
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,463
-Commencing second strike.
-Peter.

584
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,550
-Plant your fanny and buckle up now.
-Look at the baby mountain goats!

585
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,802
-Baby mountain goats?
-I see them.

586
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,319
I don't see any mountain goats.

587
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:26,862
You missed them.

588
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,364
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

589
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,449
What?

590
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,368
...but your new look, I love it.

591
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,370
-Right, babe?
-Thanks.

592
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:38,373
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

593
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,416
Oh, man.

594
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,669
Let's try that again.

595
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:46,048
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

596
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,634
-I--
-Yeah. Weird.

597
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:21,041
-Whoa, freaking beautiful.
-This is amazing.

598
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,544
Wow, this place is so classy.

599
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:25,128
Yeah, so why are we here?

600
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,922
Speak for yourself.

601
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,549
I'm home.

602
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,217
What can I say?

603
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,553
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

604
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:36,265
Everyone get settled, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

605
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:39,935
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

606
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,270
-Yeah!
-Hello?

607
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,772
Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.

608
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,191
Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?

609
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,109
Yes, ma'am.

610
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,485
-Yeah.
-Hey, man.

611
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,821
-Hey.
-Look, I am so sorry

612
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,657
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

613
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,869
-I'm still your guy in the chair.
-No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

614
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,663
-Okay. Great, great.
-It's fine.

615
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:02,082
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

616
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,751
-Where's it gonna happen?
-Here in the city.

617
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,129
-We're here.
-I know. It's not good.

618
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:08,422
I'm figuring it out.

619
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,884
You have to do something, please.
We're counting on you.

620
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,552
-Ned.
-Yeah. Yeah, babe.

621
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:16,388
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

622
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:18,265
-It's about time.
-Serious?

623
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:19,975
Parker? Parker!

624
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:20,976
Yes, sir.

625
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,353
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

626
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:24,813
Are we boring you?

627
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:27,399
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

628
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,026
He had obstacles.

629
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,986
I removed them.

630
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:32,905
They still won't evacuate the city.

631
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,073
Idiots.

632
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,451
So, what's the plan, Parker?

633
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:41,371
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

634
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:44,249
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

635
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,419
-and then Mr. Beck and I will--
-My name is Mysterio.

636
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:52,966
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

637
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,384
Peter, listen to me.

638
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,054
The best hope you have, the only hope,

639
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:00,641
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

640
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,726
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

641
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,687
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

642
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:09,316
If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.

643
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:12,277
After that, there's no way to stop it.

644
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,367
Hey, my friends are here.

645
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,619
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

646
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:23,789
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

647
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:28,210
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

648
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:34,675
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

649
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,678
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

650
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:42,766
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

651
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,109
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

652
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,111
He just--
He felt bad about snapping at you.

653
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,237
Really?

654
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:58,156
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

655
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,034
How you feeling?

656
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,334
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

657
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:11,837
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

658
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:16,842
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

659
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,136
and now it's all ruined.

660
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,979
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

661
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,524
It's a hard path.

662
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,361
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

663
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,323
People look up to you...

664
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,327
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

665
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:46,413
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

666
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:51,668
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

667
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,587
turn around, run away from all this.

668
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,674
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

669
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,469
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

670
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,430
Me too.

671
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,807
But you're worried about your friends.

672
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:06,725
Yeah.

673
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:10,604
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

674
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,901
Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

675
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:16,902
They'll be all right.

676
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:23,408
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to
about superhero stuff, you know?

677
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:25,869
Anytime.

678
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:31,041
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

679
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:36,046
See you out there.

680
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,130
All right.

681
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,054
Sorry, that's Italian.

682
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:50,435
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

683
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,396
-Hello, Peter.
-Hey.

684
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,065
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

685
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,859
Let's see what we can do.

686
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:58,610
Good news.

687
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,279
We're going to the opera!

688
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:01,947
-You're kidding me.
-The opera?

689
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,616
-Don't look at me.
-What happened to the carnival?

690
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,159
This is upgrade living.

691
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:10,163
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

692
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,208
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

693
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:17,671
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

694
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,716
I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

695
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,301
Thank you, Ned.

696
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:25,387
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

697
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,265
the best four hours of our whole trip.

698
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,766
Four hours?

699
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,352
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

700
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:38,025
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

701
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,527
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

702
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,571
instead of the biggest party in the world.

703
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,448
Again, don't look at me.

704
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,034
Parker, do you copy?

705
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,493
Comm check, one, two.

706
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:54,374
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.

707
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,001
Yeah, the rush out.

708
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,379
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

709
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,507
Let's go.

710
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,968
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

711
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:15,521
-You look really pretty.
-And therefore, I have value?

712
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,482
No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just--

713
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,067
I'm messing with you.

714
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:22,986
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

715
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,031
-You look pretty too.
-Thank you.

716
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,617
-Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
-So cute.

717
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,452
-Can I...?
-Yeah.

718
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:32,246
Want to go in on a pair?

719
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,666
-You mean, sit next to each other?
-Yeah.

720
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,501
Are you in position?

721
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,461
-No.
-Okay. No...

722
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:42,130
-Why the hell not? Parker?
-you don't want to sit next to me,

723
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,884
-or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
-I didn't mean that.

724
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:48,387
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

725
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,306
I'll save you a seat next to me.

726
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,101
-A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.
-Awesome.

727
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:55,978
Okay.

728
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,272
-Parker.
-No, I'm coming. I'm...

729
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:02,901
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

730
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,195
Okay. Be careful.

731
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,488
And whatever you do,

732
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:09,324
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

733
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,118
Yeah, Ned, I know.

734
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,160
-Okay.
-Okay?

735
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,871
-Yeah.
-Gotta go.

736
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,847
Parker! You better be on your way.

737
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,973
Coming.

738
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:41,481
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

739
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:43,775
-Oh, I-- I don't--
-We should go. Yes, we should go.

740
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,320
Come on, let's go. Come on.

741
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,838
All right. I'm in position.

742
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:08,342
As soon as I see something, Beck,
I'll-- I'll let you know.

743
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,511
-Roger that.
-How's the suit?

744
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:11,845
The suit's great.

745
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,098
It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

746
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,142
-Parker!
-Okay, I'll shut up.

747
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,728
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

748
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,147
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

749
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:25,484
-What's wrong?
-You know, honestly, I just--

750
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,111
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should--

751
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:30,989
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

752
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,124
Don't worry, babe.

753
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,544
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

754
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:45,254
You'll feel a thousand times better.

755
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,928
-Energy spiking.
-We have seismic activity.

756
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,733
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?

757
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:08,902
-You know what to do.
-On your lead, Spider-Man.

758
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,326
No, come back!

759
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,036
Come back and help us!

760
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,961
You're up, kid.

761
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,309
Wait, wait. Is that...?

762
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,728
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

763
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,063
No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

764
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,899
I actually read about him. It's not him.

765
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,497
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

766
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:03,790
He's getting bigger!

767
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,168
What's his name? What's his name?

768
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,836
It's Night-- Night Monkey.

769
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,338
-Night Monkey?
-Yeah.

770
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,964
-Yeah.
-Night Monkey!

771
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,050
-Yeah. Night Monkey.
-Night Monkey, help!

772
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,344
-Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck!
-What?

773
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,179
-Oh, no, no.
-Help us! Help!

774
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,111
Are you okay?

775
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,325
On to Plan B?

776
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,827
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

777
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,455
I go left, you go right! Now!

778
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,597
Okay, shoot him!

779
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:01,974
Yeah!

780
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:06,436
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

781
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,613
Spider-Man, keep your distance.

782
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,532
I'm trying!

783
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,534
Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.

784
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,160
Okay. I'm on it!

785
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,643
Whoa, what is that?!

786
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:55,903
Betty! Betty!

787
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:19,510
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

788
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,768
No, no, no.

789
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,359
It's too late.

790
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,695
Whatever happens...

791
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,405
I'm glad we met.

792
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:42,324
Beck, what are you doing?

793
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:45,953
What I should have done last time.

794
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:51,959
Beck, don't do it!

795
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,714
Beck!

796
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:18,944
Mr. Beck?

797
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:23,407
Oh, thank God.

798
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,211
I would kiss you,
but I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

799
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:41,341
I might have a mint.

800
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,094
So it's over?

801
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,929
That was the last of them.

802
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:49,099
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

803
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:52,769
We need to stay vigilant.

804
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:55,355
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

805
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:59,318
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

806
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:00,652
You should join us.

807
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:05,449
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

808
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:18,962
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

809
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:22,299
-Mr. Fury, I--
-I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

810
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:27,137
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

811
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,681
Stark chose you.

812
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:32,601
He made you an Avenger.

813
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:34,603
I need that.

814
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,980
The world needs that.

815
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:39,274
Maybe Stark was wrong.

816
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:43,862
Was he?

817
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,449
The choice is yours.

818
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,507
Let's get a drink.

819
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,428
I'm not 21.

820
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:16,311
Hey.

821
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,900
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

822
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:22,818
Yeah.

823
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,196
Fury was right.

824
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,740
Tony did a lot for me...

825
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,826
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

826
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,786
Do you?

827
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,872
Yeah. I mean...

828
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:39,334
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

829
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,253
He wanted me to be better than him.

830
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:44,339
-And Fury wants me to live up to that.
-What do you want?

831
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:47,009
-What do you mean?
-What do you want?

832
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,638
-I don't know.
-What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

833
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:54,474
-I know you're thinking about it.
-I wanna go on my trip.

834
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,852
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

835
00:57:56,935 --> 00:58:00,022
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

836
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:03,483
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

837
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:06,612
and give her a kiss.

838
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:08,322
Shut up, man.

839
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,575
-You're not gonna do that, are you?
-No, I can't.

840
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,492
Why not?

841
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:14,578
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

842
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,832
-My God. Thank you so much.
-What are those?

843
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,001
-Are those the--?
-EDITH glasses, yeah.

844
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:24,588
They were just on the floor? Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.

845
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,672
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

846
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,220
I actually really like them.

847
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,764
-Can I be completely honest with you?
-Please.

848
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,599
They look really stupid.

849
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,353
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

850
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:40,896
You try them on.

851
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:42,689
-No, come on.
-Try them on.

852
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:44,942
-I don't wanna try them on.
-Just put them on.

853
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,159
What do you think, kid?

854
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,916
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

855
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,628
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

856
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:05,587
What?

857
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:08,090
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

858
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,008
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

859
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:12,678
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

860
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,805
He knew every mistake I ever made.

861
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:17,224
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

862
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:18,642
Why give it to you?

863
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:22,688
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

864
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:25,065
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

865
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:28,610
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

866
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,112
You're probably right.

867
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:33,365
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

868
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:36,410
And it's not me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

869
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:39,329
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

870
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:42,374
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

871
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:45,502
No. Peter, come on. No.

872
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,173
-EDITH?
-Hello, Peter.

873
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,674
Hi. Yeah...

874
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:54,928
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

875
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:57,347
-Peter, what are you doing?
-Doing the right thing.

876
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:01,810
-Any transfer will require confirmation.
-Stark gave you the glasses.

877
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:05,314
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

878
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:07,733
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

879
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,819
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

880
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:12,529
He'd want you to have them.

881
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:14,156
Waiting for confirmation.

882
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,073
Confirm.

883
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,621
Welcome to the Avengers.

884
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:30,172
They look good on you.

885
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:32,883
Thank you.

886
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:34,343
It's an honor.

887
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:35,928
Yeah.

888
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:39,681
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

889
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:41,934
Where you headed?

890
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:44,728
-I'm gonna go find MJ.
-Good luck, kid.

891
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,231
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward.

892
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,150
Yeah.

893
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,985
-See you later, man.
-See you.

894
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,061
See? That wasn't so hard.

895
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:27,145
Yes!

896
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,149
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

897
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:39,533
Okay, we got EDITH.

898
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,535
Get these connected to our system.

899
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:44,037
Toast! Toast! Toast!

900
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,707
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

901
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,542
Toast! Toast! Toast!

902
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,335
Yeah!

903
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,796
Okay, toasts!

904
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,089
Give me that, Doug.

905
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:58,010
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

906
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,096
The jester king.

907
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,684
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

908
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,728
that he was unfit to wield.

909
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,147
Like the holographic system I designed.

910
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,941
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

911
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:15,235
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

912
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:16,153
and renamed--

913
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:19,781
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

914
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:26,914
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

915
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,793
He renamed my life's work "BARF."

916
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:33,086
I told him it was a mistake,

917
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,339
that my technology could change
the world.

918
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:37,841
And then...

919
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,302
he fired me.

920
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,138
Said I was...

921
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:45,641
unstable.

922
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:50,062
-To Tony.
-To Tony!

923
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:53,732
-Next, to William.
-William!

924
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:57,569
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

925
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:00,239
With a box of scraps!

926
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:02,199
The integration of my illusion tech

927
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:04,535
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

928
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,954
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

929
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:08,372
And it's just the beginning.

930
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,415
-Thank you, brother.
-To Guterman.

931
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,750
-Guterman!
-To Guterman!

932
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:14,837
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

933
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,090
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

934
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:20,884
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

935
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,678
I mean, everybody bought it.

936
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,179
-Gutes!
-Guterman!

937
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:26,431
-To Victoria.
-To Victoria!

938
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,684
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

939
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,936
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

940
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:32,396
Inspired idea.

941
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,898
-To Janice.
-Janice!

942
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:37,401
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

943
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:41,363
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

944
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:42,406
but to a child.

945
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,074
-Thank you.
-To Janice!

946
01:03:44,157 --> 01:03:46,994
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

947
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:49,997
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

948
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,541
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

949
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:55,210
the most qualified, and no one cares.

950
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:58,714
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

951
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:01,383
no one will even listen.

952
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:06,805
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

953
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:09,933
With our technology and with EDITH,

954
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:14,897
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

955
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,064
Yeah!

956
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:18,817
Then everyone will listen!

957
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:25,157
-Not to a boozy man-child.
-No!

958
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,743
Not to a hormonal teenager.

959
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,953
No!

960
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:31,121
To me...

961
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:34,416
and to my very wealthy crew.

962
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:36,752
-To us.
-To us.

963
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:39,838
-To Mysterio!
-To Mysterio!

964
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,883
-To Peter Parker.
-To Peter Parker!

965
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,177
Poor kid.

966
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:48,138
Let's get to work.

967
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,353
-Peter, oh, my God.
-Hey. Hey.

968
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:56,688
-We almost died.
-It's fine. It's fine.

969
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:58,524
Hey, I'm done with the mission.

970
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,859
-Dude, the trip's over.
-What?

971
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:03,028
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

972
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,821
Of course our parents want us home.

973
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,699
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

974
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:11,578
Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't-- Put some clothes on.

975
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:12,871
We're booking flights.

976
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,207
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

977
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,042
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

978
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:21,463
-What is going on?
-We're going home in the morning.

979
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:23,841
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

980
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:25,801
-Ned.
-Coming, sweetie.

981
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:29,179
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

982
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:32,432
-Yeah.
-Hey.

983
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,811
-Hey.
-Where were you?

984
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:39,314
-I got lost.
-We were worried about you.

985
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:43,068
-Good thing you're back.
-Yeah.

986
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,530
-So much for Paris.
-It would've been fun.

987
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:49,283
-Yeah. Night.
-Night.

988
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:52,119
You look ni--

989
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:00,627
Okay.

990
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:03,839
-Hey.
-Hey.

991
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:05,799
Look...

992
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:11,763
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun

993
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:15,767
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

994
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,603
Yes.

995
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,813
"Yes," like you wanna go?

996
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:21,064
Yes.

997
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:24,943
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

998
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:26,862
Meet me outside in five minutes.

999
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:29,448
-Five is good.
-Okay.

1000
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:30,991
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1001
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:37,915
Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!

1002
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:47,841
-Hey.
-Hey.

1003
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,301
Where do you wanna go?

1004
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:51,136
-Who cares?
-Awesome.

1005
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,221
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1006
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:01,563
-I'm glad we're doing this.
-Yeah, me too.

1007
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,273
To see the city a bit.

1008
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:06,818
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1009
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:10,822
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1010
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:14,868
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1011
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:21,792
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1012
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,794
for a while.

1013
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:26,588
Yeah?

1014
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,633
It's our last night in Europe,

1015
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:33,720
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1016
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:35,347
I'm just gonna tell you.

1017
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:39,643
-MJ, I--
-"I'm Spider-Man."

1018
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:42,938
-What?
-That's what you were gonna say.

1019
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:44,064
That you're Spider-Man.

1020
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:48,527
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1021
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,697
I've been watching you for a while now.

1022
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,074
It's kind of obvious.

1023
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,285
I'm not Spider-Man.

1024
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,787
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1025
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,914
-Peter, Washington?
-Yeah?

1026
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:04,626
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1027
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,671
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my-- The tummy?

1028
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:09,423
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1029
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,842
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1030
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:14,928
-Then you're Spider-Man.
-I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1031
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:18,348
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1032
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,850
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1033
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,437
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1034
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,979
-The Night Monkey?
-Yeah.

1035
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:27,064
That's what it said on the news,

1036
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,484
and the news never lies.

1037
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,654
-Night Monkey. Okay.
-What are you doing?

1038
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:38,993
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1039
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:41,412
I mean, maybe.

1040
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:44,082
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1041
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:51,089
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1042
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:55,426
Yeah.

1043
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:58,764
Why else would I be watching you?

1044
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:03,560
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe--

1045
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,109
What the hell was that?

1046
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:13,987
I don't know.

1047
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:27,751
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1048
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:31,129
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1049
01:09:31,587 --> 01:09:33,506
It-- It looked so real.

1050
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,968
-It...
-Yeah, really real.

1051
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:40,055
-Wait, does that mean that--?
-The Elementals are fake?

1052
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:43,600
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1053
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:46,728
There was fire and destruction, and...

1054
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:49,689
Who would do something like that?

1055
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:00,784
Mysterio.

1056
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,124
I am Spider-Man.

1057
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,920
-And I've really messed up.
-Wait. You're being serious?

1058
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:15,048
You're 100 percent serious?
Because it's not funny.

1059
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,049
No, I'm not joking.

1060
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:18,343
Because I was--
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1061
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,304
-MJ--
-So why are you here?

1062
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:23,348
-Why are you on this school trip?
-I know you have a lot of questions,

1063
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,184
but we have to get out of here, okay?

1064
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:28,395
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1065
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:32,316
You took everything from me!

1066
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,068
This is for my family!

1067
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:42,910
Pause.

1068
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,704
Pause.

1069
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:48,123
Sorry.

1070
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,126
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1071
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,252
Yep. Stand by.

1072
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:59,801
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1073
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:03,388
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.

1074
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,932
Kill image.

1075
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,350
De-cloak drones.

1076
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,228
All right, weapons.

1077
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,563
-You want to weaponize?
-Yep.

1078
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:13,398
Weapons only. Stand by.

1079
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,576
-Nice.
-Stop.

1080
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,330
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something--

1081
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:32,876
Just dou-- You know what?
Double the damage and then run it again.

1082
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,461
You want me to double it up?

1083
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:35,921
-Yeah.
-All right.

1084
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,297
Cover your ears.

1085
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,517
That is good! That's good.

1086
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:51,144
-We on schedule?
-Oh, yeah.

1087
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,730
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1088
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:57,234
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1089
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,235
All right, well done.

1090
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,904
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1091
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:03,448
-That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
-Oh, yeah.

1092
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:06,201
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1093
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:09,329
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

1094
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:11,039
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1095
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:14,334
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1096
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:18,672
But when its new savior descends,

1097
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:21,300
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1098
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:25,179
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1099
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,722
Of course. Do you wanna try--?

1100
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,724
No, no, that's--
What's going on with my hand?

1101
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:30,142
Why is that happening?

1102
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:33,520
Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1103
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:34,438
It's fine.

1104
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:37,941
Wait, and you're--?
You're telling me this now?

1105
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,277
It's-- It's one drone.

1106
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,197
-The image will be perfect, I promise.
-That projector is evidence.

1107
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,325
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1108
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:50,078
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1109
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:53,624
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1110
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,919
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

1111
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:59,338
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1112
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,508
Right?

1113
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,970
William, can you look at me?

1114
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:10,265
Pull up EDITH.

1115
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:13,227
Hello, Quentin.

1116
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:17,147
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1117
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,273
Magnifying.

1118
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:21,985
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1119
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,071
Located.

1120
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:26,740
Shit.

1121
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,037
You know, William, one day,

1122
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,581
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1123
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:38,961
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1124
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:45,467
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?

1125
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:49,221
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1126
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,932
You had access to killer drones?

1127
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:55,394
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1128
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:57,020
You almost killed Brad?

1129
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:01,024
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...

1130
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:04,236
-but I think he tapped my phone.
-So, what are you gonna do?

1131
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:07,155
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin

1132
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:09,074
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1133
01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:14,788
Just...

1134
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:35,809
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1135
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:37,978
The costume looks great...

1136
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:42,900
for the costume party
at the prince's castle.

1137
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:44,443
She knows. I told her.

1138
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,778
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1139
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:51,700
-That's cool.
-Like, a long time ago.

1140
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:57,372
-Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
-But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1141
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,666
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1142
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,669
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1143
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:04,880
That's crazy.

1144
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,048
Yeah.

1145
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,303
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1146
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,346
It's been mostly me.

1147
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,766
Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1148
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,185
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin, okay?

1149
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:19,603
Got it. Easy.

1150
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,356
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1151
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:25,943
-I gotta go.
-Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1152
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,444
You're gonna need this.

1153
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:31,865
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1154
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:41,917
So you know too.

1155
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,043
It's cool.

1156
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:46,338
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1157
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,279
-Excuse me. Do you know where--?
-Nacht Monkey!

1158
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:12,698
No, wait, I didn't-- Oh, man.

1159
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:16,785
Get in.

1160
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:26,336
-Mr. Fury--
-You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1161
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,589
-No, no, no, listen.
-Wait until we're secure.

1162
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,257
Okay.

1163
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:36,805
Right.

1164
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:06,418
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1165
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:08,003
He's talking about EDITH.

1166
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,173
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1167
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:14,176
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1168
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,761
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1169
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:18,514
That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1170
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:22,392
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1171
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:26,063
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1172
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,773
was created by this?

1173
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,983
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1174
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:35,239
Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1175
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:36,990
Who else did you tell about this?

1176
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:40,160
Parker? Parker!

1177
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:42,746
-What's wrong?
-It's Beck. He's here.

1178
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:45,415
What? Hill?

1179
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:52,130
No, it's just an illu--

1180
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:54,424
Fury!

1181
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:02,099
Wow, Peter, wow.

1182
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,226
I thought we were close.

1183
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:07,855
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1184
01:18:07,938 --> 01:18:09,064
Stop hiding, Beck!

1185
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:13,819
I tried to help you walk away.

1186
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,904
Now you're making me do this.

1187
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:23,287
You told me, you were just a kid.

1188
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,708
You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.

1189
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,751
-Help me!
-MJ!

1190
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:31,920
Oh, God!

1191
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:37,050
-Peter, what's going on?
-I know this isn't real.

1192
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:38,385
Do you, though?

1193
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:42,389
MJ! MJ!

1194
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:48,353
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1195
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:02,910
You need to wake up!

1196
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:28,352
I mean, look at yourself.

1197
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:42,783
You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.

1198
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:48,664
I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.

1199
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,541
I control the truth.

1200
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:53,377
Mysterio is the truth.

1201
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:20,904
If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1202
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,879
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1203
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:52,436
You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.

1204
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:56,481
And now you have--

1205
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,912
Fury.

1206
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:14,625
Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1207
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:16,752
Who'd you tell?

1208
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,671
I know you told someone, so just tell me.

1209
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,465
-Okay.
-Who did you tell?

1210
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:24,801
-Who else did you tell?!
-Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1211
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:27,221
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1212
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:29,723
What?

1213
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:32,476
You are so gullible.

1214
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,603
-What?
-You're smart as a whip.

1215
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:35,938
Just a...

1216
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:37,940
sucker.

1217
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,276
-And now all your friends have to die.
-Oh, my God.

1218
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:49,034
It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.

1219
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,041
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1220
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,086
I really am sorry.

1221
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,013
-EDITH.
-Yes, Quentin.

1222
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,599
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1223
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:15,602
I need them to fly home from London.

1224
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:56,143
Hi.

1225
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:58,520
Where am I?

1226
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:00,981
Municipal holding facility.

1227
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:04,776
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1228
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,113
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1229
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:09,406
Thanks.

1230
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:12,910
You guys are nice.

1231
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:16,079
You speak really good English.

1232
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,956
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1233
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:21,335
-I'm in the Netherlands right now?
-Yep.

1234
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:24,838
Bye.

1235
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:25,923
Guard!

1236
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,634
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1237
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:30,636
-Yeah, she's pregnant.
-Oh, yeah?

1238
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,595
Yeah.

1239
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:40,646
Yeah.

1240
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:42,523
Yeah.

1241
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:44,942
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1242
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,948
You guys okay?

1243
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:04,878
-Excuse me, sir?
-Yeah?

1244
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:07,172
-Could I borrow your phone?
-Yeah.

1245
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,092
Everyone is so nice here.

1246
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:12,427
Okay.

1247
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:18,600
Okay.

1248
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:22,980
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey...

1249
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,150
I messed up. I need a-- I need a ride.

1250
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:30,696
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1251
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:32,364
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1252
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:36,910
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1253
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:39,955
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1254
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:42,916
Yeah, no problem.

1255
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,543
Thanks.

1256
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:45,627
Did you get that?

1257
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,568
Peter? Are you okay?

1258
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,446
-Happy, is that you?
-Yeah, of course it's me.

1259
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:16,033
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1260
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:17,701
Only I would know...

1261
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:20,746
Remember when we went to Germany?

1262
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:22,664
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1263
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:26,543
They didn't list the titles, but I could tell
by the price it was an adult film.

1264
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:29,463
-And you didn't know how I knew--
-Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1265
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:34,009
It's so good to see you.

1266
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:37,763
You'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1267
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:40,599
Okay, hold still.

1268
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:41,892
There we go.

1269
01:25:48,315 --> 01:25:49,399
Ouch.

1270
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:52,444
-I thought you had super strength.
-It still hurts.

1271
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:57,074
-Happy, come on.
-All right, relax.

1272
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,119
-Just a few more. There we go.
-Oh, my God, Happy.

1273
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:02,913
-Relax.
-Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1274
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:05,415
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1275
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,418
I trusted Beck. Right?

1276
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:12,464
I thought he was my friend. I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,

1277
01:26:12,548 --> 01:26:14,800
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1278
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:17,469
so please do not tell me to relax.

1279
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:22,224
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1280
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:26,728
I just really miss him.

1281
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:29,189
Yeah, I miss him too.

1282
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:33,735
Everywhere I go...

1283
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:36,446
I see his face.

1284
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:41,034
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1285
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:47,082
and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1286
01:26:49,126 --> 01:26:50,335
You're not Iron Man.

1287
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,255
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1288
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:57,509
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1289
01:26:57,593 --> 01:26:59,094
Not even Tony.

1290
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:02,514
Tony was my best friend.

1291
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:03,724
And he was a mess.

1292
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:07,311
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1293
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:11,148
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1294
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:16,778
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1295
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:19,948
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1296
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:26,246
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1297
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,750
What are you gonna do about it?

1298
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,757
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1299
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,843
But I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1300
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:42,888
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1301
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:45,891
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1302
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:47,559
Give me your phone.

1303
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:48,894
-My cell phone?
-Yeah.

1304
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:50,479
Okay. Here.

1305
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:52,898
-What's your password?
-"Password."

1306
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:56,193
-No, what is your password?
-"Password," spelled out.

1307
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:58,445
Head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1308
01:27:58,529 --> 01:27:59,863
I don't feel good about it either.

1309
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:02,991
Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.

1310
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:05,077
-They're in London.
-London, okay.

1311
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,162
-Yeah, I need a suit.
-Suit?

1312
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:29,685
Okay...

1313
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:33,397
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1314
01:28:40,529 --> 01:28:43,198
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1315
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:51,248
What?

1316
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:53,333
Nothing.

1317
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:55,919
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1318
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:02,009
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1319
01:29:07,431 --> 01:29:09,683
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1320
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:14,980
Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1321
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:18,108
to a factor of 25 percent,

1322
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,986
and give me complete manual control
over detonation.

1323
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:27,201
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1324
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:30,162
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1325
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,748
-I thought that was over.
-It's the biggest one yet.

1326
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:34,583
-Where?
-London.

1327
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:37,085
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1328
01:29:37,169 --> 01:29:40,214
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1329
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,927
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1330
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,303
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1331
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:49,014
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1332
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:50,766
No, I'm talking about Peter.

1333
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,935
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1334
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:55,729
Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman

1335
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:58,232
in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,

1336
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:00,192
like back at the opera, huh?

1337
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:03,654
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1338
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:06,198
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1339
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:11,370
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1340
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:12,496
George Orwell.

1341
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:13,830
-Thank you, MJ.
-Yeah.

1342
01:30:13,914 --> 01:30:18,544
Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1343
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:20,879
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1344
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:22,631
Yeah, what's that about?

1345
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:25,425
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was--

1346
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:28,679
-I was trying to take a--
-Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1347
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,557
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1348
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,268
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class.

1349
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:35,602
Okay.

1350
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,689
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1351
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,275
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.

1352
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:45,028
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1353
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:46,655
-Okay?
-Look at this, guys.

1354
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:48,282
Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.

1355
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,827
-We got a bus all to ourselves.
-Nice to see you all. Come along.

1356
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:53,954
-I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
-Thank you.

1357
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:55,998
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1358
01:30:56,081 --> 01:30:57,875
All right.

1359
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,710
I have the kids.

1360
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:05,090
I got here as fast as I could.

1361
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:08,594
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1362
01:31:08,677 --> 01:31:09,511
Damn it.

1363
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:13,182
Pulse is spiking.

1364
01:31:13,265 --> 01:31:16,476
-I'll take another look.
-Soon as you see something, report.

1365
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,854
You're all we've got, Beck.

1366
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:21,648
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1367
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:24,067
God help us all.

1368
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:27,571
Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1369
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,490
-William, launch the drones.
-Copy that, brother.

1370
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:34,244
Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1371
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:42,294
-Excellent. Janice?
-Working on the cape.

1372
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:45,047
Get those wrinkles out. I could be
shaking hands with the queen.

1373
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,632
-Guterman?
-Almost in position.

1374
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:49,301
-Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
-Increasing pulse.

1375
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:54,389
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1376
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:55,724
EDITH?

1377
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,351
Yes, Quentin.

1378
01:31:57,434 --> 01:31:59,144
Show me my loose ends.

1379
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:02,773
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1380
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,024
-Copy.
-All right.

1381
01:32:04,107 --> 01:32:05,192
Start the show.

1382
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,238
Let's save the world, people.

1383
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,367
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1384
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:17,496
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1385
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,040
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1386
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:25,671
That doesn't look good.

1387
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:27,714
But it's fake,
there's nothing to worry about.

1388
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:31,927
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1389
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,387
Great work, Guterman.

1390
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:38,183
-What?
-Happy Hogan here.

1391
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:40,352
-I know. What do you want?
-Over at Mr. Stark's,

1392
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:42,062
going through his belongings.

1393
01:32:42,145 --> 01:32:44,147
-There was a surfboard you left behind.
-What?

1394
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:46,775
People there said they didn't think
Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:

1395
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:51,446
-"Appearances can be deceiving."
-It's not mine. And don't ever call again.

1396
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:03,542
Fury's got the coded message.
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1397
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,919
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1398
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:08,130
-I'll scoop them up, okay?
-Yeah.

1399
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:09,339
-We're close.
-We're close.

1400
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:10,799
-How's the suit?
-Almost done.

1401
01:33:10,883 --> 01:33:12,968
-Good.
-Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go...

1402
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:16,513
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1403
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:18,765
You'll make it back.
You'll give it to her yourself.

1404
01:33:18,849 --> 01:33:20,225
-Okay? You got this.
-I got this.

1405
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:23,145
-Walk me through it.
-I know it's illusion tech.

1406
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:26,148
All I have to do is get inside the illusion,
then I can take it down,

1407
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:29,193
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1408
01:33:29,276 --> 01:33:31,695
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1409
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:34,865
True, but this time--

1410
01:33:34,948 --> 01:33:37,784
How do I explain this?
I have a sixth sense.

1411
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:41,413
The Peter-tingle.
That's what you're talking about, right?

1412
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:42,706
It's not working, though.

1413
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:45,542
-I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?
-It is working.

1414
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:48,170
-I don't know if it's working--
-So you got the Peter-tingle.

1415
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:50,506
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1416
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:53,884
-You get that Peter-tingle back online.
-I got this.

1417
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:11,235
-Cue the lightning.
-Cuing lightning.

1418
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:20,702
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1419
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:21,787
Oh, my.

1420
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:26,625
-What did the bus driver say?
-Bus driver's gone.

1421
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,043
-What?!
-Where?!

1422
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:30,963
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it
under control!

1423
01:34:31,046 --> 01:34:35,259
-Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.
-I'm doing my best, Julius!

1424
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:37,678
-Look--
-Oh, the witches are back.

1425
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:39,596
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1426
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:47,229
-Okay.
-Okay, follow me, kids.

1427
01:34:49,982 --> 01:34:51,400
Come on, let's go!

1428
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:07,416
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1429
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,809
This way. This way!

1430
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:27,352
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, my God!

1431
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,146
-Flash!
-Follow that cursed hand.

1432
01:35:29,229 --> 01:35:30,856
This way, kids. Follow me.

1433
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:34,067
-It's not real, it's not real!
-It looks real to me!

1434
01:35:34,151 --> 01:35:35,444
Follow me, kids!

1435
01:35:36,486 --> 01:35:37,696
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1436
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:40,699
Oh, no. They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1437
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,492
-You're thinking of Voltron.
-Who?

1438
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:44,453
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1439
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:46,330
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1440
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:47,623
He's gonna save us!

1441
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:52,920
If Mysterio knows we know...

1442
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:55,088
-Then we're in danger.
-Yeah, and so are they.

1443
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:56,423
We should go.

1444
01:35:57,841 --> 01:35:58,800
Kill that witch!

1445
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:03,347
This is for my family!

1446
01:36:05,015 --> 01:36:06,808
Get somewhere safe, Fury.

1447
01:36:06,892 --> 01:36:08,477
I don't see this ending well.

1448
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,606
I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.

1449
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:16,401
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1450
01:36:16,485 --> 01:36:19,029
-I can. It's a little loud out here.
-I like the new suit.

1451
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:22,241
-Thanks.
-Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1452
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:24,826
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1453
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,370
Still the play?

1454
01:36:26,453 --> 01:36:28,830
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1455
01:36:28,914 --> 01:36:30,791
Copy. Stay sticky.

1456
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:36,004
-Hey, Happy.
-Yeah, kid. What is it?

1457
01:36:36,088 --> 01:36:39,508
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1458
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,607
Beck, report!

1459
01:36:55,691 --> 01:36:58,110
Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1460
01:36:58,193 --> 01:37:01,572
"It's all the Elementals.
They're merged into something..."

1461
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:03,657
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1462
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:05,742
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1463
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:12,499
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1464
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:16,628
Is that...?

1465
01:37:21,717 --> 01:37:23,093
Be ready for anything.

1466
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:24,261
Yeah.

1467
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:32,603
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1468
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,485
That's awesome.

1469
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:08,347
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1470
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,766
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1471
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:12,851
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1472
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,735
Do you see anything?

1473
01:38:21,818 --> 01:38:24,863
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.

1474
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,370
I hope this works.

1475
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:48,554
You got me?

1476
01:38:53,642 --> 01:38:54,560
I got you.

1477
01:38:55,102 --> 01:38:56,854
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1478
01:39:00,566 --> 01:39:01,775
I see you.

1479
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:07,781
-EDITH, give me protection.
-Copy.

1480
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:25,340
-Just kill the illusion. Kill it.
-I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1481
01:39:25,424 --> 01:39:27,885
They'll see what I want them to see!

1482
01:39:27,968 --> 01:39:30,929
-Do you still need the cape?
-Yes, Janice.

1483
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:33,098
-I still need the cape.
-Done.

1484
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:38,270
-William, render my illusion suit.
-All right, hang on.

1485
01:39:38,353 --> 01:39:40,522
The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!

1486
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:41,857
There you are.

1487
01:39:45,569 --> 01:39:46,653
Easy.

1488
01:39:50,949 --> 01:39:52,284
Who the hell is that?

1489
01:39:53,994 --> 01:39:55,120
-Ned!
-Happy!

1490
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:57,497
I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1491
01:39:57,581 --> 01:39:59,750
-Who are you?
-I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1492
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:01,752
-Get on that jet.
-You work for Spider-Man?

1493
01:40:01,835 --> 01:40:04,129
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1494
01:40:07,341 --> 01:40:09,343
-New plan. Into the Tower.
-What?

1495
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:12,387
-Happy, are you okay?
-We're okay. Just get Beck.

1496
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:14,848
-EDITH, target Spider-Man.
-Copy.

1497
01:40:19,645 --> 01:40:21,522
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1498
01:40:36,161 --> 01:40:37,538
There you are.

1499
01:40:39,957 --> 01:40:41,625
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1500
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:43,627
-Yeah, go, go, go!
-Come on.

1501
01:40:47,548 --> 01:40:49,967
-Go!
-Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick.

1502
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,176
Go into the vault!

1503
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,553
-What?
-Into the vault. Go!

1504
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:56,598
Take cover!

1505
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:16,702
Okay.

1506
01:41:21,415 --> 01:41:22,249
Yeah?

1507
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,209
No. No.

1508
01:41:28,463 --> 01:41:29,756
I see you.

1509
01:41:31,967 --> 01:41:32,968
Get that thing out--

1510
01:41:38,515 --> 01:41:39,683
Go!

1511
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:48,150
How does Cap do that?!

1512
01:41:57,951 --> 01:42:01,163
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1513
01:42:01,246 --> 01:42:03,540
-I'm here. I'm here.
-Happy, thank God.

1514
01:42:03,624 --> 01:42:05,125
I bought us some time.

1515
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:08,545
-But not much.
-I'm trying to get to Beck,

1516
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:10,297
but I can't shake these drones!

1517
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:26,104
Gotcha.

1518
01:42:48,418 --> 01:42:49,586
Going up!

1519
01:43:26,665 --> 01:43:28,000
Finally.

1520
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:32,087
-Hey, William, how we doing?
-Illusion almost back up.

1521
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:33,881
I don't know how you're gonna spin this.

1522
01:43:49,062 --> 01:43:50,355
Oh, great. No webs.

1523
01:44:04,036 --> 01:44:06,288
-Are we gonna die?
-Nobody dies on my watch.

1524
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:11,710
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1525
01:44:12,586 --> 01:44:15,589
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1526
01:44:16,507 --> 01:44:19,176
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1527
01:44:19,259 --> 01:44:21,887
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1528
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:24,097
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1529
01:44:24,181 --> 01:44:27,851
Spider-Man--? Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1530
01:44:27,935 --> 01:44:29,645
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1531
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:31,146
-MJ!
-Stop it!

1532
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:32,606
I'm sorry, okay?

1533
01:44:32,689 --> 01:44:35,692
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts people's feelings.

1534
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:39,112
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1535
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:44,618
We're sharing, right?

1536
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:25,242
Your lies are over, Beck.

1537
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:29,955
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1538
01:45:30,038 --> 01:45:31,456
EDITH?

1539
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:41,717
Just give me the glasses.

1540
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:42,926
You want these?

1541
01:45:45,095 --> 01:45:45,929
Come and get them.

1542
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:57,733
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1543
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:25,093
-Why aren't these drones firing?
-You're in the strike zone.

1544
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:29,973
-The chance of getting hit is--
-No, fire all the drones now!

1545
01:46:48,325 --> 01:46:49,159
Beck!

1546
01:46:53,205 --> 01:46:54,248
Beck.

1547
01:46:55,374 --> 01:46:56,834
You lied to me.

1548
01:46:57,543 --> 01:46:59,711
-I trusted you.
-I know.

1549
01:47:00,254 --> 01:47:02,172
That's the most...

1550
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:04,007
disappointing part.

1551
01:47:05,634 --> 01:47:07,594
You're a good person, Peter.

1552
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:11,640
Such a weakness.

1553
01:47:13,684 --> 01:47:14,935
Stark was right.

1554
01:47:15,936 --> 01:47:17,354
You do deserve them.

1555
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:30,742
You can't trick me anymore.

1556
01:47:34,746 --> 01:47:36,373
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1557
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:40,836
Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.

1558
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:43,755
-Execute all cancellation protocols?
-Just do it.

1559
01:47:43,839 --> 01:47:45,716
-Execute them all.
-Confirmed.

1560
01:47:54,892 --> 01:47:55,976
Give me the spear.

1561
01:47:57,269 --> 01:47:58,478
That's a halberd.

1562
01:48:03,483 --> 01:48:04,484
Thank you.

1563
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:12,034
-How could you do all of this?
-You'll see, Peter.

1564
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:16,830
People, they need to believe.

1565
01:48:18,373 --> 01:48:19,750
And nowadays...

1566
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:23,921
they'll believe anything.

1567
01:48:34,806 --> 01:48:35,807
Is he...?

1568
01:48:37,434 --> 01:48:38,560
Is this real?

1569
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:42,064
All illusions are down, Peter.

1570
01:48:57,663 --> 01:48:58,664
Yeah!

1571
01:48:58,747 --> 01:49:00,332
Hey, where you going?

1572
01:49:08,048 --> 01:49:09,341
-MJ.
-Hey.

1573
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:11,385
-Hey.
-Hey.

1574
01:49:11,468 --> 01:49:13,095
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. Are you okay?

1575
01:49:13,178 --> 01:49:15,597
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Is everybody else okay?

1576
01:49:15,681 --> 01:49:17,015
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1577
01:49:18,559 --> 01:49:21,144
-What happened?
-There was just the drones,

1578
01:49:21,228 --> 01:49:23,939
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1579
01:49:25,732 --> 01:49:27,276
-Was that you?
-Yeah.

1580
01:49:28,694 --> 01:49:29,695
Did you get him?

1581
01:49:32,948 --> 01:49:34,616
-Yeah.
-Well, I...

1582
01:49:36,076 --> 01:49:37,160
brought that.

1583
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:39,830
In case you needed some help.

1584
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:41,206
Thanks.

1585
01:49:43,584 --> 01:49:48,046
Anyway, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1586
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,507
I think he works for you or something.

1587
01:49:50,591 --> 01:49:52,134
He...

1588
01:49:52,217 --> 01:49:54,469
-He gave me this.
-No.

1589
01:49:54,887 --> 01:49:55,721
No.

1590
01:49:57,181 --> 01:49:58,682
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1591
01:49:58,765 --> 01:50:00,893
-I had this stupid plan.
-Peter.

1592
01:50:00,976 --> 01:50:04,479
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top--

1593
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,735
And you kissed me.

1594
01:50:09,818 --> 01:50:12,404
-What? What?
-Yeah.

1595
01:50:12,487 --> 01:50:16,867
I don't really have much luck
when it comes to getting close to people.

1596
01:50:18,994 --> 01:50:20,162
So I lied.

1597
01:50:22,122 --> 01:50:26,210
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1598
01:50:30,672 --> 01:50:32,174
That's great.

1599
01:50:33,467 --> 01:50:36,053
-Black dahlia, like the murder.
-The murder.

1600
01:50:36,136 --> 01:50:38,180
-Good.
-Yeah.

1601
01:50:38,263 --> 01:50:39,890
Sorry it's broken.

1602
01:50:39,973 --> 01:50:42,142
I actually like it better broken.

1603
01:50:44,019 --> 01:50:45,145
I really like you.

1604
01:50:46,813 --> 01:50:48,315
I really like you too.

1605
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:04,498
Okay. I should--

1606
01:51:04,581 --> 01:51:07,543
I should probably get back to the class.

1607
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:08,502
I'll go and...

1608
01:51:10,128 --> 01:51:11,672
-Yeah. I don't know.
-Okay.

1609
01:51:13,841 --> 01:51:14,967
Just in case.

1610
01:51:22,975 --> 01:51:24,434
Yeah, no.

1611
01:51:24,518 --> 01:51:27,771
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1612
01:51:27,855 --> 01:51:29,940
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1613
01:51:30,023 --> 01:51:31,316
I gotta go.

1614
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:35,821
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1615
01:51:35,904 --> 01:51:38,532
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1616
01:51:38,615 --> 01:51:40,868
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1617
01:51:40,951 --> 01:51:41,994
It worked.

1618
01:51:42,077 --> 01:51:44,830
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1619
01:51:44,913 --> 01:51:46,540
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1620
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:51,170
Where's Parker?

1621
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:52,588
He's with a girl.

1622
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:55,257
I need to speak with him.

1623
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:57,885
-He'll call you.
-He'll--?

1624
01:52:02,222 --> 01:52:04,266
Okay. Great.

1625
01:52:04,683 --> 01:52:06,143
Well, he better.

1626
01:52:06,226 --> 01:52:08,187
Or it's your ass.

1627
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:11,732
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1628
01:52:28,999 --> 01:52:30,834
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1629
01:52:30,918 --> 01:52:34,796
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1630
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,714
Ouch.

1631
01:52:36,256 --> 01:52:37,549
Except for me.

1632
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:38,967
Thanks.

1633
01:52:39,051 --> 01:52:40,761
-Don't be late.
-I won't.

1634
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:41,803
See you later.

1635
01:52:41,887 --> 01:52:44,515
-You guys are so cute.
-Thanks.

1636
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:49,853
I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1637
01:52:49,937 --> 01:52:52,523
-Oh, we broke up.
-Oh, we broke up.

1638
01:52:52,606 --> 01:52:53,941
No. What? Why?

1639
01:52:54,024 --> 01:52:56,401
Men and women grow apart,

1640
01:52:56,485 --> 01:52:59,446
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1641
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,242
-You are so wise.
-Thank you.

1642
01:53:06,578 --> 01:53:07,579
Hello, Gerald.

1643
01:53:08,914 --> 01:53:10,415
Could Mother not make it?

1644
01:53:16,922 --> 01:53:18,173
-May!
-I promise you--

1645
01:53:18,257 --> 01:53:20,509
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1646
01:53:23,011 --> 01:53:24,930
I'm so glad you're okay.

1647
01:53:25,013 --> 01:53:27,975
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1648
01:53:28,058 --> 01:53:29,935
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1649
01:53:30,018 --> 01:53:32,145
-Oh, right. They got blown up.
-Yeah.

1650
01:53:33,230 --> 01:53:35,566
-I got you some hot buttered bagels.
-Thank you so much.

1651
01:53:35,649 --> 01:53:36,567
I know my boy.

1652
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:40,028
I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.

1653
01:53:40,112 --> 01:53:41,822
I faced a lot of deception.

1654
01:53:41,905 --> 01:53:44,783
And I'm tired of the lies.

1655
01:53:44,867 --> 01:53:47,035
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1656
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,206
Are you dating?

1657
01:53:52,124 --> 01:53:53,458
-Yes.
-Not really.

1658
01:53:54,459 --> 01:53:56,253
-What?
-Well--

1659
01:53:56,336 --> 01:53:58,297
-I think--
-Summer fling.

1660
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,382
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1661
01:54:00,465 --> 01:54:03,635
-I still don't know where it's going to go.
-Open to wherever it might lead.

1662
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:05,762
-Anywhere. On or off.
-To share it with people...

1663
01:54:05,846 --> 01:54:09,766
-We'll always be friends, no matter what.
-I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1664
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:12,352
...because we all are interconnected.

1665
01:54:12,436 --> 01:54:13,562
-Bye.
-We are.

1666
01:54:32,289 --> 01:54:33,415
Sorry!

1667
01:55:10,244 --> 01:55:11,787
-Hey. Sorry I'm late.
-Hey.

1668
01:55:12,246 --> 01:55:14,206
-It's fine.
-You ready?

1669
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:15,958
-Yeah.
-You're gonna love this.

1670
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,918
Okay! Okay!

1671
01:55:18,001 --> 01:55:19,837
-Okay. Okay.
-You ready?

1672
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,131
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1673
01:55:25,133 --> 01:55:27,803
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking!

1674
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:46,942
Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1675
01:57:49,069 --> 01:57:49,987
You okay?

1676
01:57:54,032 --> 01:57:56,034
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1677
01:57:56,118 --> 01:57:58,662
Let's just-- Never, never doing that again.

1678
01:57:58,745 --> 01:58:00,455
-I'm never doing that again.
-Okay.

1679
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:02,249
I should probably get out of here.

1680
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:04,001
-Be safe.
-See you later.

1681
01:58:07,296 --> 01:58:09,339
This is breaking news.

1682
01:58:09,423 --> 01:58:12,342
We come to you with revelations
about last week's attack in London.

1683
01:58:12,426 --> 01:58:14,595
An anonymous source provided
this video.

1684
01:58:14,678 --> 01:58:19,600
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

1685
01:58:19,683 --> 01:58:21,727
A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.

1686
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:23,854
I managed to send the Elemental
through the rift,

1687
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:25,772
but I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1688
01:58:25,856 --> 01:58:27,482
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason.

1689
01:58:27,566 --> 01:58:29,860
He has an army of weaponized drones,
Stark technology.

1690
01:58:29,943 --> 01:58:33,280
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

1691
01:58:34,072 --> 01:58:36,325
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

1692
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:40,412
-There will be significant casualties.
-Do it. Execute them all.

1693
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:47,669
This shocking video was released
earlier today

1694
01:58:47,753 --> 01:58:50,797
on the controversial news website
TheDailyBugle.net.

1695
01:58:50,881 --> 01:58:54,092
There you have it, folks,
conclusive proof that Spider-Man

1696
01:58:54,176 --> 01:58:57,179
was responsible
for the murder of Mysterio,

1697
01:58:57,262 --> 01:59:00,599
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet

1698
01:59:00,682 --> 01:59:03,060
and who will no doubt go down in history

1699
01:59:03,143 --> 01:59:06,146
as the greatest superhero of all time.

1700
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,524
But that's not all, folks.

1701
01:59:08,607 --> 01:59:11,652
Here's the real blockbuster.
Brace yourselves.

1702
01:59:11,735 --> 01:59:14,780
Spider-Man's real--
Spider-Man's real name is--

1703
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:20,202
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

1704
01:59:20,911 --> 01:59:22,246
What the fu--?

1705
02:07:30,484 --> 02:07:31,777
You gotta tell him.

1706
02:07:33,862 --> 02:07:35,948
It was fine.

1707
02:07:36,031 --> 02:07:38,033
The little boy handled it.

1708
02:07:38,116 --> 02:07:39,743
We helped.

1709
02:07:39,826 --> 02:07:41,036
-Talos.
-Come off it.

1710
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:43,622
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1711
02:07:43,705 --> 02:07:46,083
I mean, that was all very convincing.

1712
02:07:46,166 --> 02:07:49,795
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1713
02:07:49,878 --> 02:07:53,090
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1714
02:07:55,425 --> 02:07:58,053
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1715
02:07:58,136 --> 02:08:01,932
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1716
02:08:02,015 --> 02:08:05,477
And it was very touching, you know?

1717
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:07,354
Really, really quite touching.

1718
02:08:07,437 --> 02:08:08,689
Talos.

1719
02:08:08,772 --> 02:08:13,068
And, you know, shortly after that,

1720
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:16,113
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

1721
02:08:16,196 --> 02:08:18,365
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

1722
02:08:18,448 --> 02:08:19,950
I don't know what to say to that,

1723
02:08:20,033 --> 02:08:21,660
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won--

1724
02:08:44,433 --> 02:08:45,976
Everybody back to work!

1725
02:08:53,442 --> 02:08:55,360
Who's got my shoes?
