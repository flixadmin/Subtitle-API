1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm just sorting my salad.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,380
I'm not on the bus anymore.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,460
Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,880
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,880
It was just a hook up.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,380
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,040
It was your boyfriend who sent the tips.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,960
My boyfriend didn't even know.
-The little blonde one. Isak?

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,560
Isn't that what he's called?

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,220
Hello! This is Isak.
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,760
But you can leave a
message after the beep.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Okay, just wait for the beep.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,720
Isak. You better answer the 
phone because I need to talk to you.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,940
Hi.
-Hi.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,940
Where's Isak?

16
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,120
Isak is a bit upset.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,960
What happened?

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,060
His dad ran away,
and his mother completely collapsed.

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Shit.

20
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,780
Yeah, it's quite shit.

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,320
But, is everything okay?

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't really know. 
His mother was already pretty crazy.

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,740
Yeah.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,780
Do you want me to fetch someone or?

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,380
Eh, no. I just wanted to talk to
him about something.

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,840
He's not answering his phone.
-I think he turned it off.

27
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,160
How are you doing?

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Good!

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,040
Or..

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,700
You know.

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,540
Yeah, I know.

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
Say hi to him.

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't you want to come in?
I'm sure he wants to see you.

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,760
No, eh. I think..

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,760
He has you, so..

36
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,060
Yeah.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Bye.

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,420
Bye.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,100
What's the symbol for porridge?

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm really struggling here.

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,820
"In the barn sits Santa with his Christmas porridge."

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,740
What's this porridge?
Porridge is porridge.

43
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,940
Why did you choose this song?
-I thought it was simple.

44
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,340
You have to hand it in next class.
-I know. And I forgot.

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,700
Porridge is the symbol of..

46
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:21,740
Life?
-Life? Fits perfectly. Life.

47
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,460
Did you do it?

48
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,060
What did you use?
-"Deilig er jorden"

49
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Isn't that a really bad song?

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,940
It has a beautiful message.

51
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,600
Fuck! Message! What's the
message in "På låven sitter nissen"?

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Vilde?

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,320
Hi!

54
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,860
Hi.

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,700
How's it going with you?
-Really good! With you guys?

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Come sit with us.

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,760
I would really love to, but me,
Sara, Ingrid, and Pepsi Max are going to the coffee place.

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,860
So.. Maybe next time?

59
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,060
How's it going with your bus?

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,780
Good.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Did you find a sponsor yet?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
Not yet.

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,460
It's just one thing. They'll come running soon.

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,660
Hi! Are you guys here?
Do you want to eat here?

65
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,820
I'll just go and get my
jacket, I'll be right back.

66
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,080
What happened just now?

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Hi.

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,300
Hi.

69
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,240
Look out when you go up the stairs.
Me?! It's you who has to look out.

70
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Okay..

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,680
How's it going with Isak?

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah, it's going better now.

73
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,660
But he's not at school.
No, he's chilling at home for a bit.

74
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,420
Call or text him. He would like that.

75
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,960
Yeah, I'll do that. I forgot.

76
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,020
What do you have now?
-French.

77
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,460
Awkward.

78
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
Jonas!

79
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,120
What are you doing?!

80
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,540
Jonas!

81
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Fuck, you have to back me up!
-You hooked up with his girl. If I were him I would've killed you.

82
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,880
Hi!

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,180
Hi.

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
How's it going?

85
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,040
Fine. Or..

86
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,180
It's going great.

87
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,480
How's it going with you?

88
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,400
It's going well.

89
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,520
I dumped Chris.

90
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,300
Did you?
-Hm-hm.

91
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,420
That's good, Iben!
-Yeah.

92
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,440
Also, I'm having a girl power 
Christmas party on Friday. You have to come.

93
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,840
Girl power Christmas party?
-Yeah, where no third year guys are invited.

94
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,800
Okay.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,720
They have too much power
at this school. All the drama is because of them.

96
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,080
Us girls have to start sticking up for each other.

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Agreed?
-Agreed.

98
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,960
So, an all girls party?

99
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,040
No, no. We need guys there.
So I thought we could invite first year guys.

100
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,100
They're the most undervalued
group at school.

101
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,980
But come on Friday! Take your friends.

102
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,020
Yeah, cool!

103
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,020
If you know any delicious
 first year guys, invite them.

104
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah, I'll try.
-Okay, good.

105
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,700
But, I was wondering..

106
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,660
Could you maybe ask Vilde if she can come?

107
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,800
Vilde?

108
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,380
Yeah, Vilde Lien.
She's a first year.

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,460
Of course. Just take her with you.

110
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,920
I think she'd be happy
if you could invite her.

111
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah, okay! I'll find her on Facebook.

112
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,480
Thanks.

113
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,760
I need water!

114
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,780
Have you heard from Vilde?

115
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,420
No.

116
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,700
Have you heard from Vilde?

117
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,420
Eh, no.

118
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,620
Iben, did you invite Vilde?

119
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,800
Yeah, she said she would come.

120
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,220
Check this on snapchat.

121
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,520
Even more first year guys!

122
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,500
Isak?

123
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,640
Hi! Eva!

124
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
How's it going with you?

125
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,380
It's going.. better.

126
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
Good.

127
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,220
How's it going with your mom now?

128
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,240
Good.. It's a lot of stress.

129
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,680
Her and dad will
surely find a solution.

130
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,880
Good.

131
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,140
So, it's going better with you now?

132
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,200
Now it's going better.

133
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,700
I have news for you.
-Yeah?

134
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,380
Me and Jonas are back together.

135
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,900
Seriously?

136
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,620
He hasn't said anything, but.. great!

137
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,380
Yeah, I know.

138
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,400
He has forgiven you and everything?

139
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,260
Yes!

140
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,700
Great!

141
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,460
So I just want to say..
Thanks so much for being there for me.

142
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
I don't know what I would've done without you.

143
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,100
I don't have many people I can trust.

144
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,420
But you're one of them. So, thanks.

145
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm just glad you guys worked it out.

146
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah. I'm happy you support us.

147
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
Team Jonas!

148
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,740
There's just one thing I'm wondering.

149
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Hm?

150
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,020
Did you also support us when
you told everyone that me and Chris hooked up?

151
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Because our relationship
went to hell after that!

152
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,220
My whole life went to hell after that!
So you have to tell me what you were thinking.

153
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,320
Because I think it's psycho.
Why did you do it?!

154
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
What were you thinking?

155
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,940
You really don't know why?

156
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,340
No, I really don't know why!

157
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,360
Think about it.

158
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,600
What? Do you have..

159
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,880
Do you have..

160
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,120
.. feelings for me?

161
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Like you didn't know?

162
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,420
No..

163
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,680
I didn't know.

164
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,580
So it's not that great for
me to have to listen to you..

165
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,740
.. talk about Jonas,
and me having to be your advisor. 

166
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,560
That's really not great for me.

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,840
Sitting there like an idiot.

168
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,360
And hoping that one day you'll know..

169
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
.. that he's not good enough for you.

170
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,980
Isak, I didn't know.

171
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,720
Honestly, Eva. How did you not understand?

172
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,460
Anyway, it's not an excuse for what you did.

173
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,700
You outed me to the whole school!
-It was stupid. I fucked up.

174
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,660
I was drunk and..

175
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,180
I was also quite mad at you.

176
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,800
I thought you used me.

177
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,840
I didn't know Chris had a 
psycho girlfriend who would create a bunch of drama.

178
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Then I wouldn't have done it.

179
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,120
Eva, come.

180
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,780
Now!

181
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,260
Eva.

182
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't..

183
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
You can't tell Jonas anything about this, okay?

184
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,660
Call an ambulance!

185
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,800
Vilde!

186
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,420
What happened?!

187
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,460
She came in, started staggering,
and then she tripped. She's not responding.

188
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,560
Is your mom home?
-No, no!

189
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,220
I think I killed William's baby tonight.
