1
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,716
We interrupt scheduled programming
to bring you this breaking news.

2
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,051
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes...

3
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,304
Kob has received
dozens of reports...

4
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,974
Of what appears to be a crashed
aircraft, possibly two aircraft...

5
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,976
On Albuquerque's east side.

6
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,770
As of yet details are scarce...

7
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,981
But callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead...

8
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,233
Followed by falling debris.
Visible now...

9
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,779
Crash investigators with the
national transportation safety board...

10
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,782
Are expected on site
as early as this evening.

11
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,949
But officials warn...

12
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,994
That with a debris field
of this magnitude, the investigation...

13
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,789
Officials are now saying
that the boeing 737...

14
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,292
Was being re-routed,
or vectored, through the airspace...

15
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,754
Which is standard procedure
according to a spokesman for the faa.

16
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,257
The eight-seat king air 350
was a charter flight...

17
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,678
Operating out of St. George, Utah,
bound for amarillo, Texas.

18
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,932
It sounded like hail,
like heavy hailstones.

19
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:12,020
It was just bump-bump-bump,
all over the neighborhood...

20
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,900
Indicating that the final death toll
now stands at 167.

21
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,862
One hundred and sixty-seven.

22
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,365
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering...

23
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,492
How such an accident
could take place...

24
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,327
In a system
with so many safeguards.

25
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,996
That the collision
which brought down flight 515...

26
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,625
Was caused
by improper air traffic control.

27
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,670
We have the bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma city...

28
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,046
As the faa confirmed...

29
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,175
It was indeed a lone
air traffic controller's fateful mistake...

30
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,969
Which brought about the crash.

31
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,848
Is Donald margo/is,
a 19-year veteran...

32
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,143
Of the faa's air route traffic
control center in Albuquerque.

33
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,022
Margolis recently returned to work
after a five-week absence...

34
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,483
Which was due to, quote,
"a personal loss".

35
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,571
While it's now known that margo/is
had recently lost a daughter to a...

36
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,239
Drug overdose a month before.

37
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,242
His troubled daughter Jane margo/is,
aged 26...

38
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,412
Apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.

39
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,913
Friends of the family say...

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,083
The death of his only child
hit margo/is particularly hard.

41
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,087
Coming as it did
little more than a month before...

42
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,090
Many are questioning
the timing of his return to work...

43
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,593
And are wondering
how much blame truly lies...

44
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,053
With those
who let this grieving father...

45
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,711
I usually open with
"so sorry you're here."

46
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,005
Where would you like to begin?

47
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,216
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

48
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:33,221
As quick as something like this
can be. So...

49
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:38,893
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

50
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,312
Does he know?

51
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,233
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

52
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,901
Has he moved out?

53
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,195
We're in the process
of moving him out.

54
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,572
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

55
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,743
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

56
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,661
And I are staying with my sister.

57
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,540
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

58
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,001
Only so he could
get his things and...

59
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,088
That was supposed to happen last
week, but then came the crash and...

60
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,174
Oh, god, you weren't one of the...?

61
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,260
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

62
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:18,767
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighborhood, so...

63
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,770
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even...

64
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,939
You know, parts of bodies.

65
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,778
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

66
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,946
- So awful.
- I know.

67
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,450
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

68
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:40,538
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

69
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,292
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

70
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,213
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

71
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,631
Two children, you said?

72
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:56,596
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

73
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,935
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

74
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,146
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

75
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,066
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

76
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,486
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage...?

77
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,616
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

78
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,661
What about other debts or assets?

79
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,913
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

80
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,415
Of you and your husband's
financial situation?

81
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,755
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

82
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,176
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

83
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,681
- Or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

84
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:44,185
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

85
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,523
Of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

86
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,694
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

87
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,950
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

88
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,191
Walt?

89
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,193
Hey, buddy?

90
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,998
Hey, Walt?

91
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,375
- Hey.
- There you are.

92
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,420
Listen, I... you know, well...

93
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,923
It's...

94
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,925
It's time.

95
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,350
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Barnone.

96
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,435
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

97
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,853
I speak with authority...

98
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,731
Because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

99
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,107
But this here? I mean...

100
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,444
Call freaking guinness book
of world records, call freaking...

101
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,947
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

102
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,117
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

103
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,787
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

104
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,081
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

105
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,083
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

106
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,627
You beat a little tactical retreat...

107
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,214
You regroup, and then:

108
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:41,594
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

109
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,810
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

110
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,443
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

111
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,487
I got it.

112
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,574
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

113
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,247
Half a million in cash.

114
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,796
That's the spirit.

115
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,302
I got it, I got it.

116
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,616
Who's here for self-improvement?

117
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,038
Come on, give me a show of hands.

118
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:57,211
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

119
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:06,220
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

120
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,891
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

121
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,734
Hey, honey,
you want another waffle?

122
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,698
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

123
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,954
Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn
and Holly. Please leave us a message.

124
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,375
Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.

125
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,918
I was just checking in...

126
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,713
And thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.

127
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,174
You certainly
can always reach me on my cell...

128
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,512
I've always got that on me,
but in terms of a mailing address...

129
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,764
I'm here at the beachcomber...

130
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,434
And you know what,
it's actually very nice, very pleasant.

131
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,187
Not as high-end as the oakwood,
but not as corporate...

132
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,858
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, dad, it's me.

133
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,194
No, I'm not okay.

134
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,029
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,115
Nobody's telling me jackshit
around here.

136
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,409
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

137
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,369
I don't even care anymore.

138
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,955
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

139
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:19,377
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

140
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,713
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

141
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,052
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

142
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,082
Okay.

143
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,968
May I have your attention, please?

144
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,889
As all of you know, last week
our city suffered a terrible tragedy.

145
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,891
One that none of us will ever forget.

146
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,728
Which is why today we 're going to
take a little time out of our schedule...

147
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,564
To gather in the gym and talk.

148
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:11,239
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

149
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:17,078
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

150
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,123
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

151
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,379
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

152
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,258
Like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever...

153
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,387
It's basically an automatic a
for you.

154
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,099
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

155
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,935
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

156
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,728
Who wants to go next?

157
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,359
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

158
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,156
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

159
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,203
There you go, honey.

160
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,541
I just keep asking myself...

161
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,794
Honey, could you please stand up?

162
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,589
Thank you.

163
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,259
I just keep asking myself,
"why did this happen?"

164
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,762
I mean, if there's a god and all...

165
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,474
Why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

166
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,978
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

167
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,773
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

168
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,234
Does anyone else have that?

169
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,282
I just keep hearing that sound.

170
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,583
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

171
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,839
Thank you, sweetheart.

172
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,968
- Is there anyone else?
- Over here.

173
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,769
My neighbor, he heard the crash...

174
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,023
And he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

175
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,317
Like an airline seat.

176
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,194
Like what you have on an airliner?

177
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:18,032
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

178
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,870
Right next to his sea-doos,
because, like, he has sea-doos.

179
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,500
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

180
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,960
Human legs.

181
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,631
Jesus h. Christ.

182
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,679
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

183
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,015
I was just moved.

184
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,143
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

185
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,524
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

186
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,652
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

187
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,823
And by the way, welcome back.

188
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,668
It's so good to have you back.

189
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,355
I guess what I would... sorry, sorry.

190
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,737
I guess what I would wanna say is...

191
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,742
To look on the bright side.

192
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,622
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

193
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,249
And that...

194
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,920
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban center?

195
00:20:55,087 --> 00:21:00,885
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

196
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,305
Plus, neither plane was full.

197
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:10,978
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

198
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,564
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

199
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:18,277
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

200
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,490
Is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

201
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,659
Actually, tied for 50th.

202
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,662
There are, in truth...

203
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:34,168
53 crashes throughout history...

204
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,631
That are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

205
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,802
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of tenerife? No?

206
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,140
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...

207
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,851
Crashed into each other on tenerife.

208
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,022
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

209
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,443
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

210
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,948
Nearly 600 people died on tenerife.

211
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:09,703
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

212
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:16,043
You know why?
It's because people move on.

213
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,379
They just move on.

214
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,132
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

215
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:29,056
Because that is what
human beings do, we survive, and...

216
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:34,812
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

217
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,191
We survive. We survive and...

218
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,820
- Okay?
- Thank you.

219
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey, how's your aunt Marie doing?

220
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,988
Fine. I guess.

221
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,742
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

222
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,912
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

223
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,874
No, I...

224
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:49,898
http://hiqve.com/

225
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,452
He's gone.

226
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,583
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

227
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,795
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

228
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,713
How are you?

229
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,092
Why you gotta treat him like this?

230
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,760
Why you gotta be like this?

231
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:39,473
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

232
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,196
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

233
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,120
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

234
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:06,959
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

235
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:12,464
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

236
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,260
He's probably wondering, "what is it
that could have gone so wrong...

237
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,138
- Marie. Marie.
- That my mother would leave...?"

238
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,098
I can't help you get through this...

239
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,351
You know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did?

240
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,021
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

241
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,692
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

242
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,819
- That would be really great...
- "Prying"

243
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:38,031
- and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

244
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,792
It's that voice inside your head.

245
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,840
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24/7 voice.

246
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,551
You know what I'm talking about.

247
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,554
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

248
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,725
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

249
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,144
President of the United States?

250
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,647
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

251
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,524
But now...

252
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,529
Are you good enough to deserve
your share of basic human happiness?

253
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:22,701
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

254
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,078
I say yes.

255
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,418
But it doesn't matter what I say.

256
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,755
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

257
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,926
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

258
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,930
Jesse, we never hear from you.

259
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,936
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

260
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,606
Just come on. Let us in on it.

261
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,742
So, like, what makes you the expert?

262
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,620
I don't think I ever said I was that.

263
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,456
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

264
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:16,463
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

265
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,050
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

266
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,430
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

267
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:31,478
But did you ever really
hurt someone?

268
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,984
I killed my daughter.

269
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,452
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

270
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,999
July 18th, 1992.

271
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,836
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

272
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,299
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

273
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,967
I had plenty left.

274
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,761
But I was out of vodka.

275
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,847
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

276
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,309
Where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

277
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,269
They have these abc stores...

278
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:18,400
Which close at 5 P.M.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

279
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,487
So I'm arguing with my wife.

280
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,491
"Come on. Go to the abc for me,
it's my birthday.

281
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,204
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."

282
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,624
And she's saying "no, no."

283
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:40,672
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so ijump in my truck.

284
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,344
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

285
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,681
She's playing
at the end of the driveway.

286
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,152
How do you not hate yourself?

287
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,406
I did hate myself for a long time.

288
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,536
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

289
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,414
It just made it that much worse.

290
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,088
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

291
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,924
It just stands in the way.

292
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,219
Stands in the way of what?

293
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,763
True change.

294
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,003
Skyler.

295
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,381
Is this a good time to talk?

296
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,135
Yeah. Come in. Please.

297
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,767
Skyler.

298
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,248
Do you wanna start?

299
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,509
Okay.

300
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,783
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

301
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,038
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

302
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,502
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

303
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:29,674
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

304
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,728
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

305
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,236
Would you even consider...?
I mean, Jesus!

306
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,906
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face...

307
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,078
When there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

308
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,249
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

309
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,209
You haven't heard any of it at all.

310
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,545
You're a drug dealer.

311
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:14,761
No. What...? How...? What?

312
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,444
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

313
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,412
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

314
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,801
Oh, my god, Walt.

315
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,722
Cocaine?

316
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,561
It's methamphetamine.

317
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:11,901
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

318
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,323
."Perse.

319
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,118
It doesn't mean... no, Skyler!

320
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,829
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

321
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,458
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

322
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,630
So please, let's... please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

323
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,591
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

324
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:39,512
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

325
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,598
Nobody will hear it from me.

326
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,518
But only if you Grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

327
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,271
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

328
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,983
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

329
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,002
Bye, Jesse.

330
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,855
Your windshield's broken.

331
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,744
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

332
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,914
Strictly temporary. We're just...

333
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,333
We're just taking a little break.

334
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,088
That's you, over there.

335
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,926
Listen, money.

336
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,555
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

337
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,598
I'm better.

338
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,936
You're better? Really?

339
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:16,443
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

340
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,739
That's excellent. That's...

341
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,745
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

342
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:33,710
You know,
in spite of how bad things got...

343
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:38,465
It really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

344
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:43,636
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

345
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,974
And on the straight and narrow.

346
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,730
You been following
this airplane crash?

347
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,946
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

348
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,157
Because he was so torn up?

349
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,577
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

350
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,288
You are not responsible for this.

351
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,625
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

352
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:18,171
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

353
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,300
And there are many factors
at play there.

354
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,927
Yeah?

355
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:29,307
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

356
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,184
That may not have been working.

357
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,520
That's public record.
You can look that up.

358
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,357
And the whole system
is run on 19603 technology.

359
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,030
No, really, I blame the government.

360
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:50,703
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

361
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,791
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

362
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,546
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

363
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,674
I accept who I am.

364
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,133
And who are you?

365
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,971
I'm the bad guy.

366
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,949
Here's some napkins for you.

367
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,076
Enjoy.

368
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,500
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

369
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,211
It's good to see you again.

370
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,466
- May I?
- Please.

371
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,601
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

372
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,482
I actually am not here to...

373
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:09,782
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

374
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,535
To tell you this personally.

375
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,414
I'm done.

376
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,502
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

377
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,797
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

378
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,300
And I appreciate
the way you do business.

379
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,972
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

380
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:38,770
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads...

381
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:44,651
And it's brought me
to a realization.

382
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,530
I am not a criminal.

383
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,452
No offense to any people who are...

384
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,334
But this is not me.

385
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,631
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

386
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,843
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

387
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:15,306
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

388
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,437
Three months, then out.

389
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,320
Three million?

390
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,701
May I take this as a "yes"?

391
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:48,131
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

392
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,885
What I don't have is my family.

393
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,181
The answer is still no.

394
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,231
Enjoy your meal.

395
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,822
Thank you.

396
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,148
That's it!

397
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,192
Did you feel it?

398
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,861
Texas!

399
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,280
I've made this trip three times...

400
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,408
And every time
there's three big bumps...

401
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,202
And that's how you know!

402
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,788
We are officially in Texas!

403
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,130
This time I got a job waiting for me.

404
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,426
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

405
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,053
Yo, that's for me, homes!

406
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,183
They call me "olive oil" because
I paint them slick.

407
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:28,064
I do pearlescent, color-shift,
you name it.

408
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,818
I painted cars for some of...

409
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,320
The biggest gangsters in michoacan.

410
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,699
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

411
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,121
Not much good for working, but...

412
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,749
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...

413
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,116
What the hell's going on in there?

414
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
