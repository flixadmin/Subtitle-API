1
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,901
Increased intellectual activity.

2
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,175
Stress level's rising.

3
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,281
- What's the problem?
- I can't be certain yet.

4
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,948
Give me audio contact.

5
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:03,993
Pull the trigger, Alpha.

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,869
<i>Pull the trigger now.</i>
<i>That's a direct order.</i>

7
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,175
L...

8
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,844
Damn it.

9
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,810
All right, close it down.

10
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,817
This is Dr. Rossick.
The training exercise is now terminated.

11
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,791
Will that be all, Dr. Rossick?

12
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,661
Yeah, Frank. Thanks a lot.

13
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,357
What happened?

14
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,504
Well, I think she was confused by
the moral decision she was forced to make.

15
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,040
"Moral decision"?
What the hell are you talking about?

16
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,676
Alpha can make choices.
Sometimes they bewilder her.

17
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,838
I don't want her to make choices.
I want her to take orders...

18
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,279
...and kill who I tell her to kill.

19
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,909
You see, that's just the point.
You asked her to commit murder.

20
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,888
Rossick, she is supposed to be
the ultimate covert assassin.

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,655
This project cost $30 million,
and you're telling me it doesn't work.

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,526
Calm down, Powers.
She'll just take a little fine-tuning.

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,793
We'll be operational
by the end of the week.

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,561
You had better be.

25
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,668
All right, everybody, just leave her
in the lab and you can go.

26
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,832
We'll start over in the morning.

27
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,881
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.

28
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,853
Ernest, I've forgotten my briefcase.
I'll be right back.

29
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,291
Alpha?

30
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,564
What are you doing out here?

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,877
This is Dr. Rossick.
We've got a level-four emergency.

32
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,880
Alpha One has just escaped.
She may be armed.

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,211
And she is definitely dangerous.

34
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,952
- Apocalypse Wow?
- It's a new club that just opened up.

35
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,023
Sabrina's throwing a charity bash there.
It's gonna be wild.

36
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,715
- You gotta come.
- I don't know.

37
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,327
It doesn't sound like my kind of place,
you know?

38
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,760
- Can't I just make a donation?
- No.

39
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,491
- I haven't even got a date.
- It's no problem.

40
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,728
I called up Tina. You're supposed
to pick her up at Star Labs at 8.

41
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,499
- What, are you my social director now?
- Hey, somebody's gotta do it.

42
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,239
- Well, we can stop by for a few minutes.
- Great.

43
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:17,179
Do me a favor, though.
Try and dress a little hip, all right?

44
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,158
It's party time.

45
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,462
Barry, you look like an undertaker.

46
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,831
Thank you. Listen, Tina,
I'm sure you're just as excited...

47
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,102
...about this evening as I am...

48
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,406
...so we'll just stay long enough
to make Julio and Sabrina happy...

49
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,744
...then sneak out the back, all right?
- You're gonna hate me...

50
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,318
...but I can't come.
- What?

51
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,785
I'm sorry, but my experiment's
gone wrong.

52
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,550
- So you'll do it again tomorrow.
- No, Barry, I can't.

53
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,354
No, I am not gonna leap
into disco inferno alone.

54
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,555
Barry, I can't. I have to do
the experiment tonight, finish the report...

55
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,100
...and have it on the review committee's
desk by 9 a.m. In the morning.

56
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,329
Believe me, I'd rather come out with you
than work all night.

57
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,201
Yeah, right.

58
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,036
What are all these old research papers
doing out?

59
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,142
I'm leaving now.
Is there anything else you need?

60
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,512
Oh, no, thank you. Oh, Alpha,
this is Barry Allen, a friend of mine.

61
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,212
Barry, this is Alpha Webster. She just
started as our new lab assistant.

62
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,381
Alpha, that's an unusual name.

63
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,022
They call me Alpha
because I was the first.

64
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,358
- The first child in your family.
- In a way.

65
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,563
Do you know what these are doing out?

66
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,863
I'm sorry, I was trying
to organize your files.

67
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,529
That's okay, I have my own
filing system, thank you.

68
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,073
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

69
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,040
- Good night.
- Bye.

70
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,072
Don't you think you should be going?
It's nearly 8:00.

71
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,579
Wait.

72
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,649
Hey, what about Alpha?

73
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,787
- Do you think she's free tonight?
- That is not a good idea.

74
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,319
- Why not?
- She's very bright...

75
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,754
...but a bit damp in the personality
department. All business.

76
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,759
I know you're gonna meet
a lot of beautiful young women there.

77
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,592
No one with less than 12 earrings
or more than a monosyllable.

78
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,994
Well, here's mine for the evening:

79
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,694
- Out!
- All right.

80
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,000
Really, it's greatly appreciated.
We won't forget it. Thank you.

81
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,842
Sorry.

82
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,336
Come on, man.

83
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,777
Thank you. Thank you.

84
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,455
Barry!

85
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,463
Hey, don't you know that black is out
as a fashion statement?

86
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,662
Haven't you heard? It's back in, man.
Yeah, very, very in.

87
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,602
- Where's Tina?
- She couldn't make it.

88
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,039
Introduce yourself to the bartender.
Tell him you're a friend of mine.

89
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,441
He'll point out all the available chicks.

90
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,775
- Money for the homeless.
- Is that good or bad?

91
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:37,938
Come on!

92
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,888
There she is.

93
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,990
There's too many people
on this street.

94
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,656
We'll let her get around the corner
before closing in.

95
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,598
We don't wanna cause a scene.

96
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,838
Where'd she go? She go inside?

97
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,233
- Sorry.
- Hey. Alpha, right?

98
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,103
- And you're Barry Allen.
- You have a good memory.

99
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,767
Listen, why don't we go
try to grab a seat, huh?

100
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,005
- All right.
- All right.

101
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,474
Excuse me.

102
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,847
What do you think the odds are of us
running into each other tonight?

103
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,717
Two million seven hundred and eighteen
thousand four hundred and fifty to one...

104
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,451
...based on the most recent
population of Central City.

105
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,527
Wow, you really do have a memory.

106
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,995
I've memorized the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>
<i>Britannica</i>, <i>Webster's Dictionary</i>...

107
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,966
...the complete works of William
Shakespeare and 613 other books.

108
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,195
- You're not serious.
- Yes.

109
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,502
Where I used to live, after everyone left,
I'd stay up all night and read books.

110
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,736
- Trouble sleeping, huh?
- No. I don't need to.

111
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,440
- At all?
- No. It's such a waste of time.

112
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,650
Oh, here. Quick, grab these.

113
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,480
There we go.

114
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,281
One night I read a book
about the Civil War.

115
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,758
Did you know that Abraham Lincoln
freed all the slaves?

116
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,591
- Well, I heard a rumor.
- That's when I realized...

117
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,893
...I didn't want anyone telling me
what to do or locking me up.

118
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,362
I wanted to make my own choices.

119
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,401
I mean, if people can be free,
why can't I?

120
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,741
- Right.
- It's all for a good cause, folks.

121
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,901
So dig deep. Remember,
the more it hurts, the more it helps.

122
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,048
Thank you, sir. Very kind.
Oh, very generous of you. Thank you.

123
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,117
Help the homeless. Thank you, sir.

124
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,679
Oh, thank you, sir.

125
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,951
- Thank you, sir.
- Would you excuse me?

126
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,355
- I see an old friend.
- Thank you very much.

127
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,924
Thank you.
Something for the homeless?

128
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,094
- That's the best you can do?
- Hello, Fosnight.

129
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,495
Hey, Allen. Sharp threads.

130
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,604
Didn't anybody tell you
that black is out?

131
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,135
- You care to make a little donation?
- To whom?

132
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,899
The old hustlers' home?

133
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,873
Excuse me, miss.
Would you make sure...

134
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,878
...the committee chairman gets this?
Thank you.

135
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,446
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't run you in.

136
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,587
- Hello.
- Hello.

137
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,518
Look, Barry, you let me go,
and I'll owe you one. A big one.

138
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,217
You know my marker's as good as gold.

139
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,720
All right,
but this is the last time, okay?

140
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,457
- Next time I have to book you.
- You won't regret it.

141
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,601
Anytime you need anything,
give me a call.

142
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,363
The same thing goes for you, honey.
Any friend of Barry's is a friend of mine.

143
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,836
<i>Ciao</i>.

144
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,265
What are they doing?

145
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,808
I have no idea.

146
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,405
- I can't keep up with all the new dances.
- Looks like fun. Come on.

147
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,607
Well, actually I'm no good at...

148
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,078
- I like this.
- Where did you learn to do that?

149
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,013
- Are you a professional dancer?
- I've never danced before.

150
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,515
What?

151
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,303
Help for the homeless?

152
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,840
What, are you kidding? Come on.

153
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,089
There she is.

154
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,035
Let's go.

155
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,515
Move! Go!

156
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,708
Move! Out of the way.

157
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,896
Alpha!

158
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,896
- Are you in trouble?
- It's just that...

159
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,467
- All right. Time to come home.
- What's going on here?

160
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,695
Stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

161
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,330
- Hey, buddy. I happen to be a cop.
- You want to stay healthy? Back off.

162
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,773
- Don't make this difficult.
- I don't want to go.

163
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,275
It's not up to you.

164
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,219
Come on!

165
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,756
Hey!

166
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,664
Don't shoot!

167
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,890
- Who are you?
- I'm not telling you squat.

168
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,092
"National Scientific Intelligence Agency."

169
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,193
I've never heard of you.
What's going on here?

170
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,328
This is government business, pal.
You better cut me loose right now.

171
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,305
I don't think so.

172
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,572
We can get her address
from her application...

173
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,308
...but if the NSIA's involved,
she's in serious trouble.

174
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,714
- Who are they?
- They're a top-secret government...

175
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,052
Someone's jimmied the security system.

176
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,550
Barry, what is that?

177
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,846
Come out, Alpha.

178
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,558
- You've been shot.
- I'm all right.

179
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,337
What are you?

180
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,951
This is incredible. A synthetic humanoid
with artificial intelligence.

181
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,053
Who created you?

182
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:33,122
I was built as part of a secret project
by the NSIA.

183
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,489
My name isn't Alpha Webster.
It's Alpha One:

184
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,859
Artificial Lifelike Prototype Humanoid
Android One.

185
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,027
I got the name Webster
from the dictionary.

186
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,835
What are you doing here?

187
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,072
I ran away.

188
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:55,243
The purpose of the project was
to create robot intelligence agents.

189
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,941
Androids that could be programmed
to kill particular targets.

190
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,245
The theory was that droids are stronger
and smarter than humans...

191
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,651
...and virtually unstoppable.

192
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,460
Only, I was created
with the ability to make decisions...

193
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,028
...and I decided I didn't want to kill.
I wanted to be free.

194
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,027
So those people who are after you...

195
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,360
Want to take me back
and reprogram me.

196
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,260
Why did you come to Star Labs?
Why apply for a job here?

197
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,598
Part of me was designed
by you, Dr. McGee.

198
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,243
- That's impossible.
- Three years ago, you worked...

199
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,814
...with Dr. Jason Rossick
on a robotics project for the government.

200
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,012
That's right.

201
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,279
The idea was to build robotic limbs
for handicapped people.

202
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,514
There were problems,
and I left the project.

203
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,955
Last year, Dr. Rossick went to work
for the NSIA.

204
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,028
He's the one that designed
and built me.

205
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,293
- Alpha, may I take an x-ray of you?
- Of course.

206
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,165
I'd like to see what they've
done to my work.

207
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,972
Okay, just lie on the scanning table
so I can record your image.

208
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,019
You still haven't told us
why you're here.

209
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,717
Because there are certain circuits
inside me that I want to alter...

210
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,826
...and I need to access
Dr. McGee's research.

211
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,928
What circuits?

212
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,360
Someone's at the main entrance.

213
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,231
- Yes?
- <i>Dr. McGee.</i>

214
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,341
<i>Colonel Powers, NSIA. I have</i>
<i>a federal warrant to search the premises.</i>

215
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,410
- Powers? What do you want?
- <i>This is a matter of national security.</i>

216
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,276
<i>Either you open this door,</i>
<i>or we break it down.</i>

217
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,209
Wait a minute. I'm working on
an experiment with toxic chemicals.

218
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,651
I have to make sure the lab's
not contaminated.

219
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,149
<i>You've got 10 seconds.</i>

220
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,620
What has Christine Powers
got to do with this?

221
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,128
She's in charge of the project
that developed me.

222
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,391
- Do you know her?
- Unfortunately.

223
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,367
She was the NSIA coordinator on a
project I worked on with Jason Rossick.

224
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,736
She's ruthless, cold and dangerous.
She's the reason I left the robotics project.

225
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,470
She wants to take me back and erase
my memory circuits. It'll be as if I die.

226
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,342
We're not gonna let that happen.
You've gotta let them in.

227
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,246
- They have a federal warrant.
- Hide in the storage room.

228
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,951
Let's go.

229
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,563
Search the building.

230
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,294
Well, well, Dr. McGee.
It's been a while.

231
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,200
Not long enough, Powers.

232
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,737
- What's back there?
- A storage room.

233
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,078
- I'll check it out.
- I demand to know what this is all about!

234
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,151
We're looking for a woman
named Alpha.

235
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,318
We know she just started working here.
We also know...

236
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,581
...you were with her earlier this evening.

237
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,784
You were seen dancing together
in a club.

238
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,930
As far as I know, dancing's no threat
to national security.

239
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,588
If you know where she is,
you'd better tell me now.

240
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,827
- We can't help you.
- What's your interest in her anyway?

241
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,733
- We want to talk to her.
- I remember how you talk to people.

242
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,638
As I recall, your way of asking questions
needs some social refinement.

243
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,336
I don't have to justify myself
to you or to anybody.

244
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,448
There's nobody back there.

245
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,141
I've got a word of advice
for you, McGee:

246
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,811
- Stay away from me on this one.
- It's clear back there too.

247
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,616
Let's move out.

248
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,699
She's gone.
Must've climbed out a window.

249
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,397
Barry, whoever or whatever she is,
she needs our help.

250
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,408
I know. I'll search the streets.

251
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,684
Hey, hey, check it out.

252
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,218
Hey, old man.

253
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,881
Okay.

254
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,719
Out kind of late, ain't you, grandpa?

255
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,054
Look, fellas, I just want...

256
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,426
Now give me your wallet, and maybe
I won't slice you up like a loaf of bread!

257
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,364
I don't have any money.

258
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,368
- Too bad.
- Let him go.

259
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,101
Look at this.

260
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,912
I think I'm in love.

261
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,314
- I don't wanna fight you.
- Who said anything about fighting?

262
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,654
Come on, honey.

263
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,465
Thanks.

264
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,205
Cops.

265
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,436
We'd better not let them find us here.
Look, I got a place nearby.

266
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,207
This used to be a nice neighborhood.

267
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,820
Man, those punks really clipped me good.

268
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,923
I'm sure glad you came along, kid.

269
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,424
- What are these?
- Cards.

270
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,757
You know, poker, blackjack, like that.

271
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,464
Where you from,
the center of the Earth?

272
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,233
Cards.

273
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,808
You ever hear of three-card monte?

274
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,174
You got any money?

275
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,280
Figures.

276
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,613
Okay, look.
That's the queen of hearts.

277
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,515
Watch.

278
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,287
Find the queen.

279
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,659
Beginner's luck.

280
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,526
Let's try again.

281
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,172
Okay.

282
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,247
- How'd you do that?
- My optical circuits are equipped...

283
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,282
...with x-ray vision.
- Yeah, right.

284
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,612
Look, kid, if you got x-ray eyes...

285
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,791
...what color undershorts am I wearing?

286
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,327
Red.

287
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,233
Look, I gotta go out for a little while.

288
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,202
You make yourself at home, okay?
And don't go anyplace.

289
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,181
I've been all over the city.
I can't find a sign of her.

290
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,824
I found something.

291
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,256
I've been studying Alpha's x-ray.
It's incredible.

292
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,955
Electronically, biomechanically,
she's a miracle. Except for this.

293
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,361
- What is it?
- It's a ball of plastic explosive...

294
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,230
...in the middle of her memory circuits.
- A bomb.

295
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,812
- What's it doing there?
- I think it's a self-destruct device.

296
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,110
If anything goes wrong,
she could be destroyed.

297
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,618
She was here trying to find
a way to disconnect it.

298
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,723
If Powers thinks she'll lose Alpha,
she may press the button.

299
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,519
A bomb like this could kill
a lot of people, Barry.

300
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,022
Tina McGee.

301
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,698
- It's for you.
- Me?

302
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,959
- Hello.
- It's Fosnight.

303
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,366
- I been calling all over trying to find you.
- What's so important?

304
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,233
I told you I owed you one. You know
that skirt you were with at the club?

305
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,171
Yeah, I can't find her anywhere.

306
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,745
Yeah, well, she's with me.
And there's something weird about her.

307
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,779
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- <i>My apartment.</i>

308
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,418
<i>912 Stone Avenue.</i>
<i>I'll meet you out front.</i>

309
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,281
I'm on my way.

310
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,252
We've got a location.
I need an ETA on Omega's arrival.

311
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:00,429
<i>Sergeant Powers, Dr. Rossick and Omega</i>
<i>left about 15 minutes ago.</i>

312
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,033
<i>They should be in Central City</i>
<i>within the hour.</i>

313
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,429
Good.

314
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,676
- You made good time.
- Where is she?

315
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,540
Down here.

316
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,553
Alpha, Tina and I want to help.

317
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,018
- We know about the bomb inside you.
- Bomb? Did I hear "bomb"?

318
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,957
- That's why you came to Star Labs, right?
- Yes.

319
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,994
You were trying to disconnect it.

320
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,224
But it's wired directly
into my memory circuits.

321
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,893
And if the bomb's not removed properly,
it'll detonate.

322
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,595
Excuse me.

323
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,365
Detonate?

324
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,669
Allen, what the hell's going on here?

325
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,969
Fosnight, Alpha's...

326
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,808
...not exactly what she seems.

327
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,246
- She's a robot.
- A robot?

328
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,951
Yeah.

329
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,286
No, no, that's gears and levers
and built like a ringer washer.

330
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,222
- Alpha's built like a...
- Woman. That's the idea.

331
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,228
Listen, come back to Star Labs
with me, all right?

332
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,432
I know I'm human...

333
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,529
...but trust me.

334
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,295
- All right.
- Okay.

335
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,503
- Thanks, Fosnight.
- Yeah, sure.

336
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,443
No, it's...

337
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,977
You humans are very strange creatures.

338
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,949
The more I learn from you,
the more you puzzle me.

339
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,145
- In what way?
- You have the greatest gift...

340
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,383
...the universe has to offer, life,
and yet all you seem to do...

341
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,959
...is complain and argue and fight
with each other.

342
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,431
Barry!

343
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,131
It paralyzes the nervous system.

344
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:51,300
Don't make us hurt you, Alpha. We just
wanna reconstruct some of your circuits.

345
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,704
Take me back and make me a machine?

346
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,278
- You are a machine.
- No.

347
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:02,045
- I'm alive. I'm a woman, just like you.
- I hardly think so, Alpha.

348
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,518
Why did you make me this way?

349
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:08,022
Why did you make me feel
and think and respond?

350
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,855
We can discuss this
back at the lab with Dr. Rossick.

351
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,429
- I'm not going with you.
- Listen to me, Alpha.

352
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,368
You're expensive equipment.
We'd rather have you back in one piece.

353
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,163
But if you walk away from me,
I will push this button...

354
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,774
...and you will be nothing more
than a handful of nuts and bolts.

355
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,705
Run!

356
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,077
Stop her!

357
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,190
Let's get him inside for questioning.

358
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,624
The residual effects of the paralysis
should wear off in about an hour.

359
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,738
- Did you find Alpha?
- No, but Omega's here.

360
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,203
Good.

361
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,813
Let me introduce the next generation
in our android series:

362
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,482
Omega.

363
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,847
Faster, stronger, smarter.

364
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,285
And he lacks the annoying habit
of making his own decisions.

365
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,721
Powers, I protest.

366
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,723
Omega isn't ready to be field-tested yet.

367
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,394
Yes, well, you're not running
this project, Dr. Rossick. I am.

368
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,126
And unless you'd like
to be reassigned to Antarctica...

369
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,532
...I suggest you cooperate.

370
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,640
Omega, find Alpha...

371
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,577
...and bring her back.

372
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,338
I'm always fascinated at how pliable
and fragile the human psyche is.

373
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,440
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It's some kind of a seizure.

374
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,614
- His heart's racing like a train.
- Look, help me lift him up.

375
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,808
We can't have him dying
till he tells us what we need to know.

376
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,509
Hurry.

377
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,996
This should help you burn the drug
out of your system.

378
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,595
Thanks. Now I've gotta find Alpha
before Powers and her men do.

379
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,709
Well, if another android can track her,
she must have a signal we can lock on to.

380
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,641
The problem is how to isolate it.

381
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,452
Fosnight, I'm glad you're here.

382
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,082
I needed to borrow your tools to make
an adjustment in my optical circuit.

383
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,990
Oh, my God!

384
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,654
Allen was on the square.
You are a damn machine.

385
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,322
Please don't be frightened.

386
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,333
I'm not. It's just so...

387
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,505
- Better?
- Yeah, better.

388
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,668
So...

389
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,334
...who are these people that are after you?
- They work for the government.

390
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,313
Hey, say no more. Anybody being chased
by the feds is okay in my book.

391
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,214
Look, you gotta get out of town, kid,
and fast.

392
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,116
- You got a car?
- No.

393
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,723
- And no money either, right?
- No.

394
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,626
All right, we gotta figure out a way
to get you some cash real quick.

395
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,127
I got it.

396
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,096
You know that trick
where you see through the cards?

397
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,098
- Could you do that again?
- Of course.

398
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,936
My emergency fund.

399
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,770
You pulled me out of a real jam,
so I figure I owe you.

400
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,539
- I don't understand.
- You will.

401
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,650
You ever hear of something called poker?
Let me tell you all about it.

402
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,715
Cards. Remember these?

403
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,952
There's 52 of them in a deck.
There's four suits:

404
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,993
Clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.

405
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,235
Gentlemen, the name of the game
is five-card stud.

406
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,540
Let's play cards.

407
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,078
It's Fosnight. I gotta talk to Joey C.

408
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,483
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you got an empty chair at the table?

409
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,156
Come on. You're a little out of
your tax bracket, Fosnight. Deal them.

410
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,724
Actually, it's a friend who wants to play.

411
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,163
Well, as long as he's got you
for a reference.

412
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,098
Vernon, are the cards stuck together?

413
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,775
Her name is Alpha.

414
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,247
A very wise man once said
that poker should not be played...

415
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,780
...with women in the house.

416
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,408
- Vernon, are your fingers busted, or what?
- Get modern, Joey.

417
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,385
Or you afraid
maybe she'll flatten your wallet?

418
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,583
Hey, I don't mind taking money
from a broad. Sit down, sweetheart.

419
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,467
Gold's 100, blue's 500, green's a grand.
How many you want?

420
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,970
- That's all you got?
- That's all she'll need.

421
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,811
Deal the lady in, Vernon.

422
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,552
Fosnight, you're making me
very nervous.

423
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,227
There it is!

424
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,833
A faint radioactive trace
from Alpha's power source.

425
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,492
Where is she?

426
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,184
- Hotel Infantino. I'm on my way.
- Barry, wait!

427
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,951
I'm getting another signal.
Identical to Alpha's.

428
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,362
It's Omega.

429
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,498
He's closing in on her.

430
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,840
Three nines.

431
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,510
Just a minute.

432
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,580
That's the eighth hand in a row
that you've won.

433
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,941
Do you know what the odds are
against that?

434
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,643
If you give me the data,
I can calculate them for you.

435
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,151
- What?
- Relax, Joey.

436
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,290
- It's a friendly game.
- I'm being friendly.

437
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,051
I just wanna know how come
she manages to win every hand.

438
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,559
I can see through the cards.

439
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,463
What?

440
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,598
You have two kings...

441
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,429
...an ace, a jack and a four.

442
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,201
She's a good guesser.

443
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,670
Come on, Joey, it's just a little joke.
It's a gag, that's all!

444
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,648
- Is there something wrong?
- Nothing a little cement couldn't cure.

445
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,048
Answer that.

446
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,820
I'll take care of this worm.

447
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,832
- Alpha, I'm here to take you back.
- I don't wanna go.

448
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,351
I'm taking you back.

449
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,925
No, you're not.

450
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,483
- Police! Nobody move!
- Look! It's the Flash!

451
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,193
Come on! Come on!

452
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,440
What the hell is going on here?

453
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,750
Okay. Let's do this one more time.

454
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,091
- You are not a human being?
- That's right. I'm an android.

455
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,992
- A what?
- An android?

456
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,032
A synthetic human,
like in all those stories by Isaac Asimov?

457
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,397
Yes. You read Asimov too?

458
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,199
- Oh, I love Asimov.
- Bellows, do you mind?

459
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,801
- You're a robot?
- Just like the one you found in the hotel.

460
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,075
That was some kind
of goofy mannequin without a head.

461
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,843
- It was a robot too?
- Yes.

462
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,919
And I'm the Tin Woodsman,
and this is Munchkinland.

463
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,546
Bellows, call County General
and ask them to send over a psychiatrist.

464
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,226
How about a mechanic?
Maybe she's just a quart low.

465
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,625
- Lieutenant, she's telling the truth.
- Allen.

466
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,723
What do you know about all this?

467
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,631
That she's exactly what she told you,
an android created by the government.

468
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,172
She escaped because she doesn't want
to be used as a weapon.

469
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,402
I think you better tell me the whole story.
From the beginning.

470
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,570
That won't be necessary.
Lieutenant, I'm Colonel Powers, NSIA.

471
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,206
I have a federal warrant remanding
this woman into my custody.

472
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,843
I think you'll find everything's in order.

473
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,683
You can't turn her over.
They wanna reprogram her.

474
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,087
There's nothing I can do.
It's a federal warrant.

475
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,024
- It's the same thing as murder.
- Stay out of this, Allen.

476
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,629
- All right, Alpha.
- No, I won't go!

477
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,833
Alpha!

478
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,401
We know your destruct frequency.
We have another transmitter.

479
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,767
- You're coming with us.
- Let's go.

480
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,141
Let me make something clear, Powers.

481
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,874
I don't like government-intelligence
types or the way you walk over the law.

482
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,448
You or your people so much as commit
a traffic violation...

483
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,920
...on the way out of my city,
I'll throw you in jail! You understand?

484
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,425
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, lieutenant.

485
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,833
Come on.

486
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,871
You should have seen her eyes
when they were taking her away.

487
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,342
It was like watching a person
who knew she was going to die.

488
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,413
Barry, we've got to do something.

489
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,073
Legally, Alpha may be government
property, but I know she's alive.

490
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,516
She has feelings, emotions.

491
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:47,385
They're just gonna kill her.
We can't just stand by.

492
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,460
It's not that easy, Tina. They're
holding her inside an NSIA facility.

493
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,826
They've got more security than Fort Knox.
Even I can't get past it.

494
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,730
Maybe you could...

495
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,802
...with a little help.

496
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:12,410
First, we have to isolate
the decision-making circuits...

497
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,310
...and then, disconnect them.

498
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,652
This should be a good place
to tap into their system.

499
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,960
You were right. They've got
an incredible security system:

500
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:32,000
Electrified fences, mines, laser beams.
You're never gonna get through that.

501
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,864
Then what do we do?

502
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,769
Maybe I can penetrate
their security computer.

503
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,702
The problem is in the decision-making
circuits of the main memory core.

504
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,814
What we have to do is eliminate them.

505
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,644
And then we can reprogram the memory...

506
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:51,151
...using the newer,
updated Omega version.

507
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,527
I'm in!

508
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,393
Tina, you're beautiful.

509
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,932
It's about time you noticed.

510
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,196
Now let's see if we can make them
think they're being invaded.

511
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,711
This is Powers. What's the problem?

512
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,874
<i>Yeah, we've got an intruder showing</i>
<i>on the grid in Sector Four...</i>

513
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,918
<i>... but according to security,</i>
<i>there's no one there.</i>

514
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,885
Check the system.

515
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,458
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

516
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,889
How do you know what I feel?

517
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,062
- This is Powers. What's the problem?
- <i>Same problem, ma'am.</i>

518
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,230
<i>We've got an intruder</i>
<i>in Sector Seven...</i>

519
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:48,071
- <i>... but our patrols don't see anything.</i>
- Get the damn thing fixed.

520
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,514
First, we have to isolate
the decision-making circuits...

521
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,084
...and then, disconnect them.

522
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,349
- This had better be good.
- <i>We've got alarms going off all over.</i>

523
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,122
<i>According to the computer,</i>
<i>we're being invaded!</i>

524
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,426
Look, obviously there's something
faulty in your security system.

525
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,731
I don't wanna be disturbed anymore.
Do you understand? Shut it down.

526
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,733
- They turned it off.
- I knew you could do it.

527
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,717
It'll take them about three minutes
to find they've been penetrated.

528
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,717
I'll be back in two.

529
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,564
All right.

530
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,758
We've isolated
the decision-making circuit.

531
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,063
Run the memory-erase program.

532
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,073
- Hello.
- Hello.

533
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,481
Hey!

534
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,379
This is Powers. The Flash
has penetrated the facility.

535
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,991
I want you to reactivate all the
security systems. I want him stopped.

536
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,456
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am. They've</i>
<i>already made it through Gate Four.</i>

537
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,967
Tina, can you access their security files?

538
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,263
- I think so.
- Erase them.

539
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,112
- Oh, my God.
- What?

540
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,088
All of our research files.

541
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,529
Somebody's deleting them.

542
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,460
Damn them.

543
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,932
Powers! No!

544
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,736
Powers, stop it! Look!

545
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:06,308
If you destroy Alpha, you'll kill everybody
within 50 yards of her!

546
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,382
Yes, I know.

547
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,353
- Oh, no.
- Alpha, what's wrong?

548
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,991
The self-destruct mechanism.
It's been triggered.

549
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,719
There'll be another signal
in 30 seconds to detonate it.

550
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,522
- God!
- I've gotta get out of here...

551
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,665
...or you'll both be killed.
- Wait!

552
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,063
Tina, what's the range
of the destruct signal?

553
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,398
I'm not sure. Ten miles, maybe more.

554
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,437
- We'll have to chance it.
- Chance what?

555
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,303
Outrunning it.

556
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,457
- The countdown's been negated.
- Yeah?

557
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,253
You outran the signal.

558
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,137
I spoke to a friend of mine
at Star Labs East.

559
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,708
She found you a position
in the Research Department.

560
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,937
She'll also protect your true identity.

561
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,581
And Rossick and Powers
will be too busy explaining...

562
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,684
...how they lost eight years of data
to come after you.

563
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,481
Do you think it's wise to let Fosnight
take Alpha to the airport?

564
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:57,354
- Sure, he's grown very attached to her.
- Yeah, that's what worries me.

565
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,428
Hey, Allen. McGee.

566
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,657
- I got your plane ticket. You all set, kid?
- Yes.

567
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,302
Thank you for everything you've done.

568
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,506
- You've given me my life.
- It's a pleasure.

569
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,080
There are advantages to being an android,
but sometimes I wish I was human.

570
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,343
You ain't the only one, stretch.

571
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,384
Look, maybe we better get a move on.

572
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,581
Fosnight, I think you've made
a mistake with my ticket.

573
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,625
- What do you mean?
- My x-ray circuits can see it...

574
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,024
...in your pocket,
and it doesn't say New York.

575
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,494
Let me see that.

576
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,796
Las Vegas.

577
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,235
- Two tickets.
- Hey, it's just a little detour. So sue me.

578
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,007
Dr. McGee, I believe we'll all be taking
a little trip to the airport.

579
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,439
Please don't be too hard on him, Barry.
He can't fight his nature.

580
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,048
- Told you so.
- Alpha, you're a real piece of work.

581
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,741
Thank you.

582
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,152
I can't wait to meet
next year's model.

583
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,446
