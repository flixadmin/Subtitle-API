Don't come near me.

Why are you here if you don't wanna talk?

Put the gun down, Alice.

ALICE: You're evil.

Leave me alone or I'll kill you!

Thank you.

I'm sane?

00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,091
Absolutely, 100%. I examined you myself.

And the murder of Miss Kringle?

You're still thinking
about your meeting with Jim?

677
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,641
No, there's nothing left to say.
It's all in the past now.

678
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,227
It's been less than a year,
I think there's plenty to say.

679
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,997
After all you went through with him,

680
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,898
I just need to know
that nothing's left unsaid.

681
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,737
Well, you should
speak to him yourself, then.

682
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,817
I did.

683
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,233
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

684
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,824
Something you could have mentioned
the moment we sat down. When? How?

685
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,506
It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.

- He came into the ER, he needed stitches.
- Of course.

687
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,043
So I took the opportunity
to introduce myself.

688
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:17,048
He didn't make the connection at first
because you hadn't told him my name.

689
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,968
It never came up.

When Mario was born,

I promised my wife
that he would never be part of our thing.

697
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,872
That we'd raise him to lead
a good, honest life.

And we did.

And he has.

but he's brought true honor to the family.

You're exactly the kind of woman
she would have wished for her son.

Thank you.

There's only one thing
that would have worried her.
