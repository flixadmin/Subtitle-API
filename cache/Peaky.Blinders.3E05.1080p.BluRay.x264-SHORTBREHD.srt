1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,084
<i>Where do you keep these things? Bank?</i>

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,645
We have our own treasury.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,767
<i>Wine cellar.</i>

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,041
And a tunnel under the river.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,090
My guess is they've turned
one of their cellars into a strong room.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,286
Did you find someone, Arthur?

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,483
Stefan Radischevsky.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,920
- And he speaks Russian?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,721
He works in the house for four weeks
and keeps his ears open. All right?

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,007
I have a bright future too.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,246
Mapped out.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,205
But you wanna try things first.

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,327
<i>- Michael...</i>

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,288
<i>Why does a pen pusher
who sits on his arse all day</i>

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,044
<i>want to fire a gun?</i>

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,687
There is going to be a vacancy
in Shelby Company, Limited.

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,330
No revolvers. All legal.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,006
<i>Get me a meeting with someone
from the Soviet embassy...</i>

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,047
He was in the war.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,968
He was in a tunnel collapse.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,726
He won medals...

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,566
<i>Take care of him...</i>

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,965
Here he is, Mr Shelby.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,171
Thank you, nurse.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,561
Tommy.

27
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,408
I need to speak to you about the priest.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,681
- I know things about him.
- Hmm.

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,529
From when I was a...
From when I was a boy.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,566
I will shoot him myself, Tommy.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,245
Just teach me how to shoot.

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,481
It's easy, Michael.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,843
Just point and pull the trigger.

34
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
He asked for me today, Mary.

35
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Not his mother.

36
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,406
For the first time...

37
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,961
He missed you...

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,843
Where is he? Is he in the kitchen?

39
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,450
Yes, he's with the girls and johnny.

40
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,921
Oh.

41
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,285
Did you remember your medicine, sir?

42
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,608
Did you ever read the Bible, Mary?

43
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,087
Sometimes.

44
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,286
Do you ever read it out loud
while standing naked next to my bed?

45
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,884
'Cause when I take the morphine
the doctor gave me, that's what you do.

46
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,606
I'm wide awake,

47
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,883
but you are standing there
naked, plain as day,

48
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,043
reading from the Book of Leviticus.

49
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,410
Do you want to know what happens next?

50
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,487
No.

51
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,887
Neither do I.

52
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,290
That's why I poured the medicine away.

53
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,926
Go and get johnny, Mary.

54
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,881
That's it.

55
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,126
Without the firing pins,
the guns won't work.

56
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,566
And there are no replacements?

57
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,644
They don't make these any more.
These are the end of the line.

58
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,046
Yeah, we had the foreman
take out all the spares.

59
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,726
If we take the pins,
they'll never fire a shot.

60
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,881
And nobody will know

61
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,086
until they unload the bloody things
in Tbilisi.

62
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,845
Or until they are facing our guns
at Kutaisi.

63
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,445
Take them all out and give them to me.

64
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,250
Oh, come on, boys, no fucking about.

65
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,924
And I will tell the Soviet ambassador

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,082
that there is no longer a need
to blow up the train.

67
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,401
And I'll tell Tommy
you accept his plan.

68
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,764
You know,
some mornings I wake up,

69
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,003
I think I've died
and this is heaven, Tom.

70
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,969
I mean, the wives and kids
camped out by the valley, huh?

71
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,491
And not being moved on.

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,648
Sure, me, meself, I'm surrounded
by maids and food and booze.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
See that line, there?

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,047
No.

75
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,205
It's the edge of heaven.

76
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,446
The border
between Birmingham and paradise.

77
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
And today, my friend,

78
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,364
you are going to step over that line,

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
back into the world.

80
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,600
You mean, you have something
for me to do, Tom.

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,331
Have you ever heard
of Hampton Court Palace, johnny?

82
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,930
No. I can't say I have.

83
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,524
You and three families of the Lees
are going to set up camp

84
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,728
100 yards from the gate of the palace.

85
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,130
You won't be moved on
because I have just bought the land.

86
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,368
You will be joined
by some old friends of mine,

87
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,444
who are going to open a hole
underneath your tents and caravans.

88
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,244
You see this blow to the head
you took, Tom...

89
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,006
And for allowing for the hole to be dug,
you will get £5,000,

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,321
which you will split
between the three Lee families.

91
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,323
I take a lot of this money is
to do with not asking questions, Tommy?

92
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,161
Dead right, johnny.

93
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,925
And when the hole is filled in again,

94
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,485
you can go back to paradise.

95
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,125
Mr Shelby,
your brothers are here.

96
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,927
And there is someone who described
himself as "the wandering Jew".

97
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,887
Will you take the Jewish gentleman
to the drawing room

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,923
and take my brothers to the kitchen
and give them tea and rum?

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,001
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,724
Good morning, Mr Solomons.

101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,487
Yeah, it is.

102
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,642
Nice little place
you've got here, Thomas.

103
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,801
What is it?

104
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,971
A foreclosure of the gambling debt
from some poor, young lord

105
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,249
who you pumped full of opium
in one of your casinos,

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,049
or is that just tittle tattle?

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,641
Drink?

108
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,565
Nah, I don't touch it, mate.

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,405
Your housekeeper said
you're not allowed to drink.

110
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,487
Eh?

111
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,771
She said you are suffering from so many
ancient injuries from your sporting life

112
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,923
that your head is like
some sort of smashed vase

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,162
what has been stuck back together
by a horse.

114
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,601
Now.

115
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,283
Word in London is that you can be

116
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,522
found wandering
the streets of Birmingham,

117
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,887
stark naked, throwing away money.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,490
You talk to dead people.

119
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,886
Also that you believe
that you are powerful enough

120
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,048
to summon up Jews

121
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,088
of a very particular standing,

122
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,410
up to the gentile wilderness
wherein you live

123
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,324
and order for them to do
your fucking bidding, mate.

124
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,411
Yet, still you came.

125
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,882
Yeah, well, you know...
I was passing, weren't I?

126
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,886
Do you know something, Alfie?

127
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,087
This morning, I tried to read the paper
and I realised

128
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,964
that the only consequence
of my terrible accident

129
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,004
is that I now need glasses.

130
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,321
Right...

131
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,641
All right, well.

132
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,131
I know a man who can make you
a pair of these.

133
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,330
Now, he's a magician, mate.

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,326
He's a magician.

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,566
So not only will you be able
to read your newspaper

136
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,730
but you will also be able
to see into the future.

137
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,324
Now I know this, right, because he
made this pair here for me.

138
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,364
So you don't have to worry
about telling me what this is all about

139
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,887
because I have already seen it.

140
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,685
You're fucking about with the Russians,
ain't you, you silly boy?

141
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,769
You've got two choices, Michael.

142
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,844
You fuck off to America with Arthur and
join the Apaches, or you marry the girl.

143
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,410
This isn't a joke.

144
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,165
Arthur, are you really going to live
with the Apaches?

145
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,001
- Has she told her father yet?
- No.

146
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,730
He'll fucking shoot you, man.

147
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,165
Are you sure the kid is yours?

148
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,890
I wish I hadn't told you.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,209
Then think of marriage
as a beautiful road...

150
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,402
Flowers all the way down it.

151
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,926
- Is he joking?
- It's hard to tell these days.

152
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,845
Do you, er...

153
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,091
Do you love the woman?

154
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,566
Fucking what?

155
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,330
Well, then go and marry her
like the rest of us.

156
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,841
She doesn't want her family to know.

157
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,485
And she doesn't want to have the baby.

158
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,561
We know a woman.

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,251
- Shut up, John.
- Same woman who helped you out, twice.

160
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,885
- They weren't my women.
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,964
That's why you had them fixed, Arthur.

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,686
Charlotte will want the best...

163
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,405
- She is the best.
- "The best."

164
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,086
Used to be a nurse.
Twenty minutes. Done.

165
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,731
And you don't have to go to in
or wait outside.

166
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,326
You go to the Garrison.

167
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,364
Drink whisky. Have a laugh.

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,166
Remember, John?

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,846
And then this kid walks in, no shoes on,
says, "it's done".

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,885
Second time we was in there.

171
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,961
Same kid, this time he is wearing
shiny new shoes.

172
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,889
- And he shouts, "It's done, Arthur."
- And what?

173
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,970
She bought new shoes

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,611
with the money I gave her.

175
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,971
It was for a good cause.

176
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,561
Arthur?

177
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,968
If you are going to get on
like this with the Apaches,

178
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,405
they'd fucking scalp you, boy.

179
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,369
Tommy said when that bell rings
we've to all go to the big room.

180
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,840
Come on.
Tommy has a plan.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,001
Arthur.

182
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,570
- Arthur.
- Arthur, come here.

183
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,362
Shalom.

184
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,367
Arthur, shalom.

185
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,002
- Alfie.
- Shalom...

186
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,885
Come here. Come on. Listen...

187
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,042
I owe you a little something, don't I?

188
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,724
I do. Come on.

189
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,121
Sit down.

190
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,131
Come on, sit down here.

191
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,601
There you go.

192
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,681
Right.

193
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,001
Listen.

194
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,841
Arthur.

195
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,524
I want you to know, right,

196
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,083
that whatever happened
between us, yeah? Back then...

197
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,448
That was business.

198
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,649
It was just business.
All right?

199
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,728
And I also want you to know

200
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,282
that I have made my apologies

201
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,687
via my own God
for abusing a very holy day

202
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,208
to get you clinked up and battered,
which I did.

203
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,689
And, now, I would also like to extend
my personal apologies unto you.

204
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,201
All right?

205
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,282
I hear that you have allowed Jesus
to come into your life.

206
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,481
Eh...

207
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,411
Oh, you heard then.

208
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,369
Yeah. That is beautiful.
That is wonderful.

209
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,771
That is lovely, isn't it?

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,126
That is lovely.

211
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,885
But I was wondering,
how does that work for you

212
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,566
on a day-to-day considering
your line of work, mate?

213
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,085
Your apology's accepted.

214
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,600
'Cause I hear
you're a right fucking nuisance with it.

215
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,450
Hello...

216
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,450
Listen, all I am saying is that,
every man, he craves certainty.

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,368
He craves the certainty, even if
that certainty of yours, right...

218
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,970
Well, I mean...

219
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,691
It's fucking fanciful mate, innit?

220
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,925
Eh?

221
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,561
I'm Old Testament.

222
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,847
Fucking hell. Look at that. Now, that...

223
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,608
That scares me more...

224
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,361
Yeah.

225
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,524
Congratulations, Tommy.

226
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,683
You now have the finished article
right here, don't you?

227
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,569
See, that man, right? He will murder
and maim for you with God on his side.

228
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,325
Yeah.

229
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,448
You don't want to let him go.

230
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,810
If we're gonna do business
with this fucker,

231
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,609
I demand to know why.

232
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,450
Right...

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,729
While I was in the hospital,

234
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,329
I formulated a plan.

235
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,130
And this is how it is going to work.

236
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,486
So the Russians cannot be trusted
to pay us.

237
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,087
We are going to take what is ours.

238
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,129
We need to see
what's in their treasury.

239
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,571
And that is why we need Mr Solomons.

240
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,242
Right, boys, just remember
they are fucking insane...

241
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,404
And dangerous...

242
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,642
And drunk on stuff we've never heard of.

243
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,125
And they're worse than us
for spirits and ghosts.

244
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,284
And, today, they're going to test us.

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,246
Fuck them.

246
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,810
The Russians
all turned and ran.

247
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,682
The Cossacks didn't run, Arthur.

248
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,402
Mr Shelby. Welcome.

249
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,807
How is my car?

250
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,564
I think I am in love with it.

251
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,205
And I yours.

252
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,728
So we should keep what we love, yes?

253
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,041
Excuse the reception,

254
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,805
whenever we open the treasury,
the Cossacks are on guard...

255
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,763
<i>In Russia,
men On the other side of the law</i>

256
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,202
<i>decorate their body in tattoos.</i>

257
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,521
- Nice.
- Right...

258
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,923
Now, some of these tattoos
are proof of allegiance

259
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,289
to underground organisations,

260
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,525
which are the sworn enemies
of the royal household.

261
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,846
So it is customary
in Russian royal households

262
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,289
to check for such tattoos
before engaging a man in business.

263
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,763
And as we approach the allotted day

264
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,490
these ladies here
would like to make sure

265
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,564
that you are
not assassins or infiltrators, so...

266
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,766
No, we're all good.

267
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,444
So they'd like to check your skin.

268
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,444
They want to check our skin?

269
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,041
Yeah.

270
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,724
Now my body has already been checked,

271
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,770
although, at the time,
I wasn't sure that was the reason.

272
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,811
And now it's your turn.

273
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,360
Well then, boys.

274
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,370
Take your clothes off.

275
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,126
Fuck off.

276
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,522
No. No. No. No. No...

277
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,761
Obey.

278
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,011
Obey, Arthur.

279
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,444
No, I won't be obeying nobody.
Get out of my way.

280
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,726
Arthur. Come here...

281
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,041
Eh?

282
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,929
Come on, Arthur.

283
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,407
Shut up, John.

284
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,522
I will have a maid
gather the buttons and sew them back on.

285
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,967
Hmm.

286
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,289
All right. Fuck it.

287
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,930
There you go, ladies.

288
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,010
Made in fucking Birmingham.

289
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,007
All right, I think
we've seen enough, eh?

290
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,806
Tatiana.

291
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,891
Your face, Arthur, is a fucking picture.

292
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,522
Sometimes assassins hide
their allegiances behind their balls.

293
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,164
You pass the test, soldier.

294
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,291
With flying colours.

295
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,731
You see?

296
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,289
He wants to be a good man.

297
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,001
But there, now.

298
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,291
There.

299
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,161
Inside every man there is a devil...

300
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,206
The real diamonds, eh?

301
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,208
It is traditional to seal
the successful examination

302
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,761
with vodka and music...

303
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,246
Holy fuck, Tom. What was that?

304
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,527
Well done, boys. Eh?

305
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,524
Well done, Arthur.

306
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,969
Now you know what you have to do next.

307
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,011
All right?

308
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,005
One last job.

309
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,890
Make contact and play nice.

310
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,010
Give me five minutes.

311
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,320
I brought Michael because, as
chief accountant, he has to be witness.

312
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,284
Ada, can I use your phone?

313
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,566
Michael.

314
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,811
Business first.

315
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,042
Michael, stop looking at your watch.

316
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,962
Ada, whilst you are reading this,
can I go and use your phone?

317
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,530
Who's the lucky girl, Michael?

318
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,206
Her name is Charlotte
and Michael cannot breathe

319
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,647
if he does not talk to her
every two hours...

320
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,051
Ada, please...

321
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,242
Phone's in the hall.
Dial nought for the line.

322
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,401
Thank you.

323
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,050
And keep it quick, I pay the bill.

324
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,167
I will.

325
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,765
Not for long.

326
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,406
Think about it, Pol.

327
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,124
Together, we can take control.

328
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,211
With two of us in the company,
we can straighten things out.

329
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,520
What about the politics?

330
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,400
You and me, fighting together
and winning, that is politics.

331
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,369
That is a new kind of politics.

332
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,085
It's just this way, I get paid
and Karl gets a nice Christmas.

333
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,241
Good.

334
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,209
Welcome to the bourgeoisie.

335
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,285
My name is Smith.

336
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,721
My girlfriend is pregnant.

337
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,805
And, er...

338
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,245
We'd like you to help us.

339
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,610
We need to fix a date...

340
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,521
Welcome to Shelby Company, Limited.

341
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,487
Shelby Company, Limited.

342
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,927
Limited and unarmed.

343
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,085
Michael, would you like to welcome Ada,

344
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,766
our new head of property
and acquisitions.

345
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,080
Congratulations.

346
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,169
Where do I sign?

347
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,929
Ada, have you got, erm, whisky?

348
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,289
Yeah, Tommy.

349
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,886
I've already told him.

350
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,164
He's becoming too like his cousin.

351
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,890
I thought that was the idea.

352
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,611
Yeah, Tommy but with a bit more
fucking charm and class.

353
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,681
Yeah.

354
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,091
That'll help.

355
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,367
Yep.

356
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,601
Where am I sleeping, Ada?

357
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,648
- Michael...
- In the room next to Karl's...

358
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,767
Michael...

359
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,888
Good night!

360
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,327
Oh, heartbroken, poor love.

361
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,165
So how shall we celebrate?

362
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,521
Well, with Michael in bed, I thought
I might, erm, go for a little drive.

363
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,082
Drive?
Where are you going to drive?

364
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,041
Polly?

365
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,246
Things have begun to develop

366
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,482
with the man
who is painting my portrait.

367
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,686
Polly?

368
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,410
It's when you stand there in the dress,

369
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,009
you just find yourself talking
about every little thing.

370
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,286
And have you...

371
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,521
- No.
- Hmm?

372
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,884
Not yet.

373
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,681
But he called me two nights ago
to say that the portrait was finished

374
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,967
and I said I'd go there in the morning.

375
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,442
But he said no.
He wanted me there tonight.

376
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,400
Ada, you don't breathe
a fucking word of this to the boys...

377
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,490
- Okay, but is he nice to you?
- No, no. I mean it, Ada.

378
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,041
Is he rich?

379
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,090
His friends write the papers, Ada.

380
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,288
Tommy would try and close him down.

381
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,688
So go.

382
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,728
He's like a tiny bird pecking at you.

383
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,162
And I think he's given up on me.

384
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,049
So bloody go.

385
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,451
Why should the boys have all the fun?

386
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
More vodka.

387
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,121
Wait there.

388
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,770
You're doing good, Stefan.

389
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,046
It's a fucking madhouse.

390
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,561
Yeah, I know.

391
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,443
The prince wants me to suck his cock.

392
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,043
And how much do you need to say yes?

393
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,125
That's on top of the day rate
for the arse slaps.

394
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
When am I out of here?

395
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,761
Soon.

396
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,562
So what you got?

397
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,963
The strong room is not guarded at night,

398
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,411
but they said they will kill
the three brothers in the <i>"uglya dvor".</i>

399
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,845
Coal yard.

400
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,283
The duke was talking about using a sword

401
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,125
but the woman, she was talking about
using machine guns.

402
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,728
It's a fucking madhouse, John.

403
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,688
We're doing up your pub in Nechells.

404
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,366
It looks a treat.

405
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,168
Keep your fucking head up,
Peaky boy, eh?

406
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,769
Fucking madhouse, man.

407
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,889
We are almost there.

408
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,331
This way.

409
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,367
This treasury was built
200 years ago

410
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,001
to protect the king’s jewels
in case of French invasion.

411
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,246
We are now underneath
the River Thames.

412
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,845
Your jeweller.

413
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,447
I don't think they trust me, Tommy.

414
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,211
Mr Solomons is the only jeweller
I trust in London.

415
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,203
Yes. "Trust". Yes.

416
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,563
Might have to add that
on the old invoice.

417
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,051
Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,646
As we agreed, your jeweller
will now select items

419
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,485
to a total value of £70,000.

420
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,370
When you have selected
your chosen items,

421
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,681
they will be put into a box and stored.

422
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,250
When you have fulfilled
your part of the deal,

423
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,766
the box will be delivered to you.

424
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,011
May I just start, right, by saying
that I may choose to stay here

425
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,687
and just starve to death
and choke on sapphires

426
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,445
and never go back
to the fucking world again.

427
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,811
Yeah, well, there is a good reason
for that, you know, little man.

428
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,009
Because my shop, all right,
is just above a rum house.

429
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,246
- So...
- You speak Russian?

430
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,651
I do, yeah. I do.

431
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,250
'Cause of me mum.

432
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,450
Yeah, my mother.

433
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,688
You people, all right?

434
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,242
You hunted my mum

435
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,324
with dogs through the snow.

436
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,321
Yeah.

437
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,685
But today, right,
is for forgiveness, innit?

438
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,729
For selection.

439
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,807
So... Now... Hello!

440
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,641
Right, I think it is fair to say,
yeah, £1,500?

441
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,040
Fifteen hundred.

442
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,248
Mmm, yeah,
I will give you £1,800.

443
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,609
I know the current
market value. Eighteen it is.

444
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,564
That's very gracious of you.

445
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,491
Right then. How about...
Let's have a look at this.

446
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,680
This is a nice little bit
you got there, innit?

447
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,843
Oh, but that was a gift
from Tsar Nicholas.

448
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,491
I ain't asking you though, am I?
I ain't asking you.

449
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,084
All right. I come here to do business,
offer my professional services.

450
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,288
If you keep interrupting me,
I won't be able to focus.

451
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,521
Do you understand?

452
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,807
Mr Romanov, let me remind you

453
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,645
we were told to come here
and choose what we like

454
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,685
and now we have chosen.

455
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,969
Tsar Nicholas gave you that.
I will give you four.

456
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,646
Five, with the royal provenance.

457
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,606
Done.

458
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,411
All right, Rumplestiltskin,
let's go over here

459
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,881
and have a look what's in these boxes.

460
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,965
Two...

461
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,451
That is much nicer, 10.

462
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,722
And that there,
that was definitely a five.

463
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,689
- You keeping schtum?
- Yes, I am.

464
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,200
Yeah, another five.

465
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,087
- Seven!
- Six...

466
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,321
Let's call it six, eh?

467
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,244
Beauty. Look at that.

468
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,084
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- That is splendid.

469
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,128
- Splendid, yes.
- Beautiful. Is it not?

470
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,804
- It is.
- It is a work of art.

471
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,962
- You recognise this work, do you?
- Immediately.

472
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,011
I'm guessing, right, that all the bad
ideas around here, they're you.

473
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,242
Right, they are you, aren't they, hmm?

474
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,007
How do you mean?

475
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,401
Yeah. Er, Tommy, see this, right?

476
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,448
It's got paste in it.
That's paste.

477
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,931
Let me tell you something, son.

478
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,522
Somebody comes into my shop
with some paste like this...

479
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,128
Usually, what I make them do, right...

480
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,244
Is fucking swallow it.

481
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,007
Eh? What game are you playing?

482
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,962
- Eh?
- Mr Solomons...

483
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,680
Shall we, er...

484
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,967
- Shall we clean it up?
- Be careful.

485
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,685
Eh?

486
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,401
Hmm?

487
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,484
Yeah.

488
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,690
Yeah.
Right, what have we got?

489
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,483
Thirty seven thousand, six hundred.

490
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,001
Mmm.

491
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Oh, well...

492
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,281
Do you have any eggs?
Excuse me.

493
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,205
I am simply asking...

494
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,362
Fabergé is not part of the deal.

495
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,088
We would not offer you Fabergé eggs...

496
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,811
My jeweller here,

497
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,851
he advises me to insist on Fabergé.

498
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,441
It's a deal-breaker, Tommy.

499
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,161
Oh...

500
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,887
I brought that from Crimea myself.

501
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,049
Fucking hell...

502
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,090
With the provenance of that being laid
by such a delicate beauty,

503
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,969
that does indeed bring us
the entire selection to £70,000.

504
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,127
Here.

505
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,881
Good man.

506
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,691
And now, Mr Shelby,
you will join your brothers

507
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,161
and Mr Solomons will take his leave.

508
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,810
I demand absolute honesty.

509
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,642
- Oh, sorry, can I?
- I insist.

510
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,761
There.

511
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,526
A woman of style and substance.

512
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,247
I am a student of silence.
Is this a good silence or a bad silence?

513
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,805
It's good.

514
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,366
It's good.

515
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,091
- It's very good.
- No. It's still wet.

516
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,128
I know it isn't saying much
in the grand scheme of things

517
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,771
but this is the best work
I've ever done.

518
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,249
I'll miss Sundays.

519
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,648
There will be more Sundays.

520
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,011
Sorry.

521
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,490
Sorry, can you not do that, please?

522
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,688
- Can you just not do that, please?
- I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.

523
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,484
- It's all right. It's...
- I am sorry.

524
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,005
Vodka!

525
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,561
I sewed your buttons back on.

526
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,649
I wanted to see if I did a good job.

527
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,444
Yeah, you did.

528
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,284
You did a good job.

529
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,961
Sir?

530
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,881
No, I didn't.

531
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,331
My aunt
only employs the best whores.

532
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,489
How did you feel when I held him?

533
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,204
You were jealous.

534
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,050
You wanted to kill me.

535
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,162
Or him. No?

536
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,210
Why do you play games with people

537
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,089
when there is no benefit to you?

538
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,606
In Russia, because we were bored.

539
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,844
In England, because
we don't know how to stop.

540
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,331
At least they are silly games
and orgasms.

541
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,600
So let's fuck.

542
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,683
- Here?
- No.

543
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,406
Oh... In a darker place.

544
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,687
You still love her, don't you?

545
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,320
You want her?

546
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,008
Why would you fucking say that?

547
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,248
- Why would you fucking say it?
- Tommy...

548
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,169
- You love her.
- What are you fucking saying?

549
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,408
You want her? You want her?

550
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,966
Who the fuck are you, eh?

551
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,681
Huh?

552
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,488
What are you fucking saying?

553
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,645
You want her? Tonight?

554
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,051
Watch...

555
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,523
In the palace in Tbilisi,
there was a priest.

556
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,166
And he would put his hands here.

557
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,482
And with that strangulation,
there was also ecstasy.

558
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,722
It's called Khlysty.
A Siberian prayer.

559
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,688
You're almost hungover.

560
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,804
- You are almost dead.
- But in that moment...

561
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,329
Women who had lost men
in the war would lay down

562
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,290
and they would fuck the ghost.

563
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,088
You want her?

564
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,049
You want her, don't you?

565
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,330
You want her!

566
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,605
Now, you should drink this.

567
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,804
- It's holy water.
- Get the fuck away from me.

568
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,241
There.

569
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,086
I opened up another treasury for you.

570
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,442
You should call this painting...

571
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,325
<i>Fuck Them All.</i>

572
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,445
1 will.

573
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,641
The parish...

574
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,165
The king.

575
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,885
The copper.

576
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,567
Yeah, the copper in particular.

577
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,608
Do you want to hear the
wildest story of them all?

578
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,281
Yes.

579
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,522
I killed a policeman.
In cold blood.

580
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,165
With a gun.

581
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,926
Really?

582
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,165
She did it.

583
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,644
I tell you what.

584
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,085
I tell you what, I swear at one point...

585
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,968
At one point, I looked down
at the top of her head

586
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,611
and I thought she was going to
pull me cock off in her hand

587
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,523
and fucking throw it out of the window.

588
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,124
Oh, she sucked me dry, I swear to God.

589
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,051
Like fucking spud water at the end...

590
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,642
We've had worse nights...

591
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,925
You're quiet, Arthur, eh?

592
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,047
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,804
- Fuck off.
- How was your night, brother?

594
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,486
- You got all your buttons back, eh?
- Yeah, all right.

595
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,403
Yeah, what's God going to
say about it, Arthur, eh?

596
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,005
Fuck off, both of ya.

597
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,128
He tells Linda everything.

598
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,646
Every single thing.

599
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,166
Yeah, well, we'll see...

600
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,806
We're going to miss you when
you're gone now, Arthur.

601
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,762
Just drive the fucking car.

602
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,643
Private Letso reporting
for duty, Sergeant Major.

603
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,364
At ease, Private.

604
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,931
Good to see you.

605
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,365
Seven left. Out of 50.

606
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,963
Should I get them tea?

607
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,166
Get 'em beer.

608
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,811
They used to run on it
like cars on petrol.

609
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,723
Give them the black country stuff.

610
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,007
It's in the barrel with the tack.

611
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,762
They're going to fucking clean me out.

612
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,362
Whatever they take,
they'll put back.

613
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,647
Good men.

614
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,165
John, Arthur.

615
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,250
You remember these boys.

616
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,608
Well, if it ain't the Tipton
Fucking Clay Kickers, eh?

617
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,322
- Clay Kickers.
- Come here, you.

618
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,408
- How are ya? Good to see ya.
- How are ya?

619
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,330
- Nice.
- Good to see ya.

620
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,525
And this is William Letso.

621
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,762
From the South African
Native Labour Corps.

622
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,003
Sent to Flanders from the
Bloemfontein diamond mines.

623
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,131
And the best tunneller I ever met.

624
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,407
So, there's three cellars
underneath the house.

625
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,482
Wine, kitchen and septic.

626
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,523
There's a tunnel here that runs

627
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,082
from the house underneath the river
to an underground strong room.

628
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,731
Now, this used to be
the palace treasury.

629
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,802
The tunnel runs directly west

630
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,770
and it's separated from
the house by three iron doors

631
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,683
with locks we can't open.

632
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,801
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

633
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,487
Primrose Hill 23. Ada Thorne.

634
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,121
Ada?

635
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,563
Is Michael still there?

636
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,965
Right, would you tell him
that I have taken the car?

637
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,883
He can take the train.

638
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,809
And try and find out why
he's been so bloody sour lately.

639
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,362
You shouldn't go looking through
other people's private things.

640
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,851
He's my son.

641
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,091
The bullet was mine.
I never got a chance to fire it.

642
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,642
And the gypsy rules
say it must be passed on...

643
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,165
It's not about rules, Pol.

644
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,571
It's about he asked me.

645
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,690
It's about he told me

646
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,285
why he wanted to do it.

647
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,725
Now, if I tell you,

648
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,529
I can't take the knowledge back.

649
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,451
Better off without it.

650
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,805
So this is when
he was with the parish...

651
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,126
Better off without it, Pol.

652
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,245
This is when he was with the Fathers.

653
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,968
This is when he was in
the care of the Holy Fathers.

654
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,762
Michael wants it
so you don't know...

655
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,243
- That priest...
- That priest

656
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,730
who was there when he was taken in.

657
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,406
And who is still walking
the fucking Earth.

658
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,686
Fuck...

659
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,207
Fuck...

660
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,964
He asked me, Pol...

661
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,004
And I said yes.

662
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,051
And I said,

663
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,684
"You put a bullet
in that fucker's brains.

664
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,967
"By order of the Peaky Blinders."

665
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,287
No.

666
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,806
Not my son.

667
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,970
He'll still be as
dead if Arthur does it.

668
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,448
And part of him will always stay dead.

669
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,641
- I swear to God...
- In whose house it took place...

670
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,166
If my son pulls the trigger,

671
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,844
I will bring this whole fucking
organisation down around your ears.

672
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:08,500
