1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,049
<i>Get him out. Go! Go!</i>

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,627
<i>God! Hold on, sweetie!</i>

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm right here. Just hold on.

4
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,653
- Vitals?
- Heart rate 220. Temperature's 106.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,484
Will, where does it hurt?

6
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,070
All over.

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,872
She says he feels like he's burning.
Check for burns.

8
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,959
I don't see anything.

9
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,423
- Where does it hurt the most, Will?
- Everywhere! Everywhere!

10
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,146
Wait a sec. How big?

11
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,896
First it was like that.
Now he's like this.

12
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,569
I swear to God, man,
it's just some little lizard, okay?

13
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,442
- It's not a lizard.
- How do you know?

14
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,219
- How do I know if it's not?
- How do you know it's not just a lizard?

15
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,360
Because his face opened up
and he ate my cat.

16
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,145
I don't hear shit.

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,150
He's in there.

18
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,916
All right, listen, kid. I swear, if this
is some sort of Halloween prank,

19
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,118
- you're dead.
- It's not.

20
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,497
- All right?
- It's not a prank.

21
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,920
Get it out of my face.

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,834
You got a key for this thing?

23
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,390
Let me see that.

24
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,390
He must be further down there.

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,478
I'll stay up here
in case he tries to escape.

26
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,099
Steve?

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,398
Steve, what's going on down there?

28
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,864
Get down here.

29
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,742
Oh, shit.

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,875
Oh, shit!

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,963
No way.

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,007
No way.

33
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,212
That thing, it...
it did something to him.

34
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,710
Okay. And these now-memories,
as you call them,

35
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,462
how long has he been experiencing them?

36
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,919
I told you, since Thursday.
Since I found him in the field.

37
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,503
And why wasn't he brought in?

38
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,214
I have been bringing him in,
and what have you done?

39
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,015
Nothing. Nothing!

40
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,059
These are new symptoms, Joyce.

41
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,435
No. No, he has been telling you
over and over that something's wrong,

42
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,965
and you said it was all in his head.

43
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,814
You said, "Be patient."
Those were your words.

44
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,647
I understand that you're upset,
okay? I get it.

45
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,380
I would be, too, if I were in your shoes.

46
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,818
But we are all in the same boat here,
and I just need you to try...

47
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,495
What? Stay calm? Trust you?

48
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,125
No, I want him transferred
to a real hospital.

49
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,622
Well, you know that's not possible.

50
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,233
He really will get
the best treatment here, Mrs. Byers.

51
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,299
The very best.

52
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,422
And what are you
treating him for, exactly?

53
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,927
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with him?

54
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,437
Can a single person in this room
tell me what is wrong with my boy?

55
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,071
What is wrong with my boy?

56
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,446
<i>You see why I have
to stop the truth from spreading, too.</i>

57
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,948
<i>Just the same as those weeds there.</i>

58
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,870
<i>By whatever means necessary.</i>

59
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,640
Whoo-hoo!

60
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,477
- To taking down the man.
- To taking down the man.

61
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,694
Commie bastards sure know how
to make a spirit. Am I right?

62
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,536
- Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't.
- Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive.

63
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,864
Drive? What, tonight?

64
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,869
Our parents...

65
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,077
Would be proud
if they knew what you were up to.

66
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,005
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's
or Dawn's or whoever's,

67
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,128
and take my guest room.

68
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,846
- I mean, do... do you want to stay?
- Well, it is pretty late.

69
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,180
Okay. Uh...
Could I use the sofa?

70
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,515
Okay, I'm confused.
What's going on here? A lovers' quarrel?

71
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,521
- No, no. I mean, we're just friends.
- Friends.

72
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:18,576
You've told me a lot of shockers today,
but that, that is the first lie.

73
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,032
- It's not a lie.
- No?

74
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,664
You're young, attractive.

75
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:29,841
You've got chemistry, history,
plus the real shit, shared trauma.

76
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,922
Trust issues, am I right?

77
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,338
Something to do with your dad.

78
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,596
- What? No, I mean, my dad's...
- An asshole.

79
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,429
Hmm. It is a curse to see so clearly.

80
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,981
You, you're harder to read.

81
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,184
Probably, like everyone,

82
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,023
afraid of what would happen if you
accepted yourself for who you really are

83
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:58,077
and retreated back to the safety of...

84
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,655
- Name? Name?
- Steve.

85
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,459
Oh. Steve. We like Steve.

86
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,080
Yes.

87
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,914
- But we don't love Steve.
- What?

88
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:14,002
No, we... I mean, I do.

89
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:20,888
There it is, ladies and germs,
the second lie of the evening.

90
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,681
So, how'd I do?

91
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,942
My goodness.
You two are adorable, aren't you?

92
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,655
Listen...

93
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,484
...there's a pull-out sofa in my study
if you want it.

94
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,450
But if I were you,

95
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,656
I'd cut the bullshit
and share the damn bed.

96
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,302
Afraid.

97
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,349
Trust issues?

98
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,894
Trust issues.

99
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,899
Retreat?

100
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,566
I don't retreat.

101
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,021
Trust issues? I do not...

102
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,409
Oh. Hey.

103
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,999
Hey.

104
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,451
I just, uh...

105
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,753
I... I just wanted to say that...

106
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,082
Oh, no, don't... I mean... He's so drunk.

107
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,632
- Wasted.
- Yeah.

108
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,007
I mean, what? He knows us for a couple
of hours, and he's got us all figured out?

109
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,097
Exactly.

110
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,095
God. Okay, yeah. I feel...
I'm glad we feel the same way.

111
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,801
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

112
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,104
Uh...

113
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,687
So, uh, good night, I guess.

114
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,028
Yeah, um, good night.

115
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,802
Oh, He-Man, thank you for saving my life.
What strong muscles you have.

116
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,888
- I knew it.
- Hey! They're in love!

117
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,345
No, actually, they're not.
They don't even exist on the same planet.

118
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,056
Aren't you too old
to be playing with toys?

119
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,853
That... that's not the point.
The point is to stay out of my room.

120
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,690
Then tell your little nerdy friend
to shut his mouth.

121
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,067
What are you talking about?

122
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,825
"Code red, Lucas. Code red. Code red."

123
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,497
Bunch of nerds.

124
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,707
No, no, no, no, no, no.

125
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,622
Dustin!

126
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,884
<i>This is Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin?</i>

127
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,429
- Well, well, well, look who it is.
<i>- Sorry, man.</i>

128
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,972
My stupid sister turned it off.

129
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,721
Well, when you were having
sister problems, Dart grew again,

130
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,394
<i>he escaped, and I'm pretty sure
he's a baby Demogorgon.</i>

131
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,688
- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later.

132
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,016
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve?

133
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,942
And bring your binoculars
and wrist rocket.

134
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,235
<i>Steve Harrington?</i>

135
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,563
All right, let's go.

136
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,525
Just be there, stat. Over and out.

137
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,784
All right, cowboy, good news.

138
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,960
We're giving you the green light.

139
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,630
How you feeling?

140
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,086
Never better.

141
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,634
All right, well, got a present for ya.

142
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,765
- The hell is that?
- Uh, something you should see.

143
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,528
Watch your step.

144
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:19,686
All living organisms develop
defense mechanisms against attack.

145
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,486
They adapt. They find some way to survive.

146
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,873
Oh, my God.

147
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,868
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?

148
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,878
It's been spreading,

149
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,507
growing beneath us like some cancer.

150
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,303
- Why aren't you burning it?
- There's a complication.

151
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,103
They made me sign,
like, a thousand documents.

152
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,854
I mean...
we all had to. We had to.

153
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,731
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.

154
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,314
They're gonna make you
do the same. I'm sure.

155
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,775
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.

156
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,744
What kind of documents?

157
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,665
Uh, confidentiality,

158
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,209
and there were these official forms
saying, like, nothing ever happened,

159
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,295
which is why...

160
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,209
Will got lost in the woods.

161
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
Yeah.

162
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:33,138
Man, I always thought stuff like this
happened in movies and comic books.

163
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:37,013
Certainly not in Hawkins,
and certainly not to someone like you.

164
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,311
- Or you.
- Yeah.

165
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,273
Bob Newby, superhero.

166
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,105
You cold?

167
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,440
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.

168
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,905
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.

169
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,736
- Okay.
- Okay? I'm fine.

170
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,946
I'm fine.

171
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,831
It's not like you didn't warn me.
"This is not a normal family."

172
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,037
- Isn't that what you said?
- Yeah.

173
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,215
You weren't kidding.

174
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,803
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine
sound a little less crazy, right?

175
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,597
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.

176
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,686
Mom?

177
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,388
Hey.

178
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,561
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!

179
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,565
- Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay?
- Okay, they're on their way.

180
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,655
Hey.

181
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,991
- Who is that?
- What?

182
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,036
- What?
- It's me, big guy. It's Bob.

183
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,331
Are you a...

184
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,538
doctor?

185
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,964
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.

186
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,413
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

187
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,083
Uh, sorry?

188
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,760
The sofa.

189
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.

190
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,348
I bet.

191
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,221
Oops.

192
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,227
Mmm.

193
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,737
Oh, yeah.

194
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,775
Yeah, we just, um...

195
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,733
We just had some fun girl time.

196
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,721
- <i>Will you be back for dinner?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

197
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,974
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.
<i>- Say hey to Ally for me.</i>

198
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,490
Okay. All right.
I love you, too, Mom. Bye.

199
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,624
She said Mike's at your brother's house.
They just had a sleepover. So...

200
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,296
Oh, okay.

201
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,123
Do you wanna try again?

202
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,177
No. No, it's fine. They're probably
just at the matinée or something.

203
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,638
Yeah, I'm sure.

204
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,564
For your travels.

205
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,101
And to water it down.

206
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,363
Got it.

207
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,025
Thank you for everything.

208
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,237
Don't thank me yet.
Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm?

209
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,539
And if you need to reach me again...

210
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,166
don't.

211
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,055
Twenty-one.

212
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,109
Twenty-two.

213
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,233
- Max, are you getting that or what?
- Okay!

214
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,158
Swear to God, Max!

215
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,375
What are you doing here?

216
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,706
- I have proof.
- What?

217
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,588
Proof that what I told you was real.
But we have to hurry.

218
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,465
What kind of proof?

219
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,913
Who the hell were you talking to?

220
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,581
Mormons.

221
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,256
Mormons?

222
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,174
Talkative ones.

223
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,236
Come on, hop on.

224
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,021
Hurry.

225
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,741
This better be good, stalker.

226
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,416
Do you know your name?

227
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,747
Will.

228
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,629
- Your full name?
- William Byers.

229
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,922
Do you know... Do you know who I am?

230
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,138
A doctor.

231
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,183
Have we met before?

232
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,269
- I don't remember.
- Hmm.

233
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,147
<i>You don't remember me?</i>

234
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,143
<i>Okay.</i>

235
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,023
How about, uh... How about this guy here?

236
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,108
Know who that is?

237
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,205
It's all right. Take your time.

238
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,034
That's my friend.

239
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,546
Mike.

240
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,673
What about me, kid? You remember me?

241
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,427
They tell me you helped save me
last night. You remember that?

242
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,810
Do you remember anything about last night?
About what happened?

243
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,443
I remember they hurt me.

244
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,731
You mean the doctors?

245
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,986
No. The soldiers.

246
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,286
The soldiers hurt you?

247
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,032
They shouldn't have done that.

248
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,502
It upset him.

249
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,716
You say, "Upset him." Is that him?

250
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,760
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.

251
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,971
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,

252
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,852
but I think it's really gonna help us
understand what's going on.

253
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:40,978
Is that okay?

254
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,230
Okay.

255
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,071
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know
if you feel anything. Okay?

256
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,463
- Do you feel anything?
- Little sting.

257
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,094
It stings? Where?

258
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,344
My chest.

259
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,552
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie...

260
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,099
- How about now?
- It... it burns.

261
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,603
Ah!

262
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,060
- It burns.
- Where?

263
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,445
Everywhere.

264
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,065
That's enough. That's enough!

265
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,072
Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

266
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,494
That's it! We're done!

267
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,321
Okay.

268
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,123
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

269
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:45,835
Our best guess right now
is it's some kind of virus

270
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:50,215
which is causing
this neurological disorder.

271
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:54,423
Now, when... when a typical virus
attaches itself to its host...

272
00:23:55,935 --> 00:24:01,476
...it duplicates, right? It spreads,
essentially hijacking the host.

273
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,057
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.

274
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,193
That's not... That's not unusual.

275
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,613
What is so unusual here,

276
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,366
this virus... the infected hosts
seem to be communicating.

277
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:24,955
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,
and it's connecting all the hosts.

278
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,623
The good news is a virus can be cured.

279
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,464
<i>We... we're gonna continue to run tests.</i>

280
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,636
<i>We're gonna see what we find.</i>

281
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:39,051
What happens
when he can't remember anything?

282
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,431
When there's
nothing else there?

283
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,148
What happens when my boy is gone?

284
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,826
All right,
so let me get this straight.

285
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,245
You kept something
you knew was probably dangerous

286
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:04,247
in order to impress a girl who...
who you just met?

287
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,746
All right,
that's grossly oversimplifying things.

288
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,423
I mean, why would a girl
like some nasty slug anyway?

289
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,047
An interdimensional slug?
Because it's awesome.

290
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,937
Well, even if she thought it was cool,
which she didn't, I... I just...

291
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,637
I don't know. I just feel like
you're trying way too hard.

292
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,967
Well, not everyone can have
your perfect hair, all right?

293
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,683
It's not about the hair, man.

294
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,810
The key with girls is just...
just acting like you don't care.

295
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,519
- Even if you do?
- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

296
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,195
- Then what?
- You just wait until, uh...

297
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,326
- until you feel it.
- Feel what?

298
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,908
It's like before it's gonna storm,
you know?

299
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,706
You can't see it,
but you can feel it, like this, uh...

300
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,581
electricity, you know?

301
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,630
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

302
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,209
No, no, no, no, no.
Like a... Like a sexual electricity.

303
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,303
Oh.

304
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,757
You feel that and then you make your move.

305
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,304
So that's when you kiss her?

306
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,056
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.

307
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:08,231
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah,
they want you to be aggressive.

308
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,025
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...

309
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,728
- I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.

310
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,566
But others, you gotta be slow,
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

311
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,243
like a ninja.

312
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,785
What type is Nancy?

313
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,823
Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.

314
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,496
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

315
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,202
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

316
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:34,041
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.

317
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,421
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

318
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,512
You're not falling in love with this girl,
are you?

319
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,968
Uh, no. No.

320
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,892
- Okay, good. Don't.
- I won't.

321
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,399
She's only gonna break your heart,
and you're way too young for that shit.

322
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,439
Fabergé.

323
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,533
What?

324
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,444
It's Fabergé Organics.

325
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,579
Use the shampoo and conditioner,
and when your hair's damp...

326
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,782
It's not wet, okay?

327
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,457
- When it's damp...
- Damp.

328
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,791
You do four puffs
of the Farrah Fawcett spray.

329
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,791
- Farrah Fawcett spray?
- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

330
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,969
You tell anyone I just told you that
and your ass is grass.

331
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,012
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?

332
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,099
Yup.

333
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
Okay.

334
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,814
- Farrah Fawcett, really?
- I mean, she's hot.

335
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,520
Yeah.

336
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,786
Hey, it's, uh...

337
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
It's me.

338
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,544
I know that I've been
gone too long, and, uh...

339
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,758
It's... I just, I want you to know
that it's not about you

340
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,717
and it's not about our fight.

341
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,021
<i>Okay?</i>

342
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,230
<i>Something came up, and I will...
I will explain it all when I see you.</i>

343
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,778
<i>I just... I want you to know
that I'm not mad.</i>

344
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,281
I'm just sorry.

345
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,412
About everything.

346
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,791
I...

347
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,750
<i>I don't want you to get hurt at all.</i>

348
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,334
<i>And I don't wanna lose you.</i>

349
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,141
Just make sure you heat up
some real food. Not just Eggos.

350
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,191
And I want you to eat all the peas,
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

351
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,816
I will be home soon.

352
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,526
<i>This is him last week.</i>

353
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,539
And there are the hippocampal
abnormalities we had discussed.

354
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,332
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

355
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,456
from others suffering
from post-traumatic stress. But...

356
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,922
this is Will from last night.

357
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,124
And as you can see,

358
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,928
there are now abnormalities
in the limbic and paralimbic areas.

359
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,013
And this...

360
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,969
is from an hour ago.

361
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:41,145
- I don't hear any suggestions.
- We have bigger problems than the boy.

362
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,571
- Do we?
- We can't keep delaying the burn.

363
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,113
You're talking about putting...
putting a Band-Aid on this.

364
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,321
- Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
- It's our only option.

365
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,127
- And if it kills the boy?
- Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

366
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,455
Say that to me again.

367
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:05,002
The rate this is spreading,
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

368
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,213
What we do or don't do
won't change the outcome.

369
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,889
We have to start the burn.

370
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,435
Where you going?

371
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,179
I'm going to think.

372
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,613
What the hell is taking so long?

373
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:33,573
Hey... doctors take forever, always.
Just try and relax. Just be patient.

374
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,548
You know, I just...

375
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,721
Let me through. Let me through!

376
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,748
- You know we can't do that.
- I need to talk to...

377
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,731
- He'll be with you shortly.
- You said that an hour ago.

378
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,246
<i>Will.</i>

379
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,699
Will? Will?

380
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,870
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

381
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,251
Uh...

382
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,628
I saw something.

383
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,086
In your now-memories?

384
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,307
The shadow monster.

385
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,345
I think I know how to stop him.

386
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,830
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

387
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,869
This will do just fine.

388
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,580
Good call, dude.

389
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,799
I said medium-well!

390
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,016
Who's that?

391
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:25,854
You told her?

392
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,685
- So what?
- "So what?"

393
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,966
- You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right?

394
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,733
We agreed not to tell her
and to look for Dart.

395
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,910
- Who you conveniently found.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

396
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,534
I'm saying you have
a creepy little bond with him.

397
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,910
Yeah, that was before
he turned into a Demogorgon.

398
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,867
- And you haven't heard from Mike?
- No.

399
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,168
- Or Will?
- No.

400
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,871
- Hopper?
- No! No one is around.

401
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,173
Why do you think
I'm with Steve Harrington?

402
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,005
- Something's...
- Wrong. I agree.

403
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,712
Which is why we need
as much help as we can get.

404
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,473
She didn't believe me anyway.

405
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,312
You probably didn't tell it right.

406
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,515
That must be it.

407
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,609
So, we good?

408
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,983
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one
helping me out is this random girl?

409
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,989
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.
Let's go, I said!

410
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,492
- All right, asshole! God!
- Okay! Stupid.

411
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,975
What...

412
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,595
What is all of this?

413
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,894
I don't know.

414
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,985
Mom?

415
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,363
Will?

416
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,140
I don't shoot Polaroid.

417
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,764
- What?
- It's not mine.

418
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,307
Someone else has been here.

419
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,451
Sam, this is ludicrous.

420
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,784
- Just give him a moment, okay?
- We don't have time...

421
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,166
Hey, jackass, why don't you
do us all a favor and shut up, okay?

422
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,682
That's it.

423
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,810
That's what? What... what's there, Will?

424
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,064
I don't know.

425
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,061
I just know
he doesn't want me to see there.

426
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,233
I think it's important.

427
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,139
Let's see if this kid's a wizard
or schizo, Doc.

428
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,597
First door on your right, gentlemen.

429
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,645
- I'm guessing a ten.
- Let's not overdo it now.

430
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,772
I read four.

431
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,858
Moving in.

432
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:45,882
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

433
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,100
So you really fought
one of these things before?

434
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,480
And you're, like, totally,
100% sure it wasn't a bear?

435
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,650
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?
It wasn't a bear.

436
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,944
Why are you even here
if you don't believe us?

437
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,237
Just go home.

438
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,325
Geesh. Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime?

439
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,205
That's good. Just show her you don't care.

440
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,254
I don't.

441
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,507
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

442
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,095
- It's kinda awesome.
- Huh?

443
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,725
The fog, I mean.

444
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,812
Looks like the ocean.

445
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,235
- You miss it?
- What?

446
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,735
The ocean. The waves? California?

447
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,784
- Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
- No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

448
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,079
My dad's still there. So...

449
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,166
- Why?
- It's this legal term called "divorce."

450
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,752
See, when two married people
don't love each other anymore...

451
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,846
Yeah.

452
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,261
My mom and my stepdad,

453
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,892
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

454
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:24,690
As if... As if he was the problem,
which is total bull.

455
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,395
And things...

456
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,239
are just worse now.

457
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,859
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

458
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:37,574
but now he's just angry...
all the time and...

459
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,333
Well, he can't take it out
on my mom, so...

460
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,044
So he takes it out on you?

461
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,174
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

462
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:58,432
It's just... I know that I can be
a jerk like him sometimes,

463
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,979
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

464
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:09,193
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

465
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,248
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

467
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,327
Hey. You're nothing
like your brother, okay?

468
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,790
You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.

469
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,051
And you're, like, totally tubular.

470
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,596
- Nobody actually says that, you know.
- Well, I do now.

471
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,765
And it makes you seem really cool.

472
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,851
I like talking with you, Mad Max.

473
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,521
And I like talking with you, stalker.

474
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,358
- You see him?
- No.

475
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,119
Lucas, what's going on?

476
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,242
Hold on!

477
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,373
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock!

478
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,051
There.

479
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,756
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

480
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,808
- Wait. You sure that's not a dog?
- What?

481
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,063
He's not taking the bait.
Why is he not taking the bait?

482
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,225
Maybe he's not hungry?

483
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,144
Maybe he's sick of cow.

484
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,572
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?

485
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,208
Steve?

486
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,376
Just get ready.

487
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,776
Come on, buddy.

488
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,997
- What's he doing?
- Expanding the menu.

489
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,870
Come on, buddy.

490
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,495
Come on, buddy.

491
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,756
Come on. Dinner time.

492
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,339
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.

493
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,589
He's insane.

494
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,549
He's awesome.

495
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,822
Steve, watch out!

496
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,077
A little busy here!

497
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,376
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

498
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,127
Steve!

499
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,545
Steve! Abort! Abort!

500
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,142
- Steve, run!
- Steve, hurry!

501
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,473
Steve, run!

502
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:34,939
Shit!

503
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,691
Are they rabid or something?

504
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,364
They can't get in! They can't!

505
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,454
Shit!

506
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:50,785
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone!

507
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,039
Shit!

508
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,253
We're at the old junkyard,
and we are going to die!

509
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,560
Out of the way! Out of the way!
You want some? Come get this!

510
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,882
Jeez.

511
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,189
What happened?

512
00:44:58,988 --> 00:44:59,899
I don't know.

513
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,901
- Steve scared 'em off?
- No.

514
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,491
No way.

515
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,360
They're going somewhere.

516
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,710
- <i>Almost there, ladies.</i>
- Roger.

517
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,357
All right, stay frosty, boys.

518
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,699
- Wait. That's where I was.
- What?

519
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,830
It's that damn graveyard.

520
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,969
Sir, there's nothing here.

521
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,787
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.

522
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,409
Got some kind of fog
moving in now.

523
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,665
I'm sorry.

524
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,210
What? What do you mean, sweetie?

525
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,714
He made me do it.

526
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,877
Who? Who made you do what?

527
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,879
I told you.

528
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,180
They upset him.

529
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,259
They shouldn't have done that.

530
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,270
They shouldn't have upset him.

531
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,233
The spy.

532
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,942
The spy!

533
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,029
We've got movement.

534
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,358
You've got company, fellas.

535
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,157
Whoa, whoa!

536
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,075
I need to get through! It's a trap!

537
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,575
It's a trap! I need to warn them.
It's a trap!

538
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,910
I can't see shit!
Where are they? Where are they?

539
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,204
They're right on you!

540
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,338
- Wait, what?
- What was that?

541
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,433
Will, sweets, talk to me.
You got to help me understand.

542
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,972
It's too late.

543
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,998
You should go now.

544
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,052
They're almost here.

545
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:27,076
