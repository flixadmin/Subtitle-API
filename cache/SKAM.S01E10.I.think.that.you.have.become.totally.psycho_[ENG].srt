1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,860
I'm just sorting my salad.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
I'm not on the bus anymore.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,140
Anyway, I'm back with the Pepsi Max girls.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,340
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,940
You just made out a bit?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,540
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
It was your boyfriend who tipped me off.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,900
- But my boyfriend didn't know.
- The little blonde guy. Isakyaki? Isak?

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,560
Isn't that what he's called?

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,790
SHAME

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,260
Hello! This is Isak.
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,080
SATURDAY, 11:04 A.M.

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,910
But you can leave a message after the beep.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,300
BEEP! Kidding, here comes the beep.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,180
Isak, pick up your damn phone now,
because I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,440
HERE LIVES

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,440
Terje and Marianne Valtersen

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,440
Isak and Lea

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,920
Hi.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,390
Hi.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,290
Where's Isak?

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,300
Isak is a bit upset.

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,820
What's happened?

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,250
Well, his father left,
and his mother had a breakdown.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh. Shit!

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,490
Yeah, it's pretty shit.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,010
But...

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,970
is he doing okay?

29
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,830
I don't know really.
His mother was already pretty crazy.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,510
Yeah.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,320
Were you picking something up, or?

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,660
No... I just wanted to
talk to him about something.

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,380
- But he's not answering his phone.
- Yeah, I think he turned it off.

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,590
How are you doing?

35
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,040
Good!

36
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,940
Or...

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,520
you know.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
Yeah, I know.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,780
But...

40
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,140
Say hi to him.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,330
Yeah, but don't you want to come in?

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm sure he wants to see you.

43
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,900
No... I think...

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
He has you, so...

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah.

46
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,370
Bye.

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,150
Bye.

48
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,680
MONDAY, 12:05 P.M.

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,100
Okay, what's the symbolism of porridge?

50
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,550
I'm really struggling here.

51
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,940
"In the barn sits Santa
with his Christmas porridge."

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,840
What is the porridge? Porridge is porridge.

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,100
- Why did you choose that song?
- Because I thought it was going to be easy.

54
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,240
- You have to hand it in next class.
- I know. And I forgot. That's the way it is.

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,900
The porridge symbolises...

56
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,000
- Life?
- Life?

57
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,980
Fits perfectly. Life.

58
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,060
- Did you do it? Which did you pick?
- Mhm. "Deilig er jorden".

59
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,150
- Isn't that a really Christian song?
- It has a beautiful message.

60
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,650
Fuck! Message! I need to write about that.
What's the message in "På låven sitter nissen"?

61
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,390
Vilde?

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,040
Hi!

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,860
Hi.

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,860
- How's it going with you?
- Really good! And with you?

65
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
Good.

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,510
Come sit with us.

67
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,000
I would really love to, but me, Sara, Ingrid,
and the Pepsi Max girls are going to the café.

68
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,180
So... maybe next time?

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,180
- How's it going with your bus?
- Good.

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,730
- Did you find a sponsor yet?
- Not yet.

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,650
You just gotta work on it.

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,920
Then they'll come running to you soon.

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,730
Hi! Are you guys here? Are we...
do you want to eat here?

74
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,140
Because then I'll just go and get my jacket,
and I'll be right back.

75
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,640
What...

76
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,580
what happened just now?

77
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,790
TUESDAY, 10:11 A.M.

78
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,330
Hi.

79
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,450
Hi.

80
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,180
- Watch out when you go up the stairs.
- Me?! It's you who has to watch out.

81
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay...

82
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,060
- How's it going with Isak?
- Yeah, it's going better now.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,300
But he's not at school?

84
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,090
No, he's chilling at home for a bit.
Taking a break.

85
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,210
But you should call him, or text him
or something. He would like that.

86
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Yeah, I'll do that. I just forgot.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,040
- What do you have now?
- I have French.

88
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,100
And you?

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,700
Awkward...

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,300
Jonas!

91
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,300
What the hell are you doing?!

92
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,540
Jonas!

93
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,640
- What the fuck, you have to back me up!
- You hooked up with his girl.

94
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,210
- If I were him, I would've killed you.
- Calm down.

95
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,350
WEDNESDAY, 12:09 P.M.

96
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Hi!

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,140
Hi.

98
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,290
How's it going?

99
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Good. Or...

100
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,220
it's going fine.

101
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,460
- How's it going with you?
- It's going good.

102
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,830
I've.. I've dumped Chris.

103
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
- Did you?
- Mhm.

104
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,020
- That's good, Iben!
- Yeah.

105
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,440
Also, I'm having a girl power Christmas party
on Friday.

106
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,130
You have to come.

107
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,850
- Girl power Christmas party?
- Yeah, and no third-year guys are invited.

108
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,020
Okay.

109
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,810
They have too much power at this school.
All the drama is because of them.

110
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,260
Us girls have to start sticking up
for each other.

111
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,960
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

112
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,260
So, an all girls party?

113
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,080
No, no. We need guys there. So I thought
we could maybe invite some first-year guys.

114
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,460
- Okay?
- They're the most...

115
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,450
undervalued group at school.

116
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,300
- See you on Friday then, bring your friends.
- Yeah, cool!

117
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,180
If you know any hot first-year guys,
just invite them.

118
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,070
- Yeah, I'll find some.
- Okay, good.

119
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,810
But, I was just wondering...

120
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,340
- Could you maybe ask Vilde if she wants to come?
- Vilde?

121
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,510
Yeah, Vilde Lien. She's a first-year.

122
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,040
Of course, you can just bring her.

123
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,640
But...

124
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,270
I think she'd be very happy
if you invited her.

125
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah, okay! I'll find her on Facebook.

126
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,220
Thanks!

127
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,300
FRIDAY, 7:52 P.M.

128
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,600
I need water!

129
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,880
Have you heard anything from Vilde?

130
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,240
No.

131
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,790
- Eva, Have you heard anything from Vilde?
- No.

132
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,590
- Iben, did you invite Vilde?
- Yeah, she said she would come.

133
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,980
Check out this Snapchat filter.

134
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,020
Yay, even more first-year guys!

135
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,140
- Isak?
- Hi! Eva!

136
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,090
- How's it going with you?
- It's going...

137
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,240
- better.
- Good.

138
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
How's it going with your mom now?

139
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,780
Good. Who the hell knows, but...

140
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,770
it's a lot of stress.

141
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,290
- I'm sure she and dad will work it out.
- That's good.

142
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,500
So, you're doing better, then?

143
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm doing better now.

144
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,240
- I have some news for you.
- Yeah?

145
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,060
Me and Jonas are back together.

146
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,180
Seriously?

147
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,070
He hasn't said anything yet, but...

148
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,190
that's great!

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
Yeah, I know.

150
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,980
He hasn't...

151
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,260
he has forgiven you and everything?

152
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,950
Yes!

153
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,580
That's great!

154
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,890
So... I just wanted to say...
thank you so much for being there for me.

155
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,620
I don't know what I would've done this autumn,
if it hadn't been for you.

156
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,610
I don't have a lot of...

157
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,000
people in my life
that I feel I can trust. But...

158
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,590
you're one of them. So, thanks.

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,950
I'm just...
glad that you guys worked it out.

160
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,830
Yeah. I'm glad you're
cheering for me and Jonas.

161
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,380
Team Jonas!

162
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,610
There's just...

163
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,060
one thing I was wondering.

164
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,620
Mhm?

165
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,350
When you outed me on @nissenhook
that me and Chris had hooked up,

166
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,410
where you cheering for us then?

167
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,700
Because... our relationship
went to hell after that!

168
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,240
Or, my whole life went to hell after that!
So you have to tell me what you were thinking.

169
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,810
Because I think it's completely psycho!
Why did you do it?!

170
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
What were you thinking?

171
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,600
You really don't know why?

172
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,240
No, I really don't know why!

173
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,470
Think about it.

174
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,940
What? Do you have...

175
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Do you have like...

176
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,620
feelings for me?

177
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,630
As if you didn't know?

178
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,910
- No... I... I didn't know.
- Well...

179
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,110
So it's not that damn fun for me
when I have to sit and listen to you...

180
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,890
talking about Jonas, and me having to be
your fucking counselor.

181
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,110
It's not that damn fun for me.

182
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm sitting there like a damn idiot,

183
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,730
hoping that one day you'll understand...

184
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,080
that he's not good enough for you.

185
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,140
Isak, I... I didn't know.

186
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,090
Honestly, Eva.

187
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,640
How could you not understand?

188
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,790
But anyway, that's not an excuse
for what you did.

189
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,090
- You outed me to the whole school!
- It was stupid. I fucked up.

190
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
I was drunk and...

191
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,290
I... was also... pretty mad... at you.

192
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,270
Because I was thinking you were using me.

193
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,550
I also didn't know Chris had
such a psycho girlfriend,

194
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,440
who would make a lot of drama.

195
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,980
- Then of course I wouldn't have done it.
- Eva, come.

196
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,370
Now!

197
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,900
Eva.

198
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,220
Don't...

199
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,330
you can't tell Jonas anything about this, okay?

200
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,020
- Call an ambulance!
- Let's call an ambulance.

201
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,400
- Vilde!
- What happened?!

202
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,320
She came in, started staggering,
and then she tripped. She's not responding.

203
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,610
- Is your mom home?
- No, no!

204
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,900
I think I killed William's baby tonight.
