1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,791
I've seen you grow up.

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,125
Become a man.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,458
The whole cycle of your life.

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,208
Time chose you.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,750
God chose you.

6
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,833
Don't forget
that we are your home now, too.

7
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,833
No harm will come to you.

8
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,333
We're watching over you.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,541
Time is always with you.

10
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,666
Wherever you go.

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,166
You carry it in you.

12
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,458
And it carries you.

13
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,208
It sees and hears everything

14
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,000
that you do and say.

15
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,625
Claudia! Haven't you left yet?

16
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,166
I... I forgot the milk money.

17
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,333
-But it's okay.
-Wait.

18
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,375
Get yourself some fruit drops.

19
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,958
Thanks.

20
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,458
Do you think she noticed?

21
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,208
Don't worry.
Every family has its secrets.

22
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,541
Are you going somewhere?

23
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,916
Nowhere special.

24
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,750
Just some errands.

25
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,583
You're beautiful.

26
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,666
JUNE 23, 1954

27
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,125
FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,208
Helge.

29
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,375
And if we know that He listens
to what we ask for,

30
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,250
we can be sure
that we have what we've asked of Him.

31
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,875
Nothing is lost from His sight.
He returns all things.

32
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,333
POLICE

33
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:15,583
Seven months on and we still have no idea
who this monster is.

34
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:21,333
Why is he refusing to reveal his identity?

35
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,291
Why is no one looking for him?

36
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,333
It makes you wonder
how some people live.

37
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,333
Almost like ghosts.

38
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,541
Egon...

39
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,916
Can I ask you something?

40
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,125
Your wife and you,

41
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,708
are things still...

42
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,416
Do you still have...

43
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,916
A lot?

44
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,958
No. At all.

45
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,208
Look at that.

46
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,625
I didn't think
they still made people like you.

47
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,416
Boy, Egon...

48
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,708
You've got to let off some steam.

49
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,583
Marriage isn't...

50
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,666
the way it's sold to us.

51
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,458
As soon as they have children

52
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,375
they become different people.

53
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,625
It's like they're married to the brats.

54
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,208
It's how nature wanted it.

55
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,166
But out there...

56
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,166
there are still loads
of tender buds to pluck.

57
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,125
They found him!

58
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,750
Found who?

59
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,708
The Doppler boy.

60
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,250
Helge Doppler?

61
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,166
-His body?
-No.

62
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,666
The boy is alive.

63
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,500
He just walked in the door
as if nothing had happened.

64
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,625
Do you like your mother?

65
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,541
Mine is peculiar sometimes.
She always acts like I don't get anything.

66
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,916
When I have kids I'll be different.

67
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,291
How come you never talk about
how it was where you're from?

68
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,250
Before you came to Winden?

69
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,500
My mother was often sad.

70
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,916
I was in an orphanage for ages.

71
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,500
She doesn't like to talk about it,
so I don't, either.

72
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,041
Don't you have any family
besides your mother?

73
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,875
My mother has a brother.

74
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,041
But I think they hate each other.

75
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,958
Do you think she's happy here?

76
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,875
Will you show it to me now?

77
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,541
Where are those damn ghosts?

78
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,625
-Have you seen my book?
-What book?

79
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,083
The Ghosts!

80
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,625
You don't have to gawp at me like that.
I know I'm late.

81
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,125
-Did you put that there?
-No, I...

82
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,208
I thought maybe...

83
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,458
Maybe you'd like to skip school
and we'll do something nice.

84
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,333
I don't know. I just thought we haven't
done anything together in so long.

85
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,625
I have a German exam today,
and I wanted to go to the lake later.

86
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,041
Maybe another time.

87
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,875
Regina, wait.

88
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,291
I like how you wear your hair now.

89
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,208
It makes you look so... grown up.

90
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,666
Thanks.

91
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,916
I don't have any time. I have to go.

92
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,291
Time...

93
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

94
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,333
FOR CLAUDIA FROM HELGE

95
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,583
Hello, Mrs. Doppler.

96
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've already told
your colleagues everything.

97
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,750
I'd like to ask Helge a few questions.

98
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,208
He still hasn't said a single word.

99
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,166
Something is odd about the boy.

100
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,250
It won't take long.

101
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,791
Helge.

102
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,916
Remember me?

103
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,666
I'm Claudia's father.

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,166
Won't you tell me
where you were all this time?

105
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,875
And with whom?

106
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,958
Who did that to you?

107
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,083
The inspector asked you something.

108
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,500
Say something, for goodness sake!

109
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,250
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

110
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,333
It may sound peculiar, but I...

111
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
The book from last year.

112
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,416
-Why did you give it to me?
-I...

113
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,416
thought...

114
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,166
you may be the only one
who understands me.

115
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:17,958
Time is always with you
wherever you go.

116
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,208
You carry it in you.

117
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,541
And it carries you.

118
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,625
It sees and hears everything you do

119
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,000
and say.

120
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,708
What's that supposed to mean?

121
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,041
He said...

122
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,958
it's a battle between good and evil,
between light and dark.

123
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,458
That the travelers can undo
everything that happens.

124
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,625
If we succeed, none of it will happen.

125
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,875
Who said that?

126
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,333
Noah.

127
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,166
Who is Noah?

128
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,291
You mustn't trust him. Never! Do you hear?

129
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,166
Never!

130
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,458
Helge!

131
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,916
I'm sorry.

132
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,833
I didn't want all this.

133
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,625
Did anybody see you?

134
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,416
They sent Helge back today.

135
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,166
Noah is back, too.

136
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,125
I'm not scared of him anymore.

137
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,958
You carry the same blood.

138
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
You can't choose your family.

139
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
Renouncing your blood
means freeing yourself.

140
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
You said so yourself.

141
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,083
Still, our family shapes us
our entire lives.

142
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,916
Sic Mundus...

143
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,708
They're preparing the next cycle.

144
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,125
In four days.

145
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,833
Your brother is a blind fool.

146
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,458
All the suffering he causes people.

147
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,291
But it will have an end.

148
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,458
You must give me this.

149
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,083
Not now. There is still time.

150
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,708
Today?

151
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,166
I wanted to thank you.

152
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,166
For everything.

153
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,541
My mother loves you, do you know that?

154
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,916
She will make you very happy
if you let her.

155
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,916
Are you HG Tannhaus?

156
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,583
Heterochromia.

157
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
One blue eye,

158
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,833
one brown.

159
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Did you write this book?

160
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,333
I wondered when the day would come.

161
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,083
When we'd meet again.

162
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,750
I don't even know you.

163
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,708
But I know you.

164
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
A never-ending cycle.

165
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,041
Peculiar.

166
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,833
And he didn't talk?

167
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,833
What do you make of it?

168
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,875
He just turns up out of nowhere.

169
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,666
Maybe they are unrelated after all.

170
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,625
The madman who killed the children
and the Doppler boy.

171
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,583
How could he have done it?

172
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,083
He's been doing time for six months.

173
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,916
Maybe he wasn't alone.

174
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,916
You mean he has an accomplice?

175
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,916
Visit the madman again.

176
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,375
Maybe he'll talk now.

177
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,375
An accomplice. Yes.

178
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,958
CLOSED PSYCHIATRIC WARD 3

179
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,750
I want to know what it all means.

180
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,041
These lyrics.

181
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,666
You said those words to me in 1953.

182
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:50,250
But this was only released last year.

183
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,166
You said...

184
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,875
you had a son yourself.

185
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,333
Why did you murder the children?

186
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,708
I didn't murder the children.

187
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,375
I wanted to save them.

188
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
You said I was going to die.

189
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,833
How did you know I have cancer?

190
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,625
The White Devil?

191
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,541
Do you know who that is?

192
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,208
You're more deranged than I am.

193
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,083
Why did you never tell us
what your name is?

194
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,291
Who you are?

195
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,500
Ulrich.

196
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
Ulrich Nielsen.

197
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,291
And I come from the future.

198
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,083
I am what one calls a fraud.

199
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,958
Have you ever heard 
of the bootstrap paradox?

200
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,375
No.

201
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,500
In a bootstrap paradox,

202
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,125
an object

203
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,333
or information

204
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,625
from the future is sent back to the past.

205
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:52,500
That creates a never-ending cycle

206
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:57,083
in which the object
no longer has any real origin.

207
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,833
It exists

208
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,833
without ever having been created.

209
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,250
Put simply,

210
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,583
this book has traveled back in time.

211
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,000
It found me

212
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,916
before I even wrote it.

213
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,833
It's all a question of origin.

214
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,291
Where is the beginning?
When is the beginning?

215
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,958
Is there a beginning at all?

216
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,625
The world is full of such paradoxes.

217
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,916
Only most of the time,
we choose to look away.

218
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,916
Good luck, but he doesn't talk.

219
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,458
To anyone.

220
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,541
I don't think
you'll get anything out of him.

221
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Hello.

222
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,750
My name is Tiedemann.

223
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,916
Egon Tiedemann. Do you remember me?

224
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,250
I arrested you last year.

225
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,041
There are a few things
I'd like to ask you.

226
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,125
The Doppler boy is back home.

227
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,291
I want to know where Helge was.

228
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,250
Do you have an accomplice?

229
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,291
If you talk to me it...

230
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,291
might influence your situation here.

231
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,833
It's his medication.

232
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,291
We have to sedate him.

233
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,000
Has he said what his name is yet?

234
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,583
Not to my knowledge.

235
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,125
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.

236
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,541
MADS NIELSEN (12) MISSING

237
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,125
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

238
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,000
WINDEN BOY VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE

239
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,041
REFERENCE FILE

240
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,000
INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

241
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,750
Name unknown.

242
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,083
Age nine to 11.

243
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,666
Claims his father's name
is Ulrich Nielsen.

244
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,541
Don't you want to tell me at last

245
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,583
why you're really here?

246
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,958
You want to know how it works.

247
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,583
How did you know that?

248
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:05,541
She told me
that you would turn up here one day

249
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,125
and that I should explain the device 
to you.

250
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,875
That is,

251
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,666
you, yourself.

252
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,208
Your future self.

253
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:21,416
The paradox is that a short time ago
I wouldn't have been to explain it to you.

254
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,041
But last year

255
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,500
someone else explained it to me.

256
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,000
Another...

257
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,583
time traveler.

258
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,250
I think she knew it.

259
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,208
She knew everything that would happen,

260
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:40,000
right up to the present moment.

261
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,291
She knew that you would show up here

262
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,833
for me to tell you,

263
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:46,500
and therefore her,

264
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,750
how the device works.

265
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,958
I find him creepy.

266
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,625
As if he were empty inside now,
merely a husk.

267
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,750
He was never the brightest child,
but you could now believe he's mindless.

268
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,750
He scares me.

269
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,500
And without Bernd at home, I don't know 
how to deal with the situation.

270
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,166
Perhaps the devil himself
has possessed him.

271
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,583
Please look at him and tell me
everything is all right with him.

272
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,375
And he hasn't said a word?

273
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,500
Helge, come downstairs.
Someone wants to talk to you.

274
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,208
Time is always with you.

275
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,958
Wherever you go.

276
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,958
You carry it in you.

277
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,708
And it carries you.

278
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,750
It sees and hears everything
that you do and say.

279
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,666
Your mother is worried about you.

280
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,958
Shall we show her she has no reason to be?

281
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,500
I'd like you to read this for me.

282
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,541
Will you do that?

283
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,250
"You are my protection,

284
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,625
my shield.

285
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,416
I hope for your word."

286
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,041
He speaks!

287
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,416
Give him a little time.

288
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,250
I'm sure he's just choosing his words
with great care.

289
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,583
You can keep it.

290
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,458
Won't you stay a while?

291
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,833
He has returned.

292
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,541
To your bosom.

293
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,916
He is a miracle.

294
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,916
Don't forget that.

295
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,708
So just what are you doing here?

296
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,416
I'm merely trying

297
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,583
to fill in some gaps in a few old files.

298
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,666
Just to order things.

299
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,375
I'd like to talk to the boy.

300
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,416
Michael's asleep.

301
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,875
During the day?

302
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,333
He wasn't feeling well.

303
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,791
Has he ever said anything to you
about his parents?

304
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,458
Michael wants to put that all behind him.

305
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,916
He has a new life now.

306
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,041
Has he ever mentioned their names to you?

307
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,791
First names? Nicknames?

308
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,583
The name Ulrich?

309
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,125
He hasn't mentioned that to you, either?

310
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,250
Has he ever...

311
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,541
talked about a "White Devil"?

312
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:05,958
No.

313
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:09,833
I don't understand
what the point of all these questions is.

314
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,583
Perhaps I can talk to him tomorrow?

315
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,291
-Yes.
-Fine.

316
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,125
If anything else comes to mind,

317
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,291
just give me a call.

318
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,875
All right.

319
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,541
SLEEPING PILLS

320
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,000
I, um...

321
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,041
I've been sleeping badly again.

322
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,916
Nightmares.

323
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,458
One more thing.

324
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,125
Do you maybe have a photo of the boy?

325
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,375
Just for the files.

326
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,875
Just for the files, right?

327
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,041
Just for the files.

328
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,416
What do you want here?

329
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,875
Did Claudia send you?

330
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,958
If you think Adam will let you back in,
you're wrong.

331
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,833
You picked your side.

332
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,166
There's no salvation for you.

333
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,666
I know where the final pages are.

334
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:27,500
I also know
how long Adam's been looking for them.

335
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,750
Don't you think he'd do anything 
to get them?

336
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,125
I don't believe a word you say.

337
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,875
She would never have told you
where they are.

338
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,375
Claudia has them on her.

339
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,250
In return, I want you to tell Adam
I want to come back.

340
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,666
Before the new cycle begins.

341
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,708
You're sacrificing her?

342
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:12,541
You can't hate your own sister
the way you hate her.

343
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,833
Consider it a peace offering.

344
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,208
Yes?

345
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,041
There's someone here to see you.

346
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,166
All right.

347
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,791
You can go in.

348
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,083
Can I help you?

349
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,083
One brown eye, one blue eye.

350
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,333
That's rare.

351
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,041
Like my daughter.

352
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,583
You're too good a person.

353
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,583
But you always have been.

354
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,250
The world doesn't deserve you.

355
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
Excuse me, but...

356
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,166
do we know each other?

357
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:18,166
I'm here
because I have to tell you something.

358
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,208
I'm sorry.

359
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,750
What are you sorry about?

360
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,958
Everything.

361
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,166
You don't deserve any of this.

362
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,583
But sometimes
the good ones get hit hardest.

363
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,750
I don't understand.

364
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,416
You will one day.

365
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,291
And then I want you to know

366
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:02,666
that I'm sorry that things turned out
the way they turned out.

367
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,291
Either you tell me this instant
what this is all about

368
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,458
or I'll ask you to leave immediately.

369
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,708
I am sorry, I really am.

370
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,375
Ms. Tiedemann,
I've been trying to reach you all day.

371
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,750
The people from the press waited 
for over an hour.

372
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,416
And...

373
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,083
And?

374
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,833
I postponed the meeting
till 10:30 tomorrow.

375
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,000
You meet the union reps after that.

376
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,750
Cancel all appointments.

377
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,250
And one more thing, your father...

378
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,625
He's here.

379
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,875
I didn't know where to put him.

380
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,625
What are you doing here?

381
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,041
Why didn't you call first?

382
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:46,083
I wanted to talk to you.

383
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,458
-It won't take long.
-This is really a bad time.

384
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,458
You can just show up here.

385
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:56,208
Why don't you make an appointment
with my secretary that suits us both?

386
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,041
-Next week, for example.
-I have cancer.

387
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,375
Prostate.

388
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,000
I didn't want to upset you.

389
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,000
But now the cancer has spread.

390
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,958
And I thought

391
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,833
it's best if you know that.

392
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,500
I...

393
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,333
I don't know what to say.

394
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,708
It's okay.

395
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,708
I just wanted you to know.

396
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,666
I'll be on my way then.

397
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,791
I'm sure you have loads to do here.

398
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:48,458
Dad.

399
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,666
-You're back!
-Hello, my precocious princess.

400
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,750
Where's Mom?

401
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,875
You look sad.

402
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,625
Can you keep a secret?

403
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,916
I think I saw a witch today.

404
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,916
-There are no witches.
-There are!

405
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,750
This one was very real.

406
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,958
How did she look?

407
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,375
Long white hair.

408
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,333
Like in books.

409
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,708
And what did she say?

410
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,250
That she was sorry.

411
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,958
That doesn't sound like a witch.

412
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,041
How would you know?

413
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,250
You've never seen one.

414
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,750
Are those for Mom?

415
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,583
Yes.

416
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,791
You're too good a person, Dad.

417
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,458
The world doesn't deserve you.

418
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,958
Everything okay?

419
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,125
Yes.

420
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,083
It's just déjà vu.

421
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:22,250
I used to think the worst thing
that could happen to a person in life

422
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,666
is to lose your own child.

423
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,333
But we can't do anything about that.

424
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:35,916
No matter how hard we try
to hold on to them,

425
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,833
they still leave, sooner or later.

426
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,041
Parents...

427
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,000
Children...

428
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:51,041
They only share a common path
for a part of their lives.

429
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,375
In the end...

430
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,000
they are miles away from one another.

431
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,625
Last winter

432
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,541
a boy came to Winden.

433
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,583
A stranger.

434
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,583
He said something peculiar to me
at the time.

435
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,500
It makes no sense, but...

436
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,500
Maybe my cancer
is already driving me crazy.

437
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,875
Do you know this boy?

438
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,333
He's here?

439
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,958
Where is he?
You knew he was here?

440
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,500
You knew the whole time?

441
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,250
Where is he? Where is he?

442
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,916
Let go of me!

443
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,916
Where is Mikkel?

444
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,625
I'm closed for the day.

445
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,875
It's you!

446
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:28,958
I...

447
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,791
It's not ready yet.

448
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,000
It'll take another 33 years
before it's ready.

449
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,166
This thing... The blueprint...

450
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,125
I don't really understand what it is.

451
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,458
I've seen this before.

452
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:55,291
All our lives
we wonder what our journey will be.

453
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,541
This is yours.

454
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,958
-Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
-Why are you giving it to me?

455
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,666
I'll be dead soon.

456
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,708
I don't understand.

457
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,833
You will.

458
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,125
One day.

459
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,708
And then we'll meet again.

460
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,750
Before you die.

461
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,541
No. After that.

462
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:22,916
How...

463
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,333
How can that be possible?

464
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,125
Time is just an illusion.

465
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,583
Then you'll have to explain
the device to me.

466
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,291
But I don't know what it's for.
Why don't you tell me what it's for?

467
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:38,708
Because you told me
someone else explained it to you.

468
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,958
Things take their course,
as they always have.

469
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:46,708
No, I didn't tell you anything.
No one explained anything to me.

470
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,583
Not now, but in the future.

471
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,333
All this will come to an end soon.

472
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,625
But until then everything must remain
as it always has been.

473
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:01,500
Wait. Please.

474
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,958
You thought you could trust her.

475
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,041
She betrayed you.

476
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:11,583
She didn't even bat an eyelid.

477
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,666
You took everything from me.

478
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,833
You're going to die!

479
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,666
And everything you stand for
will die with you.

480
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,250
I know that I am going to die.

481
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,000
But am I going to lose this match?

482
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:33,083
Or is this here, our meeting,
you and your gun,

483
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:37,458
only part of a game
you still don't know how to play.

484
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,791
You think you can manipulate me
with your words.

485
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,291
I'm no longer one of your pawns.

486
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,750
But you're still one of Adam's.

487
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,958
The paradise he's promising you
is nothing but a lie.

488
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:57,458
He's selling you the illusion of freedom.

489
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,208
Ask yourself if you are really free.

490
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,541
If you were really free,

491
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,791
you'd have a choice.

492
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,916
Do you have a choice?

493
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:56,666
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

494
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,041
That can't be.

495
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,333
Charlotte?

496
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,166
That's not...

497
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,625
No, this isn't right.

498
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,708
This isn't true.

499
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,666
No matter how much we want to fight it,

500
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,333
we are connected through our blood.

501
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:35,750
We can be alienated from our families
and not understand their actions.

502
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:42,791
Still, in the end,
we would do anything for them.

503
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,500
A common thread

504
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:53,875
that connects all of our lives
with each other.

505
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,708
Did she have the pages on her?

506
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,208
She got what she deserved.

507
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:27,458
In the end, we all get what we deserve.

508
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:52,750
