00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:05,738
- <i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>
<i>named vandal savage</i>

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,374
<i>Conquered the world</i>
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,310
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>
<i>to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,811
<i>And stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,280
<i>Unfortunately, my plan</i>
<i>is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,384
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,</i>
<i>the time masters.</i>

7
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,652
<i>In the future, my friends</i>
<i>may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,588
<i>But if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,958
<i>They will be remembered</i>
<i>as legends.</i>

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,428
<i>- Previously on</i>
<i>"legends of tomorrow"...</i>

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,230
- Hold on to something!

12
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,068
- [grunting]

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,736
- I want to marry you, ray.

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,571
- Tragedy or heartbreak--

15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,441
That's how it always ends
if the man's not carter.

16
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,842
- [grunting]

17
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,843
Agh!

18
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,145
It's carter!

19
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,746
- He doesn't even
remember who he was.

20
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,415
- Kendra,
what are you waiting for?

21
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,151
- If I kill savage,
his mind will be lost.

22
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,318
[grunts]

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,487
<i>I'm so sorry, rip.</i>

24
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,590
[both grunt]
- who are you, gareeb?

25
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,928
[thunder crashing]

26

<i>â™ª</i> â™ª

28
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,442
- Ramses's men inform me
that you still refuse to speak,

29
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,212
To reveal your name
or why you tried to kill me.

30
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,314
Who are you?

31
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,385
- The man who is trying
to save the world from you.

32
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,887
- And how are your efforts
proceeding?

33
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,291
You can't even stand
for lack of food and water.

34
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,627
[laughing]

35
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,032
- I will always rise up
against you.

36
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,136
I will never give up.

37
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,005
- Soon the sky rocks
will lay waste to this kingdom,

38
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,175
And you along with it.

39
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,144
This cell will be your tomb.

40
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,885
What do you know of the future
that I don't, gareeb?

41
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,058
- [grunts]
mission...

42
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,659
Almost accomplished.

43
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,894
- That bottle of scotch
was given to me

44
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,030
By rob roy macgregor in 1689.

45
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,599
- It's not half bad.

46
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,268
- We should be toasting
to savage's death.

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,070
- Apart from celebrating murder,

48
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,038
Savage still has carter
brainwashed.

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
- I don't know if you've been
paying attention, professor,

50
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,543
But murdering savage
was always the plan.

51
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,179
- Besides, carter reincarnates,

52
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,947
Which is more
than I can say about us.

53
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,949
- As long as he's on board
and breathing,

54
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,520
Savage is a threat
to everyone on this ship.

55
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,221
- So what, we just kill savage

56
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,457
And leave carter
a brainless drone?

57
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,692
- Yes.

58
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,928
- Sorry we're late,
but we found something.

59
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
- We've been running diagnostics
on ray's suit

60
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,699
After his battle with savage's
rock 'em sock 'em robot.

61
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,568
- The telemetry data
included a comparative scan

62
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,903
Of the robot's tech.

63
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,538
- Amazing.
This neuromorphic profile

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,940
Is astonishingly futuristic.

65
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,042
- Yeah, it's from 2166.

66
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,911
- Well, that's the thing.
It's not.

67
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,279
- This technology's light years
more advanced

68
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,047
Than anything from 2166.

69
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,583
- Who cares?
- The time masters.

70
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,418
They refused to take
action against savage

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,320
Because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

72
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,621
- But if he comes

73
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,490
Into possession
of future technology...

74
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,659
- It means he's been engaging
in exactly the same manipulation

75
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,128
Of time that the time council
were designed to prevent.

76
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,330
- So now they'll finally
sign off on undoing

77
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,065
All the damage savage
has done to the world.

78
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,900
- Last time I checked,
the time council

79
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,502
Was at the edge
of the timeline,

80
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,470
And this bucket of bolts

81
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,639
Can barely hold it together
as it is.

82
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,175
- Gideon, what's the status
of the time drive?

83
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,510
<i>- Stable, captain.</i>

84
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,946
- Plot a course
for the vanishing point.

85
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:39,151
Tonight, vandal savage
faces justice for his crimes.

86
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,989

<i>â™ª</i> â™ª

88
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:54,700
- Quite the reversal of fortune,
isn't it, gareeb?

89
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,370
4,000 years ago it was you
who was the prisoner.

90
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,005
Ever since I met you again,

91
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,275
I've always wondered
how you managed to escape.

92
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,010
- Another time, perhaps.
For the moment,

93
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,845
I'm more interested in this.

94
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,948
The brains
to your robot super-weapon.

95
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,617
At least a century more advanced

96
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,486
Than anything
to be found in 2166.

97
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,722
- Do you have something
to ask me?

98
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,460
- How did you obtain the ability
to travel through time?

99
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,964
- From you.

100
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,033
When I saw you again in 1975,

101
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:33,038
I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,074
You showed a caveman fire.

103
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,410
And I had almost 200 years

104
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,712
To figure out
how to strike the flame.

105
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,980
- All this time,
I've been wondering

106
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,248
Why it was so difficult

107
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,916
To locate you
throughout history.

108
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,754
Because you've been
moving through history.

109
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,889
- Well, you'll come to learn

110
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,858
That this is just one
of many things

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,728
We have in common, gareeb.

112
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,031
We're both doing
what we must to save the world.

113
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,868
- Subjugating the world
to your rule is not saving it.

114
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,771
You would create a wasteland
and call it peace.

115
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:10,108
- Do not misquote tacitus
to me.

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,710
I knew him well.

117
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,512
I have lived long enough

118
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,782
To watch civilizations
rise and fall.

119
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,951
You weep for your son.

120
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,689
I have held dozens
of my children

121
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,692
As they perished from old age.

122
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,628
You might be a time master,

123
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,764
But I'm a master of time.

124
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,633
And I play a far deeper game

125
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,101
Than you could ever hope
to comprehend.

126
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,207
- Gideon, go to maximum
on the time drive.

127
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,810
<i>- Inadvisable, captain.</i>
<i>When dr. Palmer siphoned power</i>

128
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,478
<i>From the auxiliary time drive,</i>
<i>he reduced the ship--</i>

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,146
- Gideon!
Take us to maximum.

130
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,214
We need to get
to the vanishing point

131
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,882
As fast as possible.

132
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,222
- Where am I?
- Somewhere safe.

133
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,057
- Safe as long
as those cuffs hold.

134
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,960
- Do you know who you are?

135
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,064
- I'm scythian torvil,

136
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,667
Adjunct to lord savage.

137
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,901
And you will release me,

138
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,270
Or I will kill you
where you stand.

139
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,241
- Your name is carter hall.

140
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,810
You used to be prince khufu
of the middle kingdom.

141
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,811
And I am--

142
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,447
- Kendra saunders.

143
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,450
Oh, you seem surprised.

144
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,653
You didn't think lord savage
would warn me of my enemies?

145
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,656
Let me go and I promise you
I will show mercy.

146
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,393
I will kill you without
making you suffer first.

147
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,833
[ship rumbling]

148
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,268
- Not to sound
like a six-year-old,

149
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,103
But are we there yet?

150
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,640
- No, the waverider was severely
damaged in savage's last attack.

151
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,243
- Yeah, I can tell by the way
she's flying.

152
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,981
You sure you're not
pushing her too hard?

153
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,383
- The longer savage
is on board the ship,

154
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,886
The greater the danger
to all of us.

155
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,557
- To us, or your family?

156
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,492
I checked with gideon.

157
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,061
Bringing savage onboard
didn't change the timeline,

158
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,663
And your family still dies.

159
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,498
- The timeline is
always in flux.

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,499
Once we get
to the vanishing point,

161
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,234
All will be well.

162
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,970
- Is that why you're pushing
the ship beyond its limits?

163
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,540
- This has been my ship
for the last 13 years.

164
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,408
No one knows its limits
better than I do.

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,743
Not even gideon.

166
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,877
The waverider
will hold together.

167
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,813
I promise you.

To what do I owe

how to free carter's mind.

all you had to do was ask.

Are you sure you want me to?

357

358

I release him,

You will lose her forever.

And I know the man who stands
between you and your love

You're insane.

366
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,189
- But yet chay-ara once loved me
as she professes to love you.

Oh, you didn't know that,

I don't even think
chay-ara remembers,

But 4,000 years ago

370
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,534
I discovered that my chay-ara
had been reborn

371

But with no memory
of what had happened.

372
