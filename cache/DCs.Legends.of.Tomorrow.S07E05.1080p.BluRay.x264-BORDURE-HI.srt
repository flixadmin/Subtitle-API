1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,367
[man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our destination.</i>

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,549
<i>Welcome to New York City.</i>

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:09,344
- Taxi!
- [horns honking]

4
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,727
[Gary] Legends, we made it!

5
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:33,576
[clicks, whooshes]

6
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,119
Legends.

7
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,539
- We made it.
- Thanks, we heard you the first time.

8
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,124
- And every other time.
- I appreciated all your updates.

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,416
Thanks.

10
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,712
Uh... Nate and Zari aren't coming?

11
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,440
What are they doing?
Did they say something?

12
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:47,966
Hoover-Bot's still stonewalling us,

13
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,777
so they're tinkering,
trying to figure out who sent him.

14
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,986
- Why are you so concerned?
- Oh.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,887
I'm not concerned. I'm just, you know,

16
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,306
emotionally invested
in their love story.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,618
[Behrad] I can't believe
we're finally in New York.

18
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,936
We're so close to getting a time machine
and going home.

19
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,622
Okay, first,
we've got to find Dr. Gwyn Davies.

20
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,106
So, let's get a city map, yeah?

21
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,442
Can we also please find some pizza
or something that's not John's whiskey?

22
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,070
Ooh, I saw an ice-cream stand
near the park.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,281
[indistinct chattering]

24
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,869
Mmm. I miss classic New York pizza.

25
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,164
It's all squash blossoms
and cauliflower crust in 2044.

26
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,041
Yeah. Why couldn't
John's manor dimension

27
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,835
have had unlimited Pizza Shack?

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,047
Uh, manor dimension? 2044?

29
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,091
Pizza Shack?

30
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,093
Where are you kids from?

31
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,345
Oh, um, we're just tourists from...

32
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,264
Uh, Canada. Eh?

33
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,018
Sorry. How much do we owe ya?

34
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,769
[stutters] You're not Canadians.

35
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,188
[chuckles] The Canadians,
they're good people.

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,609
You're outlaws, and I'm gonna stop you!

37
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,693
- Uh-huh.
- [gun cocks]

38
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,861
- [gunshot]
- [Sara grunts]

39
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,533
[groaning]

40
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,430
[Agent Sharpe] Come here. Come here.

41
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,454
[groaning]

42
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,925
- [Agent Sharpe] Careful. Careful.
- [grunts]

43
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,084
[breathes heavily] Okay.

44
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,128
[indistinct conversation]

45
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,504
[Sara] Okay, I'm fine.

46
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,841
I got the map.
Let's just get to the manor.

47
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,844
[digital beeping]

48
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,644
Whatever you're doing back there,
you can't hurt me.

49
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:23,936
I'm impervious to pain.

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,396
Oh, I believe it.

51
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,026
Wow, you mastered that Hoover tech
real quick.

52
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,129
Yeah, well, the code
is the same as the <i>Waverider's.</i>

53
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,197
In fact, see this blue chip?

54
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,449
We have chips like this
all over the <i>Waverider.</i>

55
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,787
So we can confirm that the <i>Waverider</i>
who shot our <i>Waverider</i>

56
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,748
is making the Hoover-Bots,
but the question is still who and why.

57
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,335
Yeah, well, if this computer I stole
from John's attic wasn't so retro,

58
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,878
I would have an answer to that.

59
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,756
I was sent by the United States
government to uphold the law.

60
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,300
- Hmm.
- He still thinks he's the real Hoover?

61
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,095
Yeah, I even put up a mirror
to show him his tech.

62
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,888
He accused me of subversion.

63
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,099
You deserve a break. [clears throat]

64
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,184
[Zari] Donuts?

65
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,644
Where'd you get donuts?

66
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,812
John's attic.

67
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,580
Kidding. Gary stole them off the train.

68
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,524
Ah! Genius!

69
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,443
Oh, my God, Sara!

70
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,362
I'm fine. We got too casual,

71
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,489
forgot the Bullet Blondes
are still front page news.

72
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,573
Not gonna happen again.

73
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,297
Yes, you might be fine,
but I'm finding it

74
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:23,371
very hard to erase the image of my wife
being shot by a trigger-happy local.

75
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,831
Sounds more like a patriot to me.

76
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,207
Can we mute him?

77
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,143
I can't deal
with his negative energy right now.

78
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,711
Yeah, gladly. [grunts]

79
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,685
[Hoover-Bot]
Sounds like an American hero.

80
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:33,954
Sounds like some... [inaudible]

81
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,341
[Gary mumbles]

82
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,094
[whispering] So,
have you and Zari talked next steps?

83
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,031
[whispering] No, I don't know what to
say and I don't want to ruin the vibe.

84
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,950
[Gary] You're ruining the vibe
by not saying anything.

85
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,368
This is the last time
I sneak you train donuts.

86
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,144
The hell you will!
You're my donut dealer.

87
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,105
Hey, what are you two whispering about?

88
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,817
Oh, um, the mission, the Bullet Blondes
are still front page news.

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,236
We've got to find this Dr. Davies
as fast as we can.

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,320
[Sara] He's right.

91
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,699
And we located Edison Labs,
which is where Davies worked

92
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,635
when he came up
with the foundation for time travel.

93
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,035
Great. Just get us his research,

94
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,305
and we'll use our future knowledge
to build what he's come up with.

95
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,457
Then we can time travel out of 1925.

96
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,000
[Agent Sharpe] Wonderful.

97
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,753
While you regain your strength,
I'll go get Davies' research.

98
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,921
Actually, I'm going, you're staying.

99
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,299
What? No way. You just got shot.

100
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,802
Babe, our faces are literally
on the front of every single newspaper.

101
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,722
If someone recognizes us again
and decides to take a shot,

102
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,016
I'm the only one
who's gonna be able to survive that.

103
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,769
[sighs] Fine, but no footprints.

104
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,312
Davies is the father of time travel.

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
If you mess up his timeline, no amount
of IOUs in the world can fix it.

106
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,691
You got it.

107
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:34,776
[exhales]

108
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,152
[indistinct chattering]

109
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,446
- Which one's Davies?
- No clue.

110
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,448
Time Bureau manual
didn't have a picture of him.

111
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,575
[grunts]

112
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,078
But if I had to guess, I'd say that guy.

113
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:50,500
Looks familiar, kind of like Mick,
but with hair.

114
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,794
I'd say more of a young Stein.

115
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,213
But regardless, he's clutching
his briefcase to his chest

116
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,815
like it has something important in it.

117
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,675
- The basis of time travel?
- Mm-hmm. Wait here.

118
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,970
[clears throat] Excuse me, uh,
Dr. Gwyn Davies?

119
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,389
That's Dr. Gwyn Davies.
What is it you want?

120
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,767
I am a huge fan of your work,

121
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,078
and I would just love
to pick your brain over a cup of...

122
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,355
Yes, yes, yes,
I'm not here to socialize, young lady.

123
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,399
I'm here to make some very important
discoveries for Mr. Edison.

124
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,610
- Now, excuse me. Thank you.
- Of course.

125
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,863
- [exclaims]
- Oh! I am so sorry.

126
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,324
Oh, wait,
was that an accent that I detected?

127
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,117
- Good day to you.
- Oh, um...

128
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,577
Keep up the good work.

129
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,999
Did you get it?

130
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,128
Couldn't have been easier.

131
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,256
[theme music playing]

132
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,794
[Spooner]
We've been trying to hitchhike for days

133
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,528
and literally nobody has stopped.

134
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,322
We must get to Dr. Gwyn Davies
by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,

135
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,615
or the Legends will die.

136
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,785
At our current pace,
we'll get to him in two weeks.

137
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,287
[speaking Spanish]

138
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,580
[vehicle approaching]

139

Spooner.

[speaking Spanish]

141
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,723
Why can't you
just bring us some good luck, man?

142
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,644
Who are you conversing with?
Is there someone up there?

143
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,272
Hello! I'm Gideon.

144
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,983
Fine. I didn't want to do this,
but you leave me no choice.

145
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,489
[chanting spell]

146
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,995
I just performed a luck spell.

147
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,705
Now, this rock will bring us good luck.

148
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,998
Wait, you can do that?

149
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,583
Obviously, I'm a witch.

150
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,169
Isn't luck just an interpretation
of random occurrences?

151
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,744
How can a spell generate that?

152
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,339
How can a spell generate anything?

153
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,549
- All I know is it works.
- [vehicle approaching]

154
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,884
Spooner...

155
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,392
It works!

156
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,854
[Behrad]
These blueprints are incredible.

157
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,648
It's like Da Vinci's helicopter sketch.

158
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,067
[Sara] Okay,
how long to build the Timeship?

159
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,277
Davies' instructions
are really thorough.

160
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,614
- I'd say four, no, five...
- Weeks?

161
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,117
- Months?
- Uh, years.

162
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,201
Five years?

163
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,206
You're asking us to build a time machine
from scratch in 1925.

164
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,583
[sighs] We're never gonna
get back to 2021.

165
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,545
Look... It's not impossible.
It's just gonna take a little while.

166
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,089
No, you're right.

167
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,026
[exhales] And at least we have
an unlimited supply of booze,

168
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,152
'cause I need to get liquored up.

169
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,176
I totally support that

170
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,805
after you ninja Davies' files
back into his apartment.

171
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,682
You want me to do this now?

172
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,183
Yes. Small footprints, babe.

173
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,310
We can't risk altering
time travel history.

174
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,062
It could jeopardize
our entire existence.

175
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,815
Okay, fine.

176
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,527
- And then I'm getting liquored up.
- Goodbye.

177
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,364
[object clattering]

178
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:10,991
[snoring]

179
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,473
Now go about your life

180
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,809
and we'll build
your time machine for you.

181
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,066
[chuckles]

182
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,359
[upbeat music playing]

183
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,782
Or you'll build it for us.

184
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,709
[sighs] You guys, his time machine
is literally sitting there,

185
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,794
just begging to be used.

186
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,088
Hold on, we can't use it yet.

187
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:09,008
According to Davies' notes,
we're still missing one part.

188
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,444
Who's game for a scavenger hunt?

189
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,970
Huh! I love scavenger hunts

190
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,473
because I love giving myself
to all things.

191
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,224
Games.

192
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,559
People.

193
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:23,439
Did you and Gary hook up?
I won't be mad. I will be confused.

194
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,651
Just checking.

195
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,821
Davies' notes also say
he got all his parts from Edison Labs.

196
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,466
I bet that's where
we find the missing one.

197
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,617
Scavenger hunt just got way easier.

198
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,701
Wait, wait.

199
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,621
I am also dying to get to 2021,
but no footprints, remember?

200
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,706
Babe, I respect your no footprints plan.

201
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,334
And, yes, we could wait five years
for the Tarazis

202
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,128
to build a time machine
that may or may not work. No offense.

203
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,522
- None taken.
- Slightly offended.

204
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:52,093
Or we could leave a tiny footprint
and get out of here way earlier.

205
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,178
It's not gonna be tiny.
Can you slow down?

206
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,489
We're just trying
to get all the information.

207
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,948
For instance, this is very interesting.

208
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,059
The manual says that Davies
laid the foundation for time travel.

209
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,602
If he built a time machine,

210
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,396
why doesn't it say
that he invented time travel?

211
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
Maybe he time travelled somewhere,
couldn't recharge and got stuck there.

212
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,235
Ah, that makes sense.

213
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,797
That's why he never got credit
because no one ever knew he succeeded.

214
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,448
But if we time travel to the future,
we can recharge it.

215
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,034
Plus, we'll pick up some Time Couriers,
and we'll get back,

216
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,745
and we'll return the machine,
and he'll be none the wiser.

217
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,208
Babe, we would have time travel again.

218
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,353
And I know it's a footprint,
but it's a tiny footprint.

219
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,839
It's like a baby footprint,
and everyone loves baby footprints.

220
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,757
[sighs]

221
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,220
The clutch is slipping.

222
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,848
I have no idea what that means,
but I assume it's bad.

223
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,516
- Can you fix it?
- No, there's no time.

224
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,119
And we won't be able
to get out of first gear.

225
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,311
So, the max we can go
is like 20 miles per hour.

226
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,897
How fast do we need to drive
to get to New York?

227
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,209
Well, to prevent the Legends
from blowing up in Davies' time machine

228
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,609
due to electrical overload,

229
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,823
we should maintain a conservative pace
of no less than 55 miles per hour.

230
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,906
Maybe we can, I don't know,
find a mechanic?

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,285
There's no need.

232
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,995
We've got our lucky rock, remember?

233
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,572
I'm still not convinced
there's any such thing as luck.

234
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,786
Only the ability
to cope with a statistical universe.

235
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,126
Ah!

236
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,961
You'll see. Watch.

237
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,926
Come on, rock, bring us some more luck.

238
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,193
Good afternoon, ladies.

239
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,321
Name's Erwin George Baker,
but you can call me Cannon Ball.

240
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,283
Cannon Ball?
As in the cross country race car driver?

241
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,617
You've heard of me!

242
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,204
I'm a big NASCAR... I mean, racing fan.

243
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,455
[chuckles]

244
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,373
Well, y'all wouldn't happen to know

245
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
the fastest route through Cleveland,
now would you?

246
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,854
I'm actually in the middle
of trying to break my own record,

247
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,130
driving from LA to New York.

248
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,007
Well, I think I made a wrong turn.

249
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,927
New York, did you say?

250
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,947
We're actually on our way there, too.

251
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,115
[Gideon] Well,
the fastest route to New York

252
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,308
is south on Highway 15
till it merges with Highway 40,

253
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,311
then cut through Columbus,
not Cleveland, on the 90.

254
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,480
[chuckling] Oh, dang!

255
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,316
You sure know your directions, miss.

256
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,362
I'll tell you what,
if y'all help me get to the highway,

257
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,657
I'll let you race with me
all the way to New York.

258
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,201
- Shotgun.
- All right!

259
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,286
Come on!

260
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,206
Ah, I love scavenger hunts.

261
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,769
Are we playing teams or head-to-head?

262
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,709
Neither. You're on your own
finding that part.

263
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,961
What are you gonna do?

264
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,088
Make sure that the doc
stays here all night.

265
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,851
We can't have him walking in on us
building his time machine, right?

266
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,094
- How are you gonna keep him here?
- Uh...

267
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,848
Hmm.

268
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,768
[Sara humming]

269
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:49,686
[Dr. Davies sighs]

270
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:54,358
[stutters] I told you, I am not here
to socialize, young lady. Thank you.

271
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:57,921
I beg your pardon?
What do you think you're doing?

272
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,990
You see, this is my desk.
It is not a rubbish tip.

273
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh. You didn't hear?

274
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:08,330
They want your opinion on which
of these projects is best by tomorrow.

275
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,415
[chuckles] Yes.

276
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,916
Who wants it?

277
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,126
Not Edison?

278
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,671
Oh, this came straight
from Edison himself.

279
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,633
- [sighs]
- Oh. And these.

280
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,510
Tomorrow.

281
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,767
What do we have here?

282
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,527
I truly am the world's
greatest scavenger hunter.

283
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,779
[exclaims]

284
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,616
- I should be out there.
- Sara's gonna be fine.

285
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,036
She's a half-alien ninja
in a building full of scientists.

286
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,954
An illegal alien?

287
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,638
You degenerates
are worse than I thought.

288
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,207
Would you just shut up?

289
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,335
You're not even the real Hoover.
You are a robot.

290
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,688
If you'd just tell us who sent you
and who blew up our <i>Waverider,</i>

291
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,880
we could be rid of you.

292
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:01,050
You can't get rid of me.
I'll hunt you until my dying breath.

293
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,301
[shushes]

294
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,179
I still don't know who sent him,
or who blew up the <i>Waverider,</i>

295
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,265
but I did find a to-do list
in his programming.

296
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,435
- Tax convention at 3:00 p.m.?
- I'm missing that?

297
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,520
You'll pay for this.

298
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,066
Uh... There's an item
that supersedes everything else.

299
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,275
[keyboard clacking]

300
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,280
Oh.

301
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,701
Wait. So, if he's here to kill us,

302
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,471
but he's also here
to replace the old Hoover

303
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,135
and do everything
that the old Hoover did,

304
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,165
does that mean that the person
that wants us dead

305
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,792
is trying to protect the timeline?

306
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,211
Why would someone
who's trying to protect the timeline

307
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,379
want us dead?

308
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,547
Protecting the timeline
is literally our job.

309
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:41,983
[Agent Sharpe] I don't know,

310
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,551
but any noticeable footprints
and they'll know that it's us,

311
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,595
and they'll come back to finish the job.

312
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,059
Have you seen Dr. Parker?

313
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,186
Um...

314
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,646
No?

315
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,022
You must be new.

316
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,106
I'm Mr. Edison.

317
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,110
Edison? Thomas Edison?

318
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,029
- What's your name?
- Gary Green. [chuckles]

319
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,365
Dr. Gary Green.

320
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,660
Well, Dr. Green, at Edison Labs,

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,913
we log out parts
from the parts department.

322
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,124
- Oh.
- Let me show you.

323
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,128
- Who's your supervisor?
- Uh, Dr. Gwyn Davies.

324
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,213
- Davies?
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,589
What project is this for?

326
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,008
Oh, it's the time travel project,
of course.

327
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,138
[man] <i>Front desk.</i>

328
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,140
Have security meet me at Davies' office.

329
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,433
<i>Yes, sir, right away.</i>

330
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,019
[mumbles]

331
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,110
What Edison's asking me to do,
it will keep me here all night.

332
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,695
I suggest you get started, then.

333
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,655
[grunts]

334
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,740
[speaking gibberish]

335
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,829
- Uh, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

336
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,080
[continues indistinctly]

337
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,251
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah, please, just don't touch me.

338
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,129
Confiscate everything!

339
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,173
No, no, no, no.

340
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,716
Not my work. No!

341
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,683
I've told you,
this time travel is a fool's errand.

342
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,519
But you've been
drafting blueprints at work

343
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,271
and stealing company parts.

344
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,441
Just let me complete it,
Mr. Edison, please.

345
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,817
I beg of you.

346
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,360
You're terminated, Davies.

347
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,654
These men will escort you
off the premises,

348
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,032
and I am personally burning this.

349
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,367
You couldn't possibly understand!

350
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,162
Time travel is my divine mission!

351
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,788
You can't take that away for me!

352
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,290
Take him to Bellevue.

353
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,460
It's apparent he's lost his damn mind.

354
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,254
I'm perfectly sane.
You get your hands off me!

355
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,965
You brutes! Get your hands off me!

356
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,967
- [breathes heavily]
- [door closes]

357
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,474
[engine revving]

358
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,777
[Astra] Put your hand down.

359
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,488
We received calls
from the last 10 towns over

360
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,241
about a speed demon headed this way.

361
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,993
License and registration.

362
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,538
Now, Officer,
allow me to introduce myself.

363
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,331
Name is Erwin George...

364
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,376
I don't care
if you're the pope of Pennsylvania.

365
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,877
License and registration.

366
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,035
We need to get back on the road.

367
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,008
We'll be fine. We've got our lucky rock.

368
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,570
You all need to step out of the vehicle.

369
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,557
I'm taking you in
and impounding your car.

370
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,475
[Astra] Uh, wait, wait.

371
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,395
[grunts] You're making a huge mistake.

372
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,815
Erwin's cross country races
are all over the newspapers.

373
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,110
In fact, he is in the process
of breaking the current record.

374
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,154
Article after article
is being written about it.

375
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,031
Now, you could arrest him

376
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:57,077
and be forever known as the cop
who arrested a legend.

377
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:01,415
Or you could let us go and be hailed

378
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:05,544
as the cop who gave Cannon Ball
a police escort to the county line.

379
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,841
You'll mention my name in the paper?

380
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,884
Absolutely.

381
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,513
Then let's get yous to that county line.

382
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,555
[Astra] Uh, yes!

383
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,196
[Erwin] That lucky rock
sure is something.

384
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,769
- And it is gonna help me beat my record.
- Whoo!

385
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,730
[whooping]

386
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,070
You thinking about Gary again?

387
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,948
Oddly enough, I am.

388
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Please say more.

389
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,537
Actually, Gary and I had
a surprisingly enlightening conversation

390
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,872
prior to your arrival.

391
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,624
That is surprising.

392
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,584
What'd you talk about?

393
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,337
He made me realize
that I've been using your Totem

394
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,756
as an excuse not to take the next step.

395
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,048
[sighs]

396
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,137
I see, we're having that talk.

397
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,017
Hey, listen,
now we don't have to have it.

398
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,707
We've had a really good few days,
and I don't want to ruin it.

399
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,732
No, we... we're always great together.

400
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,526
It's being apart, that makes it... hard.

401
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,195
I know.

402
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,909
I know a way for us to be together,

403
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,453
and it's... this place.

404
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,542
Like here?
Like John's pocket manor dimension?

405
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,878
Uh-huh. Our problem
is that you and other Zari

406
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,964
can't co-exist
without Behrad's head exploding. Okay?

407
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,176
But in this dimension,
time and space doesn't exist.

408
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,053
We don't have to worry about that.

409
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,513
What do you think?

410
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,808
I think it's a great idea.

411
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,017
You seem stunned.

412
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,227
I am... Uh...

413
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,372
We can finally live together.

414
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,438
- Right?
- It's a win.

415
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,190
- It's a win.
- Hmm.

416
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,317
Really? A fist bump? It's bigger than...

417
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,070
- Nah, I got jokes.
- You got jokes?

418
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,120
But on a serious note,
I got a surprise for you.

419
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,469
- Another one? [chuckles softly]
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,661
Okay.

421
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,870
I saved you a bear claw.

422
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,291
- Who loves you?
- You. [chuckles softly]

423
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,960
[exhales]

424
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,381
I'm trained to read people.

425
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,758
That was a fine acting performance.

426
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,344
Shut up, Hoover. I wasn't acting.

427
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,723
There you go again.

428
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,976
You might get your lies past him,
but not me.

429
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,572
Uh, what day is today?

430
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,824
It's November 7th. Why?

431
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,451
He was planning to use it tonight.

432
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,995
[Sara] No wonder he was so upset.

433
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,121
Okay, but this is fine,

434
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,141
because if we use
the time machine tonight instead,

435
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,459
then history will stay on track.

436
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,669
[Behrad] Co-captains.

437
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,880
Necrian.

438
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,258
I present the world's
very first time machine.

439
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,384
[machine starts]

440
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,264
[exhales]

441
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,147
Wait, Sara, that means...

442
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,231
No!

443
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,777
Where is she?

444
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,904
No, no, no, no!

445
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,616
Wait, they disappeared
when I put this in,

446
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:23,992
so if I take it out...

447
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,242
[machine stops]

448
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,764
- Why aren't they back?
- Because we caused too many footprints.

449
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,540
God, this is all my fault.

450
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,167
- Okay.
- [sighs]

451
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,920
- Why are we still here?
- I don't know.

452
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,047
But, look, if Ava and...
If they're gone,

453
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,424
then that means
that the Time Bureau never existed.

454
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,675
That means that...

455
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,262
Which means that I never meet Ava.

456
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,516
We need to fix this.

457
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,439
We need to cover all of our footsteps
and make sure that history happens

458
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,895
exactly how it's supposed to.

459
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,731
Stay here and uninstall that last part.

460
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,167
We're not gonna use the time machine?

461
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,193
No, we will,
but we need Davies to install it

462
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,654
and take his maiden voyage
like history intended.

463
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,633
Wait, you're gonna break him
out of a mental institution?

464
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,118
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, wait, Edison took all of his files.

465
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,471
It's all good, we made a copy.

466
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,639
No, no, no. It's not all good.

467
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,432
It was the originals
that were passed on from history

468
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,376
and it's the originals that inspired
the invention of time travel.

469
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,937
We have to get those back from Edison.

470
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,004
Okay. It's a lot to do,
but it's not impossible.

471
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,548
We have until 7:00 p.m.

472
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,175
- That's a little more impossible.
- [sighs]

473
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,719
Then it's time for all hands on deck,

474
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,055
human and robot.

475
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,854
Hey, you guys muted him.
Can you get him to do or say things?

476
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:37,107
He has a to-do list.
In theory, I could replace what's on it.

477
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,860
Replace it. We need him
to get Davies' plans from Edison,

478
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,528
and Edison's gonna be more likely

479
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,575
to give the plans to Hoover
than he would to us.

480
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,117
Okay, uh, goodbye
"eliminate the Legends,"

481
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,702
bye-bye "tax convention"...

482
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,288
Don't you dare! I will ruin...

483
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,957
You know, I don't know
why I keep unmuting you.

484
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,377
All right, I'm gonna grab some clothes,
so we can accompany Hoover.

485
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,522
It's shocking how much stuff
John has in that attic.

486
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,547
Hey.

487
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,675
You think he has a lab coat?

488
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,095
[indistinct chatter]

489
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,429
[indistinct laughter]

490
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:11,765
[indistinct shouting]

491
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,399
[mumbling]

492
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,527
No, no, no,
what the devil are you doing in here?

493
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,030
Getting you out of here.
The fan girl stuff was just an act.

494
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,948
I'm actually a time traveler.

495
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,452
[chuckles] A time traveler?
Is this some kind of sick joke?

496
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,204
Edison put you up to it, didn't he?
The blasphemer!

497
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,749
This isn't a joke, all right?
I'm from 2021.

498
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,918
And I know that
you invented time travel,

499
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,337
and your maiden voyage
is tonight at 7:00,

500
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,380
so I'll get you back to your apartment

501
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,104
so we can use your time machine.
Let's go.

502
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,636
Do you honestly expect me to believe
a word that's coming out of your mouth?

503
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,055
You lied to me.
This is all just more lies.

504
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,866
Come on, you'll see when you get there.

505
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,170
I'm not going anywhere with you.

506
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,944
- No, listen, you don't understand...
- I don't think you understand.

507
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,356
I built my time machine
for a sacred purpose,

508
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,192
and I'll be damned
if I'm letting a two-bit liar use it.

509
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,711
We do not have time for this, all right?

510
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,487
If you don't come with me,
then history...

511
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,989
[stutters] What are you not getting?

512
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:12,035
You see,
I am not going anywhere with you.

513
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,747
As a matter of fact...
Guards! Help! Intruder!

514
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,082
- Hey!
- [gasps]

515
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,249
[shushes]

516
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,753
Be quiet.

517
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,468
- [shushes]
- Okay.

518
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:33,056
Now, I will let you go
if you stop screaming.

519
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,224
Do you understand?

520
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,600
I promise.

521
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,102
[gasping, breathing heavily]

522
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,815
Okay, all right, hey, hey.

523
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,902
It's all right, hey, look. Calm down.
You're having a panic attack, okay?

524
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,696
You just need to
focus on your breathing.

525
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:48,780
Okay.

526
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,240
Okay. [breathing heavily]

527
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,081
Okay, look, hey. Hey.

528
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,709
I'm sorry, okay?

529
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,212
I've been treating you like a pawn
instead of a person,

530
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,630
and it's not fair.

531
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,675
You are a really big deal, all right?

532
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,386
Hey, you invented freaking time travel

533
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,639
and it's because of you
that so many things become possible,

534
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,933
including me meeting my wife.

535
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,478
You married a woman?

536
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:21,938
Yeah. [chuckles]

537
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,484
Still getting used to saying that.
We just got married.

538
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,529
Look...

539
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,200
I messed up
and she disappeared from the timeline.

540
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,536
And so, now,
I have a sacred purpose, too,

541
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,288
to bring her back.

542
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,666
And the only way that that could happen
is if you come with me,

543
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,253
or otherwise, she could be gone forever.

544
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,633
So please believe me when I say
that I am done lying to you.

545
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,558
I can understand doing anything
to save the person you love.

546
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,688
It's actually why I was trying
to invent time travel.

547
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,023
[clears throat]

548
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,526
So let's do it.

549
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:09,944
What do you say?

550
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,446
Help me save my person?

551
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:19,329
If I help you save your person,
you help me save mine.

552
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,749
[sighs] You're only gonna come with me
if I say yes, right?

553
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,918
Mm-hmm. We have a deal then.

554
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,465
Let's get the hell out of here.

555
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,760
- Yes, indeed.
- And wash our hands.

556
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,724
I don't know, Zari.
He's still giving me Terminator vibes.

557
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,103
I hear that, but he's on our side now.

558
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,397
I reprogrammed him to get
Edison's plans, among other tweaks.

559
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,819
Yikes.

560
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,445
Any way to make that less toothy?

561
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:53,947
Watch this.

562
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,411
After you.

563
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,662
Oh!

564
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,587
I don't understand why

565
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,882
you'd be interested in
Dr. Davies' plans, Mr. Hoover.

566
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:17,387
Believe me,
they're just the ravings of a madman.

567
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,972
I was just about to destroy them.

568
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,836
Thank you very much, Mr. Edison.

569
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,434
I'm sure you're probably right.

570
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,855
Yeah.

571
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,777
I'm just a little confused, Mr. Hoover.

572
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,113
Why would someone of your stature...

573
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,782
bother to come here?

574
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,661
Unless you have something
more important on your agenda nearby.

575
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,621
I came here for a...

576
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,626
- [Nate clears throat]
- Sir? Sir?

577
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,044
[stutters]

578
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,589
Tax convention at 3:00 p.m.

579
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,716
Mr. Hoover, are you okay?

580
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,467
Yeah. Sir, he's fine.

581
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,304
You know,
he suffers from low blood sugar.

582
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,847
I'm here for a tax Convention.

583
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,348
I'm here to retrieve the plans.

584
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,726
I'm here to r... retrieve the plans.

585
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,477
I'm here for a Tax Convention.

586
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,396
I'm here to retrieve the plans.

587
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,858
[machinery beeping]

588
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,193
[crackling]

589
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,036
Um... [clears throat]

590
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,288
I can explain everything, Mr. Edison.

591
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,750
Great Scott!

592
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,752
- [gasps]
- Oh!

593
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:31,753
Mr. Edison!

594
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,630
Oh, God!

595
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,715
He's dead.

596
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,176
Oh, my God.

597
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,904
[doctor]
It's imperative that we find him!

598
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,054
[continues indistinctly]

599
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,349
There.

600
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,683
[upbeat music playing]

601
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,186
[Dr. Davies grunts]

602
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:53,024
- Come on.
- I am a scientist, not an athlete!

603
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,654
We'll just take as much Hoover-Bot tech
as we can.

604
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,782
I can still use it to try to figure out
who sent him here.

605
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,409
Why do you think the Hoover-Bot
short circuited?

606
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,204
He was being pulled
in two different directions

607
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,289
that he couldn't reconcile...

608
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,501
Like our relationship.

609
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:19,717
Nate, I know I'm not super great
at expressing my feelings,

610
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,720
but I have to tell you something.

611
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,561
You're getting cold feet
about living together.

612
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:30,853
No. What? No, no, no, no.
Dude, that's literally all I want.

613
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,439
But in the Totem,

614
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,275
not the manor.

615
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,403
No one is more surprised about this
than me.

616
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,239
I found a real community there.

617
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,992
I feel like I'm part of a family.

618
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,911
Somehow, over the last two years...

619
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,706
It feels like home.

620
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,292
[exhales] Okay. Um... [clears throat]

621
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,836
Can I get a little bit of time to digest

622
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,088
what it would be like
living out of a Totem?

623
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,299
Yeah. Completely.

624
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,542
[stutters] This reality
we're navigating, it is insane.

625
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,927
- It's insane.
- Yeah.

626
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,096
- Just take much time as you need.
- Okay.

627
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,352
And, well, there's no rush
on your decision.

628
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,854
We should probably get out of here.

629
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,177
- Yeah.
- Right. [clears throat]

630
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:15,982
Okay.

631
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:17,441
[thuds]

632
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,863
Too late.

633
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,448
[both panting]

634
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,385
No, no, no.
We're trapped. We're trapped.

635
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,244
Okay, you're supposed
to be a genius, right?

636
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,471
You can think of a way out of here.

637
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,581
Genius? They think I'm a lunatic...

638
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:33,958
They think I'm a lunatic.

639
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,335
[doctor] He went this way!

640
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,255
- [yelps] Oh, my God!
- Get back.

641
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,299
I'm as mad as a hatter. I shall cut her.

642
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,634
- Back. Get back.
- Please listen to him. He's crazy.

643
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,554
I swear with all my might, I'll do it!

644
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,972
He's gonna do it!

645
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,491
- [indistinct]
- Get back, I'll do it.

646
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,160
- I will! I will!
- [Sara speaking indistinctly]

647
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:54,228
- Stay! Stay! Stay!
- He'll do it!

648
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,240
We must clean up my body.

649
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,618
First, we must remove my human body.

650
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,589
I've got to answer the call of nature.

651
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:27,845
[Gideon groans]

652
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,226
Hey, nice car, mister.

653
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,394
[chuckles]

654
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
[grunts]

655
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,146
[bell rings]

656
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,274
You know, we might make it in time,

657
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,443
get to the city
with time for a bite to eat.

658
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,238
- Ah, thanks to our lucky rock.
- [chuckles]

659
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,731
- Oh. I must have left it inside the car.
- [bell rings]

660
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,453
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- [engine starts]

661
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,330
[both] Hey!

662
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,667
- Get him.
- No! No! No!

663
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,258
Godspeed, ladies.
Still got time to beat my record.

664
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:06,758
[bell rings]

665
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:11,264
Great, we lost our ride, our lucky rock,

666
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,057
and now, Gideon.

667
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,229
Unless you can swim faster
than a blue marlin,

668
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,357
we're gonna lose
the rest of our friends, too.

669
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,778
[machinery beeping]

670
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,241
[sighs] Ooh. There are a lot more of you
than I thought there would be.

671
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,743
This is only half the crew.
Wait till you meet the rest.

672
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,665
Hey, everybody! I'd like to
introduce you to Dr. Gwyn Davies.

673
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,042
Nice to make your acquaintance.

674
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,711
Ah, there she is.

675
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,005
Ah, yes.

676
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:48,426
My divine mission
is finally coming to fruitions.

677
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:49,969
Hey, man, I'm Behrad.

678
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,262
- [clears throat]
- Sorry.

679
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:52,865
I just feel like I know you.

680
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,891
I mean, I've been studying
your life's work,

681
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,560
and chilling in your apartment,
and using your glassware.

682
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,688
I borrowed a glass, by the way.
Hope that's cool.

683
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,316
Uh, hey, is that...

684
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,401
- Oh, yeah.
- [mouths]

685
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,820
Also, uh, Edison's dead.

686
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,490
- What?
- So, there's another Hoover-Bot,

687
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,325
and now Edison-Bot deployed,

688
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,328
but headline,
there's a rogue <i>Waverider</i> after us.

689
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,456
But we did get the plans.

690
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,750
Oh, my files. Thank you so much.

691
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,960
You know, you really do look familiar.

692
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,421
Oh, maybe I just have
one of those faces.

693
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,174
Ray, he looks like Ray.

694
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,134
- My Ray?
- I said a young Stein, but whatever.

695
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,970
We got the plans, we got the doc. B!

696
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,597
[Dr. Davies clears throat]

697
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,600
You got to assemble last part
to get the timeline back on track.

698
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,812
Yes, the final piece of the puzzle.

699
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,108
You ready?

700
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,112
[exhales] Come on, come on.

701
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,990
[machine starts]

702
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,331
- Ava.
- What?

703
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,833
- Oh!
- What happened? Did I disappear?

704
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,378
It worked.

705
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,713
I am so sorry.
I never should have rushed.

706
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,173
I should have listened to you.

707
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,800
No, no, no, it's okay.

708
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,723
What matters
is that we're back together again.

709
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,888
Oh, oh, oh, oh. No, no. No.

710
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,348
This is not a group hug situation?

711
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,934
Right, well, it should be
a bit of a squeeze,

712
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,353
but I'm sure we all can fit.

713
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,356
[sighs] All right.
What do you say, guys?

714
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:26,899
Ready to go home?

715
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:32,697
Here, do another luck spell.
Maybe we can still make it.

716
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,115
I can't.

717
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,324
The spell was fake.

718
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:37,827
Come again?

719
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,162
There is no luck spell. I made it up.

720
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,890
I pretended to do it
to make you feel better

721
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,034
and give you back some hope.

722
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,309
You were at a pretty low point.

723
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,533
Okay, then, how do you explain
where the luck came from?

724
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,754
It came from... us.

725
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,339
Hey, no, think about it.

726
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,758
You felt better
after I did the spell, right?

727
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,052
Gideon convinced Erwin
to give us a ride.

728
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,263
I sweet-talked the cop
into letting us go.

729
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,598
We made our own luck.

730
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,851
And we can keep making it,
but we have to do it fast

731
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,186
because we only have five minutes
to stop them.

732
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,524
Or do we stop everything?

733
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,484
- Let's go.
- [mumbles]

734
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,028
[intense music playing]

735
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,290
- Oh, hello?
- [screams]

736
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,794
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm Gideon.

737
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,881
[scoffs] Well, Gideon,
you got to the count of three

738
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,804
to get out of my new car
or I'm gonna make you.

739
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,177
One, two...

740
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:37,427
[thuds]

741
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,767
By my calculations, there's still
enough time to save my friends.

742
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,144
With luck.

743
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,021
[engine revs]

744
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,692
Right then, where to?

745
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,129
We need to go somewhere
we can get back to our time machine

746
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,353
and find the rest of our crew.

747
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,031
Tahiti, 2021.

748
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,508
There's a Time Bureau safe house there.

749
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,493
We can go pick up some Time Couriers.

750
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:04,246
And sounds like a great honeymoon, hmm?

751
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,540
Tahiti would be an amazing honeymoon.

752
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,104
I'm so sorry to interrupt you ladies,

753
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:11,337
[clears throat] but after you have got
the rest of your friends,

754
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,589
you will hold up your end of the deal,
won't you?

755
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,596
- I always keep my word.
- [Agent Sharpe] Deal?

756
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,926
What do you... What?

757
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,678
You know what? Nope. I don't even care.

758
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,722
It's been a crazy day. I disappeared.
I don't want to know anything.

759
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:23,557
Don't tell me anything.

760
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,184
Um, you should know one thing.

761
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,020
Um, we also killed Edison.

762
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,230
You what?

763
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,405
Come on, lucky rock.

764
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,430
[Spooner] If you do a lightning spell
to zap this tower,

765
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,789
with as much juice as you can,

766
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,834
it should overwhelm the grid and cause
a citywide blackout, therefore...

767
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,586
Preventing the Legends
from ever turning on that time machine.

768
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,547
I am the master of my fate.

769
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,924
I am the captain of my soul.

770
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,510
[machine starts]

771
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,886

- [rumbling]
- [Astra grunting]

[electricity buzzing]

[grunting]

777
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,710
Let's do this.

778
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,646
No!

779
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,031
Astra, I got ya!

780
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,950
[breathing heavily]

781
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,425
[Spooner] Hurry up, move it,
we're almost there!

782
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:22,843
Go, go, go!

783
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,221
Did we make it?

784
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,766
...and that's how I arrived here.

785
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,144
Oh! Hello, Astra. Hello, Spooner.

786
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:33,978
[all cheering]

787
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,154
Aw!

788
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,532
[all exclaiming]

789
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,452
How many
bloody time travelers are there?

790
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:49,995
[indistinct chatter]

791
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,498
Then Astra did a lightning spell.

792
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:53,791
Yeah, here we are.

793
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,168
Well, how'd you know
the blackout was gonna work?

794
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,590
I guess we got lucky.

795
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,008
[indistinct chatter]

796
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,929
Thought you could use a drink.
Heard you had quite the journey.

797
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,848
Thank you. Mmm.

798
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:10,266
Save some for me.

799
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,976
Just kidding, I don't drink.

800
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,270
We also have an infinite amount.

801
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:16,814
[chuckles]

802
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,279
I had my foot on the gas that whole time
and we almost blew up.

803
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,073
And now because we didn't,
the timeline might be off.

804
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,160
Oh, my God.
Hey, what if you fritz out again?

805
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,745
Babe, it's okay. I'm here now.

806
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,250
Seeing you vanish like that, it was...

807
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,962
It's like I saw my entire future
just disappear.

808
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,840
Our whole lives together,
and it's just gone.

809
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:47,177
And it wasn't the time travel
or the hijinks.

810
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,223
It was like I lost my safe place.

811
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,269
And I lost the cuddles on the couch

812
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:59,273
and bourbon sunsets on our porch.

813
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,067
- You know we don't have a porch.
- It's okay.

814
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,696
I love bourbon sunsets
on our non-existent porch.

815
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,240
- I love you.
- Love you.

816
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,872
- Hey, power's back on.
- [sighs]

817
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:18,208
So, Gideon, what was gonna cause
the machine to explode?

818
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,920
The machine requires
a class CR-055 superconductor

819
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,212
that doesn't need recharging.

820
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:25,215
It can power the machine safely
unlike alternating current.

821
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,385
Unfortunately, it won't be invented
for another 300 years.

822
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,679
Three hundred years?

823
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,766
Well, guys, looks like we're stuck
in 1925 forever.

824
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,142
Oh.

825
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,520
I was supposed to die today,
but by God's will, I didn't.

826
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,189
There has to be another way.

827
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,944
Did... Did you say, CR-055?

828
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,667
A little blue chip
the size of an eyeball?

829
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,989
Precisely. How did you know?

830
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,118
That chip was in Hoover-Bot's head.

831
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,162
[mumbling]

832
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:56,622
Ah.

833
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,791
Bahoom.

834
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,293
- [grunts]
- Do you have enough room?

835
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,338
Plenty. I'm used to really tight spaces.

836
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,048
Me, too.

837
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:07,508
[machine whirring]

838
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,592
[thuds]

839
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,304
The other <i>Waverider,</i> it's here.

840
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,474
- All right, punch it.
- Okay.

841
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,143
Tahiti 2021, here we come.

842
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,437
[crackling]

843
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,897
[upbeat music playing]

844
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,843
[Sara] Uh, guys...

845
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,762
I don't think this is Tahiti.

846
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,856
