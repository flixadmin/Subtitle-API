1
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,576
You can come on out.

2
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,425
It's an actual store.

3
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:55,139
I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner repair"
was a term of art.

4
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,564
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

5
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,650
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

6
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,455
That good?

7
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,249
- Sure.
- What about this?

8
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,043
I'll Photoshop that out.

9
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,762
Oh, Nebraska. What's in Nebraska?

10
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,807
You. From now on.

11
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,686
It's gonna take me some time
to get your new situation fixed.

12
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,149
Until then, you're gonna be staying here.
I got a place downstairs, out of sight.

13
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:50,570
It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's
comfortable enough for short-term.

14
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,030
How short-term?

15
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:56,117
Considering you got your face up
on buses and billboards all over town

16
00:01:56,326 --> 00:02:00,580
I'm thinking two days.

17
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,498
Maybe three.

18
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,627
Only thing is,

19
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,712
and I don't like to do this,

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,341
but you'll have a bunk mate.

21
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,552
Oh, yeah? He's still here?

22
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,179
For the moment.

23
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,974
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

24
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,354
How's he holding up?

25
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,816
You be the judge.

26
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,230
We will find Hank.

27
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,399
Steve too.

28
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,235
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

29
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,487
You have my word.

30
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,284
Sir.

31
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,002
Call it in, get her out of here. Move.

32
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,809
<i>I get to his door,</i>

33
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,353
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

34
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,897
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

35
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,651
<i>And I thought, you know, maybe...</i>

36
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,572
{\an8}<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

37
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,075
{\an8}<i>The music stopped,
and then he was right there.</i>

38
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:04,996
{\an8}<i>When he saw the gun, he thought...</i>

39
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,581
{\an8}Hey, Kenny.

40
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,293
{\an8}Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

41
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,213
{\an8}Just watch.

42
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,925
{\an8}<i>He kept saying that, you know,
"You don't have to do this."</i>

43
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,303
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

44
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:25,683
{\an8}- <i>They high-fived because it worked.</i>
- Such a bitch. He won't quit.

45
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,977
{\an8}<i>Then, you know, we turn around,</i>

46
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:33,274
{\an8}<i>and there is this kid on a dirt bike</i>

47
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,234
{\an8}<i>looking at us.</i>

48
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,779
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

49
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,865
<i>That kid that went missing
up in White Horse.</i>

50
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,575
{\an8}<i>It's him.</i>

51
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,370
{\an8}<i>And then out of nowhere</i>

52
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,583
{\an8}<i>Todd, that Opie, dead-eyed piece of shit</i>

53
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:55,004
{\an8}<i>pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.</i>

54
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,507
{\an8}<i>This is Todd Alquist we're talking about?</i>

55
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,509
{\an8}<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

56
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,805
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

57
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,609
{\an8}Hey, Uncle Jack. Hold up.

58
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,698
{\an8}We should keep him for a while,
get a couple of cooks under our belt.

59
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,607
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

60
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:29,443
- He ratted you out, personally.
- We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.

61
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,625
Meth? Who gives a shit about meth?
We won the lottery here.

62
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:37,588
{\an8}We've got all the money in the world.
You're talking to me about selling crank?

63
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,757
I mean, this is millions, Uncle Jack.

64
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,219
No matter how much you got,
how do you turn your back on more?

65
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,185
You little

66
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,563
son of a bitch.

67
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,861
{\an8}It's that Lydia woman.

68
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,947
{\an8}You're sweet on her, you little bastard.

69
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,869
- Hey, Kenny, you believe this?
- Hey, it's all about this right here, huh?

70
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,582
{\an8}Come on.

71
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,292
{\an8}You can do better.

72
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,117
That one's so uptight, probably
got a wood chipper for a coochie.

73
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,966
{\an8}Stick it in down there,
you're pulling back a stump.

74
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,386
Oh, what the hell?

75
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:29,098
{\an8}Heart wants what the heart wants, right?

76
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:36,063
{\an8}Let's go back and watch some more
of that crybaby rat, huh?

77
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,038
{\an8}How thick is it?

78
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,376
{\an8}This is mild steel?

79
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,631
No, this would be cash.

80
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,814
What?

81
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,774
Nothing.

82
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,776
Hey, you know what?

83
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,446
Make yourself useful.

84
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,699
{\an8}Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries.

85
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,660
{\an8}Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got "concerns."

86
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,122
{\an8}Don't worry. We'll take the time
to vet them.

87
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,542
{\an8}Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

88
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,964
{\an8}Five should do it, providing they're
the right men for the job.

89
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:31,262
{\an8}I'm gonna hate myself for asking,
but who are we hitting?

90
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,474
Jack Welker and his men.

91
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,438
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

92
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,107
{\an8}I don't know any hit men.

93
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,693
{\an8}You know a guy who knows a guy.

94
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,988
{\an8}Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

95
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,991
{\an8}I'm paying top dollar. We'll find them.

96
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,662
{\an8}You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

97
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,956
Just for old time's sake?

98
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:01,500
{\an8}You're worried about your wife and kids?

99
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,918
{\an8}Don't leave.

100
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:06,130
{\an8}The way things are now,
some people... Not me, mind you,

101
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,338
{\an8}but some people might say
you're leaving her high and dry.

102
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:13,429
{\an8}Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

103
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,767
{\an8}Some people wouldn't know
that as far as the police are concerned

104
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,978
{\an8}Skyler is a blameless victim.

105
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,149
No, no, no. Go ahead.

106
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,359
{\an8}Get it off your chest.

107
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,278
{\an8}Go on.

108
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,031
The phone call was a smart move.
Kudos to you.

109
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,076
Odds are it was recorded.
It'll play great for a jury.

110
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,119
It might even buy her a mistrial.

111
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,582
In a year and a half. Until then,
if they don't have you, they go after her.

112
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:46,545
- There's no point. She knows nothing.
- Well, too bad. She's got nothing to trade.

113
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,204
I hate to be a downer here,

114
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,217
but there are two DEA agents missing,
presumed dead.

115
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,804
Think the feds will let that go
because you hit the ejector seat?

116
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:59,266
First thing they're gonna do, they will
RICO your wife and kids out of the house.

117
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,102
That condo is gone.

118
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,145
Your bank accounts, they're frozen.

119
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:07,358
Her picture's probably on TV right now,
next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?

120
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,820
- Money's no problem.
- Well, I don't mean to contradict you,

121
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,155
but getting it to her, impossible.

122
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,741
The feds are praying
that you'll make contact.

123
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,244
The Internet, the phone, it's all tapped.

124
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,663
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

125
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,542
But every time he tried to get
his nest egg to his granddaughter

126
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,877
it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.

127
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,714
So you propose what?

128
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,844
Stay. Face the music.

129
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,516
I mean, how much time have you got left?
You walk in with your head held high

130
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,895
be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan
Detention Center. How bad is that?

131
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,273
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money.

132
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,525
Maybe that soothes some troubled waters.

133
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,403
Maybe they let your family stay
in the house.

134
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,781
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

135
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,908
God, you think I want to run?

136
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:00,661
This is the last thing that I want.

137
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,788
This... This changes nothing.

138
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:06,584
What I do, I do for my family.

139
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,878
My money goes to my children.

140
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,172
Not just this barrel. All of it!

141
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,886
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

142
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,598
and I'm gonna take back what is mine
and give it to my children.

143
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,392
And then, and only then

144
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,811
am I through.

145
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,022
Do you understand?

146
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:31,942
Everything good?

147
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,737
Define "good."

148
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,656
You're set. Time to go.

149
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,159
You'll be a little longer.

150
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,369
I'm still working on transportation.

151
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,913
Change of plans.

152
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,206
He's coming with me.

153
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:50,044
- No. No, that's not...
- We're going together. I can use him.

154
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,506
I'll give you two a minute.

155
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:58,302
Hey, I'm a civilian.
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

156
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,265
I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun's over.
From here on out, I'm Mr. Low-Profile.

157
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,974
A douche bag with a job
and three pairs of Dockers.

158
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,771
If I'm lucky, month from now,
best-case scenario

159
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,940
- I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.
- You're still part of this

160
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,486
- whether you like it or not.
- Sorry. I don't think so.

161
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,911
You remember what I told you?

162
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:30,084
It's not over until...

163
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,479
It's over.

164
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,505
Do you want us to cuff her now?
Would that make you feel better?

165
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,550
Your client admits to...

166
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:27,640
Her day of reckoning is now.

167
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,771
...by the time this goes to trial.

168
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,816
Is she even listening?

169
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,570
Mrs. White?

170
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,655
Are you following all this?

171
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,950
Do you understand what's happening here?

172
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,245
Yes.

173
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,206
I understand.

174
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,128
I understand I'm in terrible trouble.

175
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:01,133
I understand that you will use
everything in your power

176
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,845
against me and my children unless...

177
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,181
Unless I give you Walt.

178
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,726
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

179
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,563
I don't know where he is.

180
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,157
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

181
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,035
Rack your brain.

182
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,289
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

183
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,887
<i>Four-seventeen?</i>

184
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,808
Four-seventeen. No activity.

185
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,440
Ma'am, is there anybody else
in the house?

186
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,235
What about your son?

187
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,655
If I go look in his room,
am I gonna see him?

188
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,367
He's not gonna pop out and surprise me?

189
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,913
If this guy takes his hand away,
are you gonna scream?

190
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,461
He's at his friend's house.

191
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,463
He's been there all week.

192
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,466
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.

193
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,469
- Please... Please.
- Ma'am.

194
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,098
We got a lot of respect for your husband.

195
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,435
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

196
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,980
Okay, we know that you've
been talking to the police,

197
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,983
and that's okay. You gotta do that.

198
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,986
But you've seen some people.

199
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,156
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

200
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,577
The one with the black hair.

201
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,122
You said anything about her?

202
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

203
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,377
You sure about that?

204
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,006
I didn't.

205
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,302
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

206
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,810
Okay, ma'am,
I'm gonna need you to say it.

207
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,773
I will not

208
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:07,235
say anything about her. Ever.

209
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,696
I swear.

210
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,954
Okay.

211
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:24,795
When we leave, you're not gonna go running
to those police officers out front?

212
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,839
No.

213
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,429
Okay.

214
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,099
Okay.

215
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,979
Because you really
don't want us coming back.

216
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,516
Sure.

217
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,031
Don't. Stay where you are.

218
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,033
We'll talk like this.

219
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,371
Okay.

220
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,793
So that thing that we talked about

221
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:52,424
- I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house...
- You don't have to say the name.

222
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,344
Sure. And it went really good.

223
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,640
I mean, the message was received
loud and clear.

224
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:05,228
The message? Yeah.

225
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,064
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think...

226
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,066
Hi. What can I get you?

227
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,569
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.

228
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,238
- And I'll need more stevia.
- Sure.

229
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,497
The person we're discussing saw my face.

230
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,040
You're not Western Union.

231
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,210
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

232
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,548
Really, if you'd been there,
I think you'd see it different.

233
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,550
We threw a real scare into her.

234
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,846
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

235
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,308
So you're not going to have
a problem with her.

236
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,853
- I can pretty much guarantee it.
- I wish I had your certainty,

237
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:52,484
but I'm not like you and your uncle. I'm
just... I'm not used to this kind of risk.

238
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,986
We're gonna have to take a break.

239
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,034
I have 50 pounds vacuum-packed
and ready to go.

240
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,538
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

241
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,249
It's 92 percent.

242
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,503
I'm sorry?

243
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,298
Ninety-two percent.

244
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,719
- Truly?
- Tested it twice.

245
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,348
And it's blue, just like before.

246
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:28,436
Ninety-two. That's Heisenberg level.

247
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,898
He's not with you?

248
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,943
Well, next best thing. Pinkman.

249
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,071
They're looking for Pinkman.

250
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,617
Well, they're not going to find him. He's
with us and he's not going anywhere.

251
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:52,544
Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys
in Europe have been begging for, right?

252
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,929
I just think we work together good.

253
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,391
We make a good team.

254
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,271
I think it's kind of

255
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,732
mutually good.

256
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,903
Ninety-two percent.

257
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,067
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

258
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,669
All right.

259
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,339
Let's have a look at this place.

260
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,092
You got about a month's worth
of food on hand.

261
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,221
Most of it's canned goods,
but there's steaks in the freezer.

262
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,017
You got a generator outside, works on LP.

263
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,811
Ought to be enough in the tank
to last the winter.

264
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,484
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do
for the lights, the TV, and the freezer.

265
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,902
That's a wood-burner.

266
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,363
Ought to warm the place up pretty good.

267
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,865
Plus you can cook on it.

268
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,786
On the TV front,
the reception's pretty much nil.

269
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,538
You got some mountains in the way.

270
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,583
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

271
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,336
but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.

272
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,048
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

273
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,842
Two copies.

274
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,845
I'm not much of a movie guy.

275
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,392
I'll make a supply run next month.

276
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,937
You want something else to watch,
put it on the list.

277
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,314
Supply run.

278
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,317
Fifty thousand dollars
for a trip to Costco.

279
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,860
It's risk.

280
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,906
And risk is what you're paying me for,
not toilet paper.

281
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,785
Risk and a 4400-mile round trip.

282
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,287
Mr. Lambert

283
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,500
my clients and I don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

284
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,003
Normally you and I would have already
gone our separate ways,

285
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:44,715
but you're you.

286
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,512
- Where's the phone?
- No phone.

287
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:57,310
Up here, ice storms equal service calls,
equal you in cuffs.

288
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,855
- Internet?
- Same deal.

289
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:04,526
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

290
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,071
You want news,
I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,992
- Whatever you need, just put it on the list.
- Put it on the list. Yeah.

292
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,745
Look, I have business to conduct.

293
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:20,167
Your business is your business.

294
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,211
My business is keeping you
out of custody.

295
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,339
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

296
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,550
Your face is all over TV.

297
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,346
You are the hottest client
I have ever had, by far.

298
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:38,560
It stands to reason
you've got to keep out of sight.

299
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,939
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

300
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,649
Nothing.

301
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,737
There's a little one-horse town
eight miles down the hill.

302
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,156
There's not a thing on God's green earth

303
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,784
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

304
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
All I'm saying is

305
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,165
if you leave this place,
you will get caught.

306
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,418
And I gotta tell you

307
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,296
if I find out that
you've left the reservation

308
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,716
I won't be coming back.

309
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,637
That is for my own safety.
You understand?

310
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,641
Sure.

311
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,519
Know how to work the stove?

312
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,522
- The flue can be tricky.
- Yeah, I got it.

313
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,445
You paid good money for this.

314
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,199
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

315
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:40,329
Seems to me just the spot
for a man to rest up and think on things.

316
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,877
If you look around,
it's kind of beautiful.

317
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,548
You've been very helpful. Thank you.

318
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,508
See you in a month.

319
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,231
Tomorrow.

320
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,487
Tomorrow.

321
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,620
Come...

322
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,542
Oh, so you're just too good
to eat with the rest of us, huh?

323
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,379
- It's not for me.
- Damn, man, seriously.

324
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,132
That's not my chocolate chip, is it?

325
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,426
You're gonna spoil him.

326
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,932
Hey, you awake?

327
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,852
Yeah.

328
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,855
We had some Ben & Jerry's.

329
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:57,444
There's peanut butter cup
and AmeriCone Dream.

330
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,572
I didn't know what you liked,
so I got you some of each.

331
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,036
There you go.

332
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,093
So that batch that you just cooked
was 96 percent.

333
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,722
Kind of figured you deserved
a little something.

334
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,975
Thanks.

335
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,202
Well, better get some sleep.

336
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,370
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

337
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,956
Got a whole new batch.

338
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,710
- Hey, Todd.
- Yeah?

339
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,839
Would you mind
leaving the tarp off tonight?

340
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,092
Well, might get cold.

341
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,636
No, I don't mind. I just...

342
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,138
I just wanna see the stars.

343
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,311
Sure. Okay.

344
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,021
Thanks.

345
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,609
Well, good night, Jesse.

346
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,237
Night.

347
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,797
Okay. Okay. Okay.

348
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,632
Okay.

349
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,458
Come on, bitch.

350
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,135
Go ahead! Do it!

351
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,890
Just kill me now and get it over with,
because there's no way

352
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,185
I'm doing one more cook
for you psycho fucks!

353
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,624
- Yes?
- Hi, ma'am. How you doing tonight?

354
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,334
You're Andrea, right?

355
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,586
How can I help you?

356
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,631
You know Jesse Pinkman?

357
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,010
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his.
My name's Todd.

358
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:37,932
I'm sorry to bother you so late,
but it's nice to meet you.

359
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,314
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

360
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,857
Yeah, he's okay.

361
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,151
Actually, I brought him with me.

362
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,610
Jesse's here?

363
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,073
Yeah, he's right over there
in that truck.

364
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,128
Where?

365
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,673
No!

366
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,097
Just so you know, this isn't personal.

367
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,183
No!

368
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,248
Whoa, hey, settle down.

369
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,751
Settle down.

370
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,545
Hey, remember.

371
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,756
There's still the kid.

372
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,158
I brought you a couple of cases of
Ensure. Maybe put a little weight on you.

373
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,534
Jesus.

374
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,079
I can barely read this.

375
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,497
Almost forgot.

376
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,417
Without a prescription, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun it.

377
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,128
One of these ought to come close.

378
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,384
Did you check on them?

379
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,219
Is Skyler in a better place?

380
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,639
No, she's still at that place
off of Eubank.

381
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,183
Kids are both still with her
for the moment.

382
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,811
There's no court date yet.

383
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,524
The news was talking about a grand jury,
but they didn't say when.

384
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,111
I saw her public defender on TV.

385
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,571
Looks like a deer in the headlights.

386
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,408
Think I got socks older than him.

387
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,704
What are they doing for money?

388
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,956
She's doing taxi dispatch, part-time.

389
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,668
Leaves the baby with a neighbor
when she goes in.

390
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,879
I saw her shopping one time.

391
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,464
She looks pretty good.

392
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,092
And she's using her maiden name.

393
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,846
I wouldn't take that personally,
under the circumstances.

394
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,140
Those working for you?

395
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,058
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,978
I took a run by your old house.

397
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,481
The auction's still pending.
They put a fence up around it.

398
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,774
They put up a fence?

399
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,070
Seems like the place got to be kind of
a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in.

400
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,408
The neighbors complained,
so the bank put up a fence.

401
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,789
You ready?

402
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,212
Yeah.

403
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,427
Sorry about last time.

404
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:48,391
It should go better now.
I watched a couple of YouTube videos.

405
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,519
It's all about finding the vein.

406
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,440
Give it to me. I'll do it.

407
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,665
Here, you do it.

408
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,171
Make a fist. Tight. There we go.

409
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,299
All right, it's just...

410
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,802
Stick.

411
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,054
That's it. Okay. Hey.

412
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,640
Pretty good. There you go.

413
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,437
Think I had worse my last physical.

414
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,068
I will see you on...

415
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,319
Let's see.

416
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,073
Afternoon of the 15th.

417
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,452
Stay a little longer?

418
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,332
Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.

419
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,585
Two hours?

420
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:02,090
I'll give you another $10,000.

421
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,806
Please.

422
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,061
Ten thousand.

423
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,023
One hour.

424
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,612
Cards?

425
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,662
All right, well...

426
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,790
The game will be seven-card.

427
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:44,424
I'll deal, since you are encumbered.

428
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,018
One of these days, when you come up here

429
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,896
I'll be dead.

430
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,067
My money over there.

431
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,071
What happens to it then?

432
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:13,244
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

433
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,544
Would you do it?

434
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,635
If I said yes

435
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,388
would you believe me?

436
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,567
You wanna cut the cards?

437
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,863
No.

438
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,664
A king.

439
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,415
Two kings.

440
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,498
<i>Flynn White to the principal's
office, please.</i>

441
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,676
I'm sorry to pull you out of class.

442
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,219
It's your aunt Marie.

443
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,096
It sounds very important.

444
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,850
- You can take it in here, okay?
- Okay.

445
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,685
Here he is.

446
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,104
Thank you.

447
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,023
Hey, Aunt Marie.

448
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,859
What's...? What's going on?

449
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,027
Hold on a sec, honey.

450
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,613
<i>Look at those numbers for Denver.</i>

451
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,075
<i>Things haven't gone their way...</i>

452
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,953
Son, it's me. Please, don't let on.

453
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,081
<i>Carmen's nearby, right?
She cannot know.</i>

454
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,668
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

455
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,170
Yes.

456
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,007
It's so good to hear your voice.

457
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,803
I...

458
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,638
I...

459
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:49,353
Son, the things that they're saying

460
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,606
<i>about me...</i>

461
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,068
<i>I did wrong.
I made some terrible mistakes.</i>

462
00:44:56,277 --> 00:45:00,531
But the reasons were always...

463
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:10,333
Things happened that I never intended.

464
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,336
I never intended...

465
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,802
Listen, son, we don't have much time.

466
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,474
Is Louis' family still at 4848 Newcombe?

467
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,061
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett</i>

468
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,232
<i>does his family still live
in that same place up on Newcombe?</i>

469
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,150
- Yes.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

470
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,613
Okay, he's a good kid.
He's like you. He'll understand.

471
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,574
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

472
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,745
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you</i>

473
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,623
<i>your mother and your sister.</i>

474
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,086
There's money inside.

475
00:45:55,294 --> 00:46:00,800
About $100,000. Okay?

476
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,677
I think.

477
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,054
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>

478
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,765
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

479
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:11,435
If anyone says a word,
the police will take it.

480
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,865
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>

481
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,493
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

482
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,787
Do you understand?

483
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,835
Son?

484
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,714
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

485
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,636
You want to send money?

486
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,638
Yes. Good.

487
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,807
Good, good.

488
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,436
So you'll talk to Louis, right?

489
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,980
You killed Uncle Hank.

490
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,275
- You killed him!
- Listen. Wait. Wait, son.

491
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,820
- No. What you did to Mom... You asshole.
- <i>Please...</i>

492
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,322
You killed Uncle Hank.

493
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,035
- Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.
- Just shut up. Just stop it. Stop it.

494
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,287
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

495
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,372
I don't give a shit.

496
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,916
- You need this money.
- <i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>

497
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,085
<i>- You killed him!</i>
- Your mother needs this money.

498
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,519
- It can't all be for nothing.
- <i>What you did...</i>

499
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,049
- Please. Please.
- <i>Just shut up. Shut up.</i>

500
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,384
<i>Will you just...? Just leave us alone.</i>

501
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,595
You asshole!

502
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,389
Why are you still alive?

503
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,392
<i>- Why won't you just die already?</i>
- Please...

504
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,769
Just... Just die.

505
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,399
<i>Wagner hasn't had to be
really stellar tonight.</i>

506
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,402
<i>Made solid saves
back in the first period.</i>

507
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,703
<i>You know, Michael, that's probably...
Going back, look at Wagner's numbers</i>

508
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:56,582
<i>you know, it seems like he's one of
the last goalies in the league.</i>

509
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,293
<i>They don't wanna
put pressure on this guy.</i>

510
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,338
<i>Kevin Granato looks to make a move,
had the puck taken.</i>

511
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,382
<i>Denver comes back out the other way.</i>

512
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,971
<i>- -by Graham Melanson off Rycroft.
- Who else?</i>

513
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,143
<i>Boy, he's been all over the ice tonight.</i>

514
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,688
<i>DEA, Albuquerque District Office.</i>

515
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,564
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

516
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:25,277
I'd like to speak to the agent

517
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,948
in charge of the Walter White
investigation.

518
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,867
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>

519
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,620
Walter White.

520
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,000
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

521
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:44,672
<i>Sir? Sir, are you still there?</i>

522
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,924
<i>...this is not just a goalie that's
out there, it's a whole team.</i>

523
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,469
<i>Two forty-nine remaining
in the third period.</i>

524
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,888
You ready for that drink now?

525
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,644
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

526
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,521
You got it.

527
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,190
<i>...and Melanson
with a good look makes the save.</i>

528
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>That's why you need good, solid
breakout passes.</i>

529
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,237
<i>Matt Peterson... Win the draw, Englehart
wins the draw, back to Peterson</i>

530
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:13,171
<i>goes behind the net, makes a terrible
breakout pass, goes right to Hackard.</i>

531
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,412
<i>He just winds up, puts it on net here.
Turnovers, turnovers.</i>

532
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,874
<i>When you get turnovers
in the offensive zone, chances happen.</i>

533
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,792
<i>Hopefully it won't happen again.</i>

534
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,086
<i>Turnovers generally...</i>

535
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,340
<i>- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- I'm not staying...</i>

536
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,803
<i>- Madam, is this transfer good on the...?
- Darker than a normal rosé...</i>

537
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,848
<i>For us, it's always been
science first, and...</i>

538
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,100
Wait, would you...? Would you...?

539
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,853
Would you go back, please?

540
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,861
<i>- ShamWows...
- More of a by-product.</i>

541
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,064
- There.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

542
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,692
- What, this?
- Yes.

543
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,819
<i>But just yesterday, your charity</i>

544
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,614
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz
Foundation</i>

545
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,201
<i>announced a $28 million grant,</i>

546
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,371
<i>for drug-abuse treatment centers
throughout the Southwest.</i>

547
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,540
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home,</i>

548
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:05,544
<i>and we couldn't just ignore
what's going on in our own backyard.</i>

549
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:09,632
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motives.</i>

550
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,718
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin of </i>The New York Times

551
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,054
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

552
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:19,558
<i>that the grant was
a kind of publicity maneuver</i>

553
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,187
<i>to shore up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

554
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:28,108
<i>because of your association
with Walter White.</i>

555
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,196
<i>- Well, that's not exactly the way...
- To cleanse yourselves, so to speak</i>

556
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:37,660
<i>of having a methamphetamine kingpin
as cofounder of your company.</i>

557
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,037
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>

558
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,374
<i>I have to believe that
the investing public understands</i>

559
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,794
<i>we're talking about a person
who was there early on,</i>

560
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,088
<i>but who had nothing to do
with the creation of the company,</i>

561
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,591
<i>and still less to do with growing it.</i>

562
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,303
<i>So, what was Walter White's contribution?</i>

563
00:50:56,512 --> 00:51:00,057
<i>You know, to be honest... Honey?</i>

564
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,393
<i>- The company name.
- The company name.</i>

565
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,271
<i>We came up with it
by combining our names.</i>

566
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,814
<i>"Schwartz" means "black."</i>

567
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,276
<i>- Black plus white makes gray.
- Hence Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

568
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,238
<i>Exactly. As far as I can recall,
his contribution begins and ends there.</i>

569
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,283
<i>There are continuing reports
of blue methamphetamine</i>

570
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,078
<i>considered his signature product
throughout the Southwest,</i>

571
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,582
<i>and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

572
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:29,295
<i>So my question is,
is Walter White still out there?</i>

573
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,463
<i>No, he's not.</i>

574
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:35,050
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

575
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,510
<i>I am.</i>

576
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:42,016
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg
that people refer to,</i>

577
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,519
<i>but whatever he became</i>

578
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,606
<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>

579
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:53,027
<i>that we once knew long ago, he's gone.</i>

580
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,738
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

581
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,225
Police! Hands! Show us your hands.
Show us your hands.

582
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,810
What's going on?

583
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,189
Let's see your hands!
