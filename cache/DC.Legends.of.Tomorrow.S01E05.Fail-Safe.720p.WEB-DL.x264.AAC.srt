00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,700
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,375
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,037
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,646
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,981
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to...</i>

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,449
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,985
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,620
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,556
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

13
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,196
You need to learn to embrace
your human side.

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,564
<i>And what if that side of me
is gone?</i>

15
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,433
What if she
doesn't exist anymore?

16
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,368
No, this is a dictatorship.
You get to call all the shots,

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,303
<i>And I get to take
all the shots.</i>

18
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,372
<i>The most powerful evil
the world has ever known</i>

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,808
has just gone red at the height
of the cold war.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,343
Valentina Vostok?

21
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>She's trying to build
a soviet Firestorm.</i>

22
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,247
<i>Your comrade here tells me
you know quite a bit</i>

23
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,515
about this project of mine.

24
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,050
You're hanging us
out to dry, Rip!

25
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>I need backup!</i>

26
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,219
<i>Half the team is gone.</i>

27
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,754
I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

28
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,091
You and Dr. Vostok have much
work to do in the morning.

29
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,827
Incredible.

30
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,829
This is the exact formula

31
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,765
For the thermocore that's needed
to build a new Firestorm.

32
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,967
How did you manage to arrive
at something

33
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,602
That took decades to produce?

34
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,504
But here's what
I don't understand.

35
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,473
The Firestorm matrix
is unstable.

36
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,442
The thermocore reacts
exponentially

37
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,610
To the rate of fission
in the host body.

38
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:23,315
Well, fortunately, Dr. Wells
developed the quantum splicer

39
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:27,553
To address that very problem.

40
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,756
I-I'm so happy to see
that you're taking an interest

41
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,957
In my work.

42
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,258
What can I say, sir?

43
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,394
Nuclear physics is my passion.

44
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,465
"Sir"?

45
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:44,036
The Cisco I know never dwelled
on formality.

46
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,238
What's more,
your hair is different,

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,676
Your wardrobe neat,
your comportment gentlemanly.

48
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,811
Oh, yeah, you like?

49
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,780
I just subscribed to "GQ".

50
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,216
Huh.

51
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,685
A snide attempt at humor...

52
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,653
Almost Cisco-like.

53
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,188
Almost.

54
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,324
What are you implying?

55
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,394
What I am stating
unequivocally, sir...

56
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,630
Is that you are not Cisco,

57
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:16,368
Which means I am not
in S.T.A.R. Labs.

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,270
Furthermore, I will never,

59
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,740
Never give you the formula.

60
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:34,153
Bravo, Professor Stein.

61
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,126
What cocktail of hallucinogens
have you given me, doctor?

62
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,828
Don't worry.

63
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,431
I would never dream of damaging
that beautiful mind of yours.

64
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,500
I simply want to open it.

65
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,704
Finish the formula, and these
little games of ours can stop.

66
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,073
You'll never trick me
into giving up my research.

67
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,409
And since you also
cannot kill me

68
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,879
And destroy any hope of creating
a soviet Firestorm,

69
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,981
I would like a hot shower

70
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,185
And a change of clothes.

71
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,354
And I thought I gave
a good speech.

72
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,659
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

73
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,928
11 years ago,

74
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,464
You bought a nuclear warhead
off me in Norway.

75
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,234
And then you and your
time-traveling friends

76
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,702
Tried to kill me.

77
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,006
Just like me,
you haven't aged a day.

78
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,708
I have a good hairdresser.

79
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,713
In my long life,
I have met some

80
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,749
Of the most skilled
interrogators in history, but...

81
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,751
But since we are
in the soviet union,

82
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,889
Let me tell you a story
about a friend of mine...

83
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,757
Joseph Stalin.

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,461
He became quite skilled
at breaking a man...

85
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:54,266
Carefully aimed strikes
to the bridge of the nose,

86
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,134
Along the shoulder blades,

87
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,304
And right underneath the chin.

88
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,677
Stalin gave me this
as a gift.

89
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,181
So it's
to be torture, then?

90
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,650
Get on with it.

91
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,218
No.

92
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,722
Nothing so prosaic
for you, Professor.

93
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,425
There are infinite ways
to break a man,

94
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,328
And I have
an infinite amount of time.

95
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,466
Firestorm
is my life's work.

96
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,635
I will never allow you
to pervert it

97
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,137
In pursuit
of global conquest.

98
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,913
This is going to be
so much fun.

99
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,994
<i>Jefferson!
Jefferson!</i>

100
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,963
Jax?

101
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,499
What are you doing in here?

102
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,267
Hey, are you all right?

103
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,305
Yeah, I, uh...

104
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,774
I haven't been able to sleep
the past two nights.

105
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,576
<i>I prescribed Mr. Jackson
some mild medication.</i>

106
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,179
Which don't seem to be doing
a damn thing.

107
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,914
What's wrong?

108
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,449
Ah, it's Stein.

109
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,217
They started in on him again.

110
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,019
He's scared to death.
I-I can feel it.

111
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,056
He's trying to be strong, but...
we're gonna get him back.

112
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:25,691
Ray and Rory too.

113
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,893
I'm sure Captain Hunter
has a plan.

114
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,629
It's my fault he got captured.

115
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,564
If... if he wasn't trying
to protect me,

116
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,932
He would have never
gone in there alone.

117
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,836
It's gonna be okay, Jax,
I promise.

118
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,639
You don't know what kind of
place they got him locked up in.

119
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,341
<i>Labor camp number 54...</i>

120
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,143
<i>Formerly known as the Koshmar
or "nightmare" gulag.</i>

121
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,411
<i>Built in the 18th century...</i>

122
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,647
Can we skip past
the Wikipedia crap

123
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,584
And get to the good stuff,
like how to break in?

124
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,887
Perhaps you didn't register
that as a question, Gideon.

125
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,657
<i>I understood, but in
its 200 years of operation,</i>

126
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,392
<i>No one has successfully
escaped from...</i>

127
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,960
No offense, Gideon,

128
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,529
But I never met a building
I couldn't break into.

129
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,831
Well, I hope you're right.

130
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,799
Savage knows
that Stein created Firestorm,

131
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,634
But if he finds out
that he is Firestorm...

132
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,537
Always Savage with you,
isn't it?

133
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,539
My partner's in prison too.

134
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,041
- And Ray.
- Yeah, whatever.

135
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,876
The point is you didn't lift
a finger.

136
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,644
You know damn well
it was never my intention

137
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,280
To get them thrown into a gulag,
but I had no other option.

138
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,649
Besides, I doubt that it's
Mr. Rory's first time in prison

139
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,318
Or second
or, I imagine, tenth.

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,686
All right, arguing is not

141
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,021
Gonna bring the team back
any faster.

142
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,189
And Rip's right.

143
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,558
Criminals usually do feel
more at home in prison,

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,395
And they know it
better than anyone else.

145
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,696
So?

146
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,564
So what if the key
to breaking in

147
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,033
Is asking someone who's been
in and out of soviet prisons

148
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,068
Their whole life?

149
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,870
And who might that be?

150
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,705
Are you familiar
with the Bratva?

151
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,808
Ooh, the Russian mob?

152
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,078
In 1986, they would have ruled
the criminal underground

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,180
Inside every prison.

154
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,687
Your tattoo.

155
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,358
It stands for
<i>"menia ispravit rasstrel",</i>

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,093
if I'm not mistaken.

157
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,997
In English, it translates to,
"execution will reform me".

158
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,466
What brings you
to the <i>banya,</i> little man?

159
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,501
The name's Rip.

160
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,069
I understand
that you're familiar

161
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,571
With the Koshmar gulag.

162
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,106
We need to break
into that prison.

163
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,676
And can you make it fast?
I despise the heat.

164
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,044
A man by the name
of Vandal Savage

165
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,013
Runs a secret operation
out of it...

166
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,549
A prison within a prison,
if you will.

167
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,084
I've heard of this Savage.

168
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,553
He has no respect

169
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,522
For my country's
rich criminal traditions.

170
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,157
So you'll help us?

171
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,726
You men have no tattoos.

172
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,397
And a man who has no life story
cannot be trusted.

173
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,166
Igor!
Andrei!

174
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,143
Don't all volunteer at once.

175
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,082
Igor and Andrei
seem to be a bit preoccupied.

176
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,118
Now, about that gulag...

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,421
No matter.

178
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:13,158
In this life,
a man fights for himself.

179
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,028
Perhaps you'd like this one.

180
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,798
He's all yours.

181
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,951
So you like
having Vandal Savage

182
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,587
Run his evil empire
from your country?

183
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,560
As much as a pig enjoys
being Christmas dinner.

184
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,202
Help us, and we will destroy
his entire operation.

185
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,444
I just took out six men.
You guys couldn't handle one?

186
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,513
You killed my men?

187
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,148
They're not dead yet.

188
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,252
And neither are you,
assuming you help us.

189
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,956
My organization runs
black-market goods into Koshmar.

190
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,326
Three of our, uh,
well, comrades

191
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,094
Are being held there
by Savage.

192
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,164
Koshmar is not a hotel
for petty criminals.

193
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,633
If your friends are there,

194
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,604
They must be insane,
ruthless animals.

195
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,308
Hey. Howdy.

196
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,476
How you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

197
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,512
Just being friendly.

198
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,380
This must be where they keep
the VIPs.

199
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,982
This is prison, jackass.
There are no VIPs.

200
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,985
Some of these guys
have been here for a while.

201
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,987
Hey, maybe this guy can
tell us where Stein is.

202
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
The only thing you should be
worrying about, Pretty,

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
is lasting the night.

204
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,722
Stein needs help.
He's in real trouble.

205
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,198
Newsflash, so are we.

206
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,742
Think they'll
bring us blankets later?

207
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,547
Now, according to Yuri,

208
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,515
This is where his men
have access.

209
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,717
Got it?

210
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,218
This isn't my first
prison break.

211
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,487
- We got it covered.
- So how can we help?

212
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,822
By staying on the ship.

213
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,290
We don't need
any more casualties.

214
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,459
Besides, Mr. Snart and Sara
have got it covered.

215
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,760
Whoa, man.
Why does it feel like

216
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,462
We're on the JV team
all of a sudden?

217
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,064
What you are is one half
of everything Savage needs

218
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,733
To change the face
of the cold war.

219
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,402
And you are the only person
who can kill him.

220
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,803
Yeah, so you can't just...

221
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,271
I am not going to gift-wrap
the two people

222
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,340
In the world that Savage wants
the most.

223
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,776
We should get going.

224
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,711
Oh, Ms. Lance,
could I borrow you for a moment?

225
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,881
I have something that might
help you out with the mission.

226
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,590
So what did you really want
to talk to me about?

227
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:02,093
Gideon, will you please show
Ms. Lance the projection of 2016

228
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,562
Should our rescue mission fail?

229
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,831
<i>I'd be happy to, Captain.</i>

230
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,769
So this is what will happen
to Russia

231
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,504
If we don't get Stein back?

232
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,839
Not Russia.

233
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,875
This is Star City.

234
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,177
The rest of world
doesn't look much better.

235
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,480
That's impossible.

236
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,016
Not if Stein creates a stable
Firestorm for the soviets.

237
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,718
Here in 1986,
they're already perilously close

238
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,286
To creating a prototype.

239
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,288
Listen to me, Sara. Everything...
everything we've tried

240
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,190
To achieve so far
could be lost.

241
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,826
And not only will my family die
150 years from now,

242
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,296
But your family,
your city...

243
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,766
Your entire 21st-century world
will suffer.

244
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,739
That's why we're gonna
get Stein back

245
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,474
Before Vostok can break him.

246
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:54,312
Well, I-I hope so,
but we need a contingency plan.

247
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,047
What are you saying?

248
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,249
I'm saying that if at any
point throughout the operation

249
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,020
It becomes clear
that Martin is...

250
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,356
Beyond our reach...

251
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,258
You want me to kill Stein?

252
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,839
Impressive how many weapons
you can fit in that outfit...

253
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,578
And how much stupidity Raymond
can squeeze into this one.

254
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,414
The plan is to save him too,
not just Stein and your partner.

255
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,750
Oh, I'm gonna save Raymond,
all right,

256
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,252
So I can beat some sense
into him.

257
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,384
- And what about you?
- What about me?

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,892
Clearly I'm not the only one
with a side mission.

259
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,862
What did Rip keep you
after class to talk about?

260
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,198
He just wanted to go over
a few details of the plan.

261
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,034
He wants you to take out
the old man, doesn't he?

262
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,703
It's the obvious play.

263
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,505
It's also heartless.

264
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,174
The plan is to save Stein.

265
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,444
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't,

266
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,281
Rip showed me what will happen
to my home in 2016,

267
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,983
To our families.

268
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,219
If Stein breaks,
the damage is irreversible.

269
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,689
Been on a lot of heists,
and even when things got rough,

270
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,858
I never took out one
of my own.

271
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,827
Well, this isn't
a bank heist.

272
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,096
First, he left my partner
twisting in the wind.

273
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,032
Now he's gonna have you ice
old silver-top.

274
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,401
We're all just pawns, Sara.

275
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,937
Come on, I'm the crook,
you're the assassin...

276
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,772
He's not just asking me
to kill.

277
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,374
He's asking me to save
the future.

278
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,043
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't save Stein,

279
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:36,147
Then I'm gonna do
what needs to be done.

280
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,285
Huh.
It's just like scout camp.

281
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,053
Man, the food was terrible.

282
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,988
There was one time they gave us
Salisbury steak...

283
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,824
You ever stop talking?

284
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,095
What I wouldn't give for
a little Salisbury steak now.

285
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,770
Hey.
Ray Palmer.

286
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,305
Put your hand down.

287
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,373
He might know where Vostok
is keeping the Professor.

288
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,709
Shut up and eat.

289
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,044
Do you know if there's
any other place

290
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,245
Where they keep prisoners here?

291
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,681
We're looking for a friend.

292
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,249
There is a place.

293
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,384
They send you there,
you never come back.

294
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,187
You can hear the screams
all night.

295
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,791
This place, where is it?

296
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:23,728
Who said you could eat?

297
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,798
Hey, he's not hurting
anybody.

298
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,868
Who is this American
with the pretty teeth?

299
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,570
Must be a comedian, <i>da?</i>

300
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,639
I'm sure we can handle this
like adults.

301
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,351
<i>Sooka!</i>

302
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,096
I brought you something
to eat, Professor.

303
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,532
If this is a bribe,
I politely decline.

304
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,937
So stubborn, so proud...

305
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,272
So American.

306
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,773
You've already built
a thermocore,

307
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,041
So just build another one.

308
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,311
It'll only take you
eight to ten years.

309
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,346
You thought that, what,
your friends stealing

310
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:19,751
The thermocore
would save the West?

311
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,126
As if I would only build one.

312
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,633
We're so close, Professor.

313
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,369
All I need to learn now is how
to stabilize the thermocore,

314
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,406
And my dream of creating
a nuclear man will be achieved.

315
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,440
To what end?

316
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,442
If you launch
a soviet Firestorm,

317
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,778
The United States will have
no choice but to retaliate.

318
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,212
Both countries
will be annihilated.

319
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,282
And out of the ashes,
we will rise stronger...

320
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,551
Just as we did
when the Nazis invaded.

321
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,286
But America is weak...

322
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,657
With your Big Mac,
MTV, movie-star president.

323
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,061
Do you really think
Vandal Savage cares

324
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,829
About the cold war?

325
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,066
He's just using you, doctor.

326
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,469
Do not think of insulting
Mr. Savage in front of me.

327
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,573
Hey, what's wrong?

328
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,841
Something's changed.

329
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,910
Grey thinks
we've abandoned him.

330
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,678
He's starting to lose it
in there.

331
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,913
I can't take this.

332
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,815
We've got to tell Rip.

333
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,917
The guy who benched us?

334
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,952
He'll just tell us
to sit tight.

335
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,188
No, I hate feeling
so helpless.

336
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,057
This is exactly what it was like
when I blew out my knee.

337
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,593
I could barely walk,
recruiters stopped calling,

338
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,462
My mom always crying.

339
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,631
I just wish
there was something I could do.

340
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,866
Wait.

341
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,669
Your connection with Stein,
it goes both ways, right?

342
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,837
Yeah.

343
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,240
So maybe we can send him
a signal.

344
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,544
Grey did tell me about
this one time he and Ronnie...

345
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:57,115
Get a knife.
You need to cut me.

346
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,151
Tell me how
to stabilize Firestorm.

347
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,953
If Einstein had
the opportunity,

348
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,621
He would have traveled back
in time

349
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,024
To prevent the creation
of the atomic bomb.

350
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,226
How can I in good conscience
lead the world

351
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,195
To the invention of something
far more destructive?

352
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,264
You don't really have
a choice.

353
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,534
This toxin, it's not lethal,

354
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,771
But it will make you wish
that it were.

355
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,075
Are you sure about this?

356
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,022
So, Professor...

357
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:45,296
Would you like to talk,
or would you prefer to scream?

358
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,067
Do your worst, doctor.

359
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,259
Hey, Pyro, what was that there
back in the yard?

360
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,495
Just your typical
prison alpha.

361
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,264
He didn't like you
threatening his reputation.

362
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,066
Not that.
I mean you sitting there

363
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,728
While I was getting
my ass kicked.

364
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,236
None of my business.

365
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,000
None of your business?
None of your business?

366
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,707
We're...
supposed to be a team.

367
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,244
The only team I'm on
is mine and Snart's.

368
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,447
Besides, you had
that beatdown coming.

369
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,616
Oh, well, I can't sit back

370
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,751
And watch an old man
get pushed around.

371
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,121
Then you're a bigger fool
than I thought.

372
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,862
These are the ones I want.

373
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,970
Remember me?

374
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,318
Identification papers.

375
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,256
Yuri the bear sent me.

376
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,734
Remember, we get Stein first.

377
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,403
And if the plan fails,
you'll kill him.

378
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,905
- You want my advice?
- No.

379
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,008
Don't use your gun.
Do it with your hands.

380
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,377
Do it while you're looking
right into Stein's eyes.

381
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,709
You're talking
about a member of our team.

382
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,980
I just don't want you
to forget

383
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,116
Who we're talking about.

384
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,257
Thank you.

385
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,860
Valentina has failed
to make you talk.

386
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,728
Now it's my turn.

387
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,738
Colonel, let's begin.

388
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,422
So are you still planning...
what did you threaten before?

389
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,357
To go all "rocky iv" on my ass?

390
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,392
I've changed my mind.

391
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,833
Ivan Drago lives at the end
of the movie.

392
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,802
Ha...

393
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,617
Isn't he supposed to ask us
some questions?

394
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,452
They don't care
what we got to say.

395
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,822
We're just part of the show.

396
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:58,956
Stein.

397
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,726
Professor, we're okay.

398
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,594
Don't tell these bastards
anything!

399
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:12,470
If you think I have a
sentimental attachment to them,

400
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,573
You are as foolish
as you are mad.

401
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,209
You held up longer
than expected.

402
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,416
But if 4,000 years of life
has taught me one thing,

403
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,952
It is patience.

404
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,223
When I get out of here...

405
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,658
That is your mistake...

406
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,726
Thinking that you'll
get out of here.

407
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,628
Hey.

408
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,630
Can I get some water in here?

409
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,099
Something to drink?
I'm a little thirsty.

410
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:46,871
A sandwich would be nice...
a little turkey and mayo.

411
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,873
They have mayo in Russia?

412
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,609
No.

413
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,545
At least in America,
you get a last meal.

414
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,881
This communism really sucks.

415
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,617
What are you doing,
boy scout?

416
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,554
Yes, boy scout,
what are you doing?

417
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,657
Nothing compared to what I did
to your mother last night.

418
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,793
You have quite
a mouth on you.

419
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,728
So does she.

420
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,667
Enough!
You're killing him!

421
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,035
That's it?

422
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,837
Oh, but the colonel will think
that we are cheating him.

423
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,706
I'll tell you
how to stabilize Firestorm.

424
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,642
Just let them live, please!

425
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,913
So how does it feel
to be dead again?

426
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,816
Take the next left.

427
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,784
You can't be
down here, comrade.

428
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:37,355
I was ordered to take
this corpse to the incinerator.

429
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,956
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

430
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,060
Dr. Vostok used him for one
of her smallpox weapons trials.

431
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,431
Highly contagious.

432
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,778
All right, this duct
should take us to solitary.

433
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,841
- We get to Stein...
- Yeah, I'm not going.

434
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,384
- That's the plan.
- That's Rip's plan.

435
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,620
My priority is Mick.

436
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,555
Fine.
Forget it.

437
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,024
So much
for your code, crook.

438
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,128
Anytime, assassin.

439
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,764
Of all the dumb things
I've seen in my life,

440
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,933
You getting that guy
to beat on you takes the cake.

441
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,135
You're welcome.

442
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,338
You think you proved
something back there?

443
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,939
Proved I wasn't scared.

444
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,775
Proved you make
a great piñata.

445
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,077
He could have beaten you
to death.

446
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,946
There are some things that are
more important than survival,

447
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,717
Like standing up
for what you believe in,

448
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,554
Your principles, your team.

449
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,457
There must be something
you're willing to die for.

450
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:50,327
The perfect score.

451
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,730
Well...

452
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:57,034
Only difference between us
is how we define "score".

453
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,572
<i>I'm sorry
to inform you, Captain.</i>

454
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,140
<i>The probability
of the United States</i>

455
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:06,277
<i>Losing the cold war
has risen to 99%.</i>

456
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,379
<i>Star city,
the seat of the resistance,</i>

457
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,548
<i>Is predicted to fall in 2003.</i>

458
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,883
Come on, Sara.

459
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,758
You mentioned

460
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,827
The quantum splicer earlier,
Professor.

461
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,129
Your friends are counting on you
to make the right decision.

462
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,330
I have eyes on Stein.

463
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,798
The future is cementing.

464
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,901
You must extract Stein
before he enters the lab!

465
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,743
Kill her!

466
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,418
<i>What's happening,
Ms. Lance?</i>

467
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,853
I couldn't rescue Stein.

468
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,721
<i>Have they moved him
into the lab?</i>

469
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,623
<i>Yeah, where Savage
has every guard</i>

470
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,625
<i>In the gulag watching him.</i>

471
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,327
Well, if that's the case...

472
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,963
I know what I have to do.

473
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,671
The formula for stabilizing
Firestorm, Professor.

474
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,541
This may surprise you,
but in my youth,

475
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,777
I longed to visit Russia.

476
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,348
I was obsessed
by your culture...

477
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,384
Rachmaninoff,
Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.

478
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,286
Stop stalling.

479
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:26,357
It's a shame I-I never got
to see it before the collapse.

480
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,161
What sort of nonsense
are you talking about?

481
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:36,800
In 1991, your economy fails,
and your empire crumbles.

482
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,270
But the truth is the world
is better off.

483
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,806
In my time, crooks and thieves
rule your country,

484
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,543
Desperate to hang on to power
and the riches

485
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,812
They divide
amongst their cronies.

486
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:52,316
My country
is by no means perfect,

487
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:56,220
But at least we are free
to criticize our government,

488
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:01,191
Vote in fair elections,
and love whom we choose.

489
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:05,629
I, uh, hate to break this
to you, Dr. Vostok.

490
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:09,133
You are on the wrong side
of history.

491
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,736
For now.

492
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:19,944
But you will help us
change history.

493
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,812
Proceed.

494
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,213
Gideon,
are you able to detect

495
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,316
The Professor's
life functions remotely?

496
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,285
<i>Yes, Captain.
His pulse is still strong.</i>

497
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,687
Yeah, not for much longer.

498
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,856
Rip, Jax and I need
to talk to you.

499
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,592
Now is really not
a good time.

500
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,194
Yeah, this will only take
a minute.

501
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,597
I know you think
you can't risk losing us,

502
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,432
But that's assuming
we'd fail.

503
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,534
And we won't.

504
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,603
I'm not afraid anymore.

505
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:46,770
I can do this.

506
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,472
And I don't got
to be Firestorm

507
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,840
to be a part of this team.

508
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:53,442
Look, I am not prepared
to risk anyone else.

509
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,606
- Ever since...
- Carter?

510
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:59,115
- His death wasn't your fault.
- I know.

511
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,418
But Stein's will be.

512
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,949
All I got to do
is touch him,

513
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,721
and we can fly
out of there.

514
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,255
Yeah, once you've scaled
a 50-foot fence

515
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,124
topped with razor wire,
gotten past eight sharpshooters,

516
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,226
and entered a gulag full
of the most dangerous criminals

517
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,561
in the U.S.S.R.

518
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,631
Okay, so you create
a distraction,

519
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:17,134
and I'll fly Jax in,
and no one will see us.

520
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,535
Listen...

521
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:22,873
You're playing chess without
all your pieces on the board.

522
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,809
Maybe you're right.

523
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,711
So that's a "yes"?

524
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
You call that a flame?

525
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,436
Ah.
Nice costume.

526
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:39,338
Got one for you too.

527
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,807
Wakey, wakey.

528
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,169
Time to shrink...
Or not.

529
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,008
- Let's go.
- What about him?

530
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,743
We can't ditch him.
He won't survive.

531
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,448
Two guards walking
out of here... not suspicious.

532
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:52,184
Two guards carrying him out...
suspicious.

533
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
He took a beating for me.

534
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:56,089
Raymond would take a beating
for a total stranger.

535
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,658
Mick, if our time in the can
taught us anything,

536
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,226
it's we look
after each other.

537
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,629
It's you and me, right?

538
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,818
So, if we enter here,
we can cut the circuit breaker.

539
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,353
Shutting off all the power.

540
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,455
Distracting the guards and
giving us time to save our team.

541
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,490
<i>The probability of this plan
being successful...</i>

542
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,192
There is a 15-second window

543
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,827
Where the sharpshooters
on the tower

544
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,429
Aren't covering the breaker.

545
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,231
Which means that somebody
would have to run 120 yards

546
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,800
In less than 12 seconds.

547
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,602
<i>Given Mr. Jackson tore his
anterior cruciate ligament...</i>

548
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,606
Have a little faith,
Gideon.

549
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,408
You can do this.

550
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,511
I know you can.

551
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,013
It's done.

552
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,583
You know, I've never seen
a theorem so simple,

553
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,151
So poetic before.

554
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,488
With this, I can decelerate
the subject's rate of fission

555
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,725
And decrease
core body temperature.

556
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,461
Yet something's missing.

557
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,030
I'm telling you,
that is the equation...

558
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,734
Everything you need to build
a quantum splicer.

559
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,605
"We're coming"?

560
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,240
Explain.

561
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,175
- I cut myself.
- Impossible.

562
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,444
You've been monitored
ever since your arrival here.

563
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,413
So, unless some...

564
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:16,153
So, unless someone else was cut,
yet it appears on your body...

565
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,122
- That's preposterous.
- No, no, no.

566
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,724
You are somehow connected
to the burning man.

567
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,159
That's how you were able
to absorb

568
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,761
The nuclear energy
at Luskavic.

569
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,095
You are mistaken.

570
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,830
No, you didn't only create
Firestorm.

571
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,799
You are one half
of Firestorm.

572
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,667
That's ridiculous!

573
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,569
Bring the core online.

574
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,671
And to think, all this time...

575
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,440
- you were the missing link.
- Listen to me.

576
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,911
It is extremely rare to find
two people who are compatible,

577
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,546
and without the splicer...

578
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,581
Have you ever merged

579
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,417
with a woman before,
Professor?

580
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:52,456
I think you and I are gonna make
a wonderful Firestorm.

581
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,547
What the hell
are they doing?

582
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,716
<i>What I should have done
from the start...</i>

583
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:20,818
Helping rescue Stein.

584
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,252
<i>What about the time line?</i>

585
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,220
I have a plan.

586
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,922
<i>Forget about the fail-safe.</i>

587
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,690
Isn't it a little late
for plan C?

588
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:30,661
<i>Not if Jax can reach
that circuit breaker.</i>

589
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,030
I can't believe you're risking
your life for this idiot.

590
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,035
Okay, okay.

591
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,369
You got this.

592
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:43,507
12 seconds, open field...
done it a million times.

593
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,580
Ah!

594
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,548
Ah!

595
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,522
Barry Allen who?

596
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,495
Electromagnetic locks.

597
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,830
We're dressed as guards.

598
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,765
Run.

599
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,773
Everyone back in your cells!

600
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,382
Enjoy your new cellmate!

601
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,818
No!

602
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,087
That door leads
to the loading bay.

603
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,022
From there, you can get
to the jump ship.

604
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,658
Hey, Mick,
this is a strange kind of hug.

605
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,961
- Where are you going?
- I got something to do.

606
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:52,075
Mr. Savage, I need to get you
to the helicopter.

607
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,412
Make sure the Professor
enters the reactor.

608
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,848
His nuclear-mate is waiting
for him.

609
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,030
Take the core to full power.

610
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,311
There seems to be a riot
going on.

611
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,546
You might want to reconsider
your orders.

612
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,182
Vostok knows Stein
is the other half of Firestorm.

613
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,051
She's trying to merge
with him.

614
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,927
Rip, once Stein is inside
the reactor,

615
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,729
He will become
soviet Firestorm.

616
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,930
Do you copy?

617
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,735
I have the shot.

618
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,208
<i>- Sara, don't do it.
- I don't have a choice.</i>

619
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,910
<i>It's the only way
to save Star City,</i>

620
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,378
The future.

621
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,879
<i>That's how a killer thinks.</i>

622
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,815
And that's not you anymore.

623
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,472
Our energy...

624
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,677
It yearns to be whole,
Professor.

625
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,512
Uh, without the splicer...

626
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,881
Aah!

627
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:40,117
<i>Without the splicer,
you'll never be able to control</i>

628
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,452
<i>Our nuclear reaction.</i>

629
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,488
<i>You have to listen to me,
Dr. Vostok.</i>

630
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,025
<i>Unless we un-fuse,
you'll end up killing us both!</i>

631
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,333
Rip Hunter must be a fool

632
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,935
To send you into my arms.

633
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,605
Come with me, Chay-Ara,

634
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,508
And I will find a way
to prolong your life.

635
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,044
We will live together
in eternity.

636
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,813
No.

637
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,281
No?

638
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,920
My answer
will always be "no".

639
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,293
Go.

640
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,897
You want to kill me again?

641
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,966
Doesn't this game ever get
too old for you, Gareeb?

642
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,569
It's Captain Hunter,
if you don't mind.

643
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,870
Oh.

644
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,940
I'm here to make sure
you never build a Firestorm...

645
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,775
And for my watch, actually.

646
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:41,778
You stole it from me
during a pagan blood ritual

647
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,246
Back in 1975.

648
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:48,685
Ring any bells?

649
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,887
Ah, ah.

650
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,122
Slowly.

651
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,795
I have no desire
to kill you.

652
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,564
I want you alive.

653
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:04,234
I want you to see
the world burn.

654
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,904
I have looked so often
at your wife and son

655
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,906
These last 11 years...

656
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,309
Miranda and Jonas,

657
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,212
Their faces etched
into my mind.

658
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,247
And when I finally get
to meet them,

659
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,683
I will let them know
that you and your friends

660
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,052
Are responsible
for their suffering.

661
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:25,122
Not if I see you first.

662
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,598
How's it going up there?

663
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,302
<i>Sara?
Sara, are you there?</i>

664
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,204
Now you're on the comm?

665
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,939
We need to get out of here.

666
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,659
Whoa! Don't shoot!
Grey's in there!

667
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,928
Lot of good
it would do anyhow.

668
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,996
Man, screw this!

669
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,364
What are you doing?

670
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,166
I'm getting Stein back.

671
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,834
We'll cover you.

672
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,519
I know you're in there, Grey!

673
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,122
And he's begging for you
to save yourself.

674
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,790
I wasn't talking to you.

675
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,627
I was talking
to Professor Stein.

676
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,498
Your mind is stronger
than hers, Grey.

677
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,367
I get it. I know why
you've been so hard on me.

678
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,902
You're trying to protect me.

679
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,572
You don't want to lose me
like you lost Ronnie.

680
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:52,442
And that's why I know you're not
gonna let her kill me.

681
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:53,944
'Cause I've had you inside
of my head,

682
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:57,480
And I know what a tough,
old son of a bitch you can be.

683
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:01,051
So you got to fight her,
because you and me,

684
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,752
we're Firestorm, Grey.

685
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,554
You and me!

686
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,493
Jefferson!

687
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,229
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

688
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,331
Yeah.

689
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,832
Not for long.

690
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,435
I tried to warn her.
Without the splicer and myself,

691
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,004
her nuclear powers
are dangerously unstable.

692
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,542
It appears Dr. Vostok
is having a bit of a meltdown.

693
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,644
It's... it's fascinating.

694
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,106
I think what he means
to say is "run".

695
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,615
<i>I'll have the jump ship</i>

696
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,817
<i>waiting just beyond
the main gate.</i>

697
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,166
<i>["We'll meet again"

Courtesy of Yuri the bear.

699
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,746
How did you even have time
to steal this?

700
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,881
There's always time
to steal.

701
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,249
Thank you.

702
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,285
And just so you know,

703
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,253
I know you're more
than just a thief.

704
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,022
You took a beating for me.

705
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,823
We're even.
End of story.

706
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,158
Well, thank you.

707
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,193
More drinking,
less feeling.

708
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,662
A toast to the first time

709
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,364
We haven't completely ruined
the time line.

710
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,999
Please tell me
that's true, Gideon.

711
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,468
The projections of the future
<i>are back to normal.</i>

712
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,637
- I'll drink to that.
- To Rip.

713
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,674
To things not going
according to his plan.

714
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,742
- To the Captain.
- To the Captain.

715
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,304
- All right.
- Hold on, Jefferson.

716
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,973
- You're not quite 21.
- Yo...

717
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:40,582
In 1986, the drinking age
in Russia was 12, so...

718
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,653
Well, perhaps we can
let it slide this one time.

719
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,890
After all,
you were the hero today.

720
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,092
- You saved my life.
- Oh, that?

721
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,627
That was no biggie.

722
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,763
Having merged with an insane
Russian scientist,

723
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:58,368
I now know how lucky I am
to have you as my partner.

724
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,538
Partners.

725
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,673
Stein doesn't know,
does he?

726
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,442
That I almost killed him?

727
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,278
That I advised you
to kill him.

728
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,679
It's funny.

729
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,815
When I was
in the league of assassins,

730
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:15,552
Failure to follow through
on a hit was unforgivable,

731
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,587
A thousand times
worse than death.

732
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,989
Maybe I'm losing my edge.

733
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,727
Or gaining a new one.

734
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,663
The fact that you didn't pull
the trigger speaks volumes.

735
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,131
You know, the safe move was
to kill Martin

736
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,400
With the cold war hanging
in the balance.

737
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:33,970
I would like to think
it was your humanity

738
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,773
That stayed your hand.

739
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:41,878
I'd like to think that too,
but I had some help.

740
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,852
What was that?

741
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,620
<i>We have been struck
with an explosive projectile.</i>

742
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,123
- No kidding.
- Everyone get strapped in now!

743
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,058
We're in the temporal zone.
I don't understand.

744
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,994
No one should be able to...

745
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,129
You were saying?

746
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>A scan of the vessel</i>

747
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,068
<i>Suggests that it is
the bounty hunter Chronos.</i>

748
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,270
Oh, man,
this guy has impeccable timing.

749
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,044
<i>He appears
to be following us.</i>

750
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,914
<i>Firing countermeasures.</i>

751
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,990
<i>Countermeasures effective.</i>

752
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:27,891
Have we lost him?

753
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:30,560
<i>Yes, but not his missile.</i>

754
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,529
<i>Our aft shield
is gravely compromised.</i>

755
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,964
Initiating
evasive maneuvers.

756
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,536
Ah!
The vodka was a bad choice.

757
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:44,507
<i>Impact in three, two, one.</i>

758
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:49,579
<i>Sir, we've just been
knocked out of the timestream.</i>

759
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,814
What does that mean?

760
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,649
It means we're crash-landing

761
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,351
In place and time.

762
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,566
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

763
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,000
This doesn't look like
the type of place

764
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,303
We want to linger out
in the open.

765
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,942
That looks a lot like
a Palmer tech building,

766
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,779
But why does it have
a Smoak logo on it?

767
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,781
Wait.
This is Star City.

768
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,050
I thought you said
the time line was safe.

769
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,854
Yeah, Star City was intact
in 2016.

770
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,689
This...

771
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,124
This is 2046.

772
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,392
Don't move!

773
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,128
Oh, thank god.

774
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,231
I said don't move.

775
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,967
It's me.

776
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,635
It's Sara.

777
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,837
Hey, Oliver, look,

778
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,640
I-I know it's been a long time,
but don't you remember

779
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,209
That Rip Hunter recruited us
to become legends?

780
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:58,848
I never heard
of any legends.

781
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,238
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
