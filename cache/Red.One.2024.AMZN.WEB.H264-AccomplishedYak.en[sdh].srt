I started to ditch science

then I'd change it on the computer.

What'd Kevin do?

519
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,125
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

520
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,750
But he's not even in jazz band.

521
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,458
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

522
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,250
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

523
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,541
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

524
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,041
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

525
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,125
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

Good. Send a message.

But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin

I think, if you don't need me here,
I might just go back to the car.

I told you not to touch anything.

It was an innocent mistake.

1321
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:04,083
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1322

Not innocent and not a mistake.

1323
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:09,583
Well, who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

1324
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:12,041
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1325
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,208
Guests come, they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

1326
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,791
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,500
Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

1328
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,750
You disappointed in me, too, Cal?

1329
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,875
I have no expectations of you, Jack,
so I can't be disappointed.

01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,708
You know, I got problems of my own.

that I don't have.

I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

If you look at it a certain way,
what choice did I even have?

You have every choice. It's all choices.

You decide to steal gold.

1338
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:59,541
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

Why?

A prison for but one.

1440
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,791
Krampus, I need to find him.

1441
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,750
Let me go.

1442
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,083
And why...

1443
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,166
would I do that?

1444
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,833
Because we need him.

1445
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,541
Now more than ever, we need him.

1446
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,041
And you know that.

1447
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,166
Let me go.

1448
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,125
Northerner.

1449
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,500
You are not going anywhere.

1450
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,541
You, get out.

1451
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,208
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1452
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:17,583
There is a price for this intrusion.

1453
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,875
Now and forever,

1454
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,208
Drift belongs to me.

1455
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,750
[laughter]

1456
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,708
So I can...

1457
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,500
just walk out of here?

1458
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,833
I suggest you run.

1459
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,958
You'll learn to love it here.

1460
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,708
Take him away.

1461
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,875
[crowd murmuring, laughing]

1462
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:47,416
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

1463
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,041
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

1464
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:51,958
Lord Krampus, um...

1465
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,541
you and I aren't so different.

1466
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:01,000
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

1467
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,416
Ah. Do you, now?

1468
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,708
Yeah.

1469
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,583
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1470
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:08,875
Bit of a gambler?

1471
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,375
Well, so am I.

1472
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:14,833
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1473
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,833
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

1474
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,833
- What?
- [laughter]

1475
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:23,000
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

1476
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,833
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

1477
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:28,541
so just hear me out.

1478
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,625
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

1479
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,708
If he wins, we walk.

1480
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,750
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1481
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,583
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

1482
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,250
No shame.

1483
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,625
Lot of people watching.

1484
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:50,583
Imbeciles.

1485
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,750
- I love it.

The rules are as follows:

The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1496

The first to be knocked out or die loses.

I'm sure you do.

1504

He's still your brother.

1505

And he never gave up on you.

1506

What would you know about it?

1507
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,958
I know him.

1508

and kill him on the first touch.

I'm gonna need you to say,

All right, so the, uh, snow globe,
what's the deal with that?

The "glossy pig"?

01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,583
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1761
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,708
What?

1762
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:50,041
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1763
01:36:50,125 --> 01:36:52,208
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

1764
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,625
You said it was for naughty people,
didn't you?

1765
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:55,083
Well, she said that, but...

1766
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,791
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1767
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:58,291
Look at me.

1768
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,583
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1769
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:05,708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1770
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,000
You're only in here be...

1771
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,916
because of me.

1772
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,708
What did you do?

1773
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:17,208
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1774
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:19,625
It's... long list.

1775
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,958
But bigger than any of that,
it's what I didn't do.

1776
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,875
What are you talking about?

1777
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,208
I've been a terrible father.

1778
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,875
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is.

1779
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,583
I haven't been around.

1780
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:43,625
I told myself I was doing you a favor,
which is bullshit.

1781
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:47,166
It was bad for you,
and it was terrible for me.

1782
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,333
I've made some mistakes, pal. I know that.

1783
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,750
But I also know that I can do better.

1784
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,958
And I know that's easier said than done.

1785
01:37:57,041 --> 01:38:00,625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

1786
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

1787
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1788
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,958
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1789
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:20,625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1790
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:24,541
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

1791
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:27,291
but I know I can do better,

1792
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:30,833
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1793
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:33,125
I will never stop trying.

[sighs]

1800
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:01,208
What just happened?

1801
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1802
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,541
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1803
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,333
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

1804

Ow.

1807
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,291
[sighs] Cal.

1808
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:30,000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

1809
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,750
Wonder Woman.

1810
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,000
It's him.

1811
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,250
You all right?

1812
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,375
Yeah. Yeah.

1813
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:38,916
It's good to see you.

1814
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,916
[Dylan] Dad?

1815
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,291
[Jack] Buddy, come here.

1816
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,791
I want you to meet some friends.

1817
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:47,958
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

1818
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,833
The one and only Dylan.

1819
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:51,250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1820
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,916
Welcome to the North Pole.

1821
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,250
Huh?

1822
01:39:57,333 --> 01:40:00,000
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1823
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,833
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1824
01:40:01,916 --> 01:40:04,250
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

1825
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:06,250
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1826
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,416
Cal, we saw her.

1827
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1828
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:11,375
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1829
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:12,541
to everybody on the list.

1830
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:15,291
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1831
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:16,541
Without him.

1832
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:18,125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1833
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

- [faint shouting]
- [muffled banging]

[Mrs. Claus] Cal.

Ma'am.

1842
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,500
Where is he?

- [Garcia growls]
