1
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,295
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,917
...on those accused.

3
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,540
On this...

4
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:39,696
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

5
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:42,132
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,560
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:48,113
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,014
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:55,793
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,097
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

11
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:03,117
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,861
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:10,132
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

14
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,538
<i>Guilty.</i>

15
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,647
<i>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</i>

16
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,069
<i>Guilty.</i>

17
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,140
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

18
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,436
It has therefore
now become your decision.

19
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,835
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,813
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,324
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

22
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:43,630
I swear it.

23
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:48,586
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:49,804
Both you...

25
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,116
...and then one day...

26
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:53,107
...your heirs!

27
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,715
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,881
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,122
Forgive me!

30
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:06,152
<i>Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.</i>

31
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,840
<i>Their protection
will ensure your strength.</i>

32
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:20,366
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:29,702
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,206
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:35,662
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,678
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,830
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,318
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,443
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,337
Stand aside, now.

41
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,463
Free!

42
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,633
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:40,543
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,663
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:48,130
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,329
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:53,564
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,842
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,896
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:59,163
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,111
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:06,429
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,349
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:09,822
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:14,144
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:16,725
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,326
Poor guy.

58
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,696
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,916
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,846
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,404
Hi.

62
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,545
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,467
Now, see, Jimmy,
you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,664
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,707
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,510
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,271
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:40,667
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,001
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,856
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,337
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:51,030
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,848
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,842
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.

75
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:01,559
Some of those hotels are bilking
those poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,822
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,987
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:11,638
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:16,114
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,456
No, Superman?

81
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,687
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,217
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,636
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,257
Darn.

85
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:33,947
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:37,785
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:40,794
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,131
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,390
Let me just turn on the lights
for you then.

90
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,910
Get the picture?

91
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:55,186
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:58,519
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to
let anything slip by her.

93
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:01,017
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,586
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:06,968
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:11,122
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,457
...dark hair.

98
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:16,440
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:19,090
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,524
...Superman.

101
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,255
Superman?

102
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:27,410
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:31,025
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:34,063
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,166
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:20,018
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:23,091
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,001
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:31,700
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,243
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,820
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,161
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,747
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,773
...the greatest genius in this world?

115
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,677
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,766
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,423
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:20,307
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,194
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,423
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,688
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:33,710
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:37,743
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,756
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,227
- Where?
- North.

126
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:44,144
Why?

127
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,553
To ski?

128
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,979
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:52,240
Some, like you, Otis,
have more than one.

130
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,260
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,902
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,867
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:05,135
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,954
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:14,258
...what's it for?

136
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,984
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,699
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:27,659
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:30,445
<i>I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?</i>

140
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,091
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,600
Boy.

142
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:43,978
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:48,685
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.

144
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:54,094
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:02,321
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,426
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:12,295
- too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:15,281
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,126
Hey.

150
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:22,027
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:25,161
Anyway, somebody's
gotta check up on those guys.

152
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,046
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,860
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:33,840
The whole world's forgotten about it.

155
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:38,057
<i>Houston calling Artemis II.</i>

156
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:41,550
<i>Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.</i>

157
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,167
<i>Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.</i>

158
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:46,191
<i>- Yo.
- How are things going?</i>

159
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,295
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,239
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,604
<i>More rocks. Nice.</i>

162
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,736
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,359
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,847
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,220
Just a little détente
humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,293
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

167
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,367
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:15,398
<i>...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.</i>

169
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,640
<i>Right.</i>

170
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,788
<i>Look, Nate?</i>

171
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,479
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

172
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,103
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,443
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

174
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,534
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:32,045
Unidentified?

176
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:35,207
<i>- What does it look like?
- Well...</i>

177
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,961
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,137
You.

179
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:04,195
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,949
A man?

181
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:04,006
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,884
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,392
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:42,114
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,492
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,702
Houston!

187
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,745
Come on.

188
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:52,229
Come on, Houston!

189
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,400
Oh, no. No!

190
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:57,702
Somebody help me!

191
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,879
<i>- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?</i>

192
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,345
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:12,132
Well, we really...

194
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,470
<i>Artemis, come in, please.</i>

195
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:20,259
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:27,142
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:31,079
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,496
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:41,634
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,556
...a yellow sun...

201
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,517
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:49,412
They come from there.

203
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,485
A place called Houston.

204
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,958
Then we will go there too...

205
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,974
...to rule.

206
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,977
Finally, to rule.

207
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,689
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,828
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,738
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,874
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,347
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:28,032
I said, lights out.

213
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:34,048
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,011
I told you to...

215
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,943
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,291
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:31,961
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,195
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:37,600
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:42,910
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:46,110
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:49,855
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,775
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:01,212
Go out there and find it.

225
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:06,168
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:19,484
I think I found it.

227
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:26,239
What is it?

228
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,952
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,065
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:41,786
Come on.

231
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:46,041
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:48,733
Come on, hurry.

233
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:51,966
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:55,806
<i>- yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.</i>

235
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:58,588
<i>But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...</i>

236
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:04,951
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,609
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:10,425
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:14,747
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:33,143
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:35,897
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,886
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,706
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,050
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:44,086
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,914
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,670
Hot air rises.

248
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,122
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,459
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:57,373
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,838
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,396
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,690
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,895
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,202
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:12,340
That's possible.

257
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:17,722
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,031
Due north.

259
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,780
Lex, north.

260
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:25,304
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,026
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,880
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:32,315
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,550
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,889
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:04,984
Excuse me.

267
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:11,447
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,303
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:16,187
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,731
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,241
Certainly, dear.

272
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:32,985
Mush! Mush!

273
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,090
I am mushing.

274
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:40,155
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:44,243
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:13,653
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:15,443
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,026
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,976
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:26,742
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,094
Right.

282
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,386
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:40,343
Move out of the way.

284
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,053
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,876
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,863
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:51,250
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:56,272
Come on.

289
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:09,615
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:12,662
It's fantastic!

291
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:19,957
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:25,268
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,093
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:28,881
No, me.

295
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,358
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,256
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:40,758
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:46,096
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,054
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,058
Get!

301
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:59,699
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:02,066
Why doesn't the guy
put up some pictures?

303
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,651
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,836
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:15,245
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,228
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:45,265
<i>The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...</i>

308
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:47,534
<i>- What the...?
...owning a certain conviction...</i>

309
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,417
<i>...that what has been done is right.</i>

310
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:52,653
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,570
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,068
<i>Develop such conviction in yourself.</i>

313
00:32:58,325 --> 00:32:59,502
Are you here?

314
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,530
<i>- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.</i>

315
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:07,857
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,929
<i>Lies, monstrous deceptions.</i>

317
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:15,538
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,487
Give me another crystal.

319
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:30,345
<i>Education crystal 108. Earth culture.</i>

320
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,953
<i>A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-El.</i>

321
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:37,611
<i>Trees by Joyce Kilmer.</i>

322
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:39,920
<i>I think that I shall never see</i>

323
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,865
<i>A poem as lovely as a tree.</i>

324
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,152
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:48,657
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,445
Cute.

327
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,739
<i>My son...</i>

328
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,823
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:04,908
<i>...the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.</i>

330
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,692
<i>- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...</i>

331
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:11,022
<i>...even on our peaceful planet...</i>

332
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,453
<i>...there have appeared
once in a great while...</i>

333
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,749
<i>...certain antisocial elements.</i>

334
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:18,416
<i>Deviants...</i>

335
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,433
<i>...what you call on Earth "criminals."</i>

336
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,867
Criminals.

337
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,422
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:27,441
<i>Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...</i>

339
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:31,016
<i>...and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...</i>

340
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:33,967
<i>...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?</i>

341
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:37,325
<i>There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.</i>

342
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:40,074
<i>- who proved impossible to rehabilitate.</i>

343
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:41,832
There's hope.

344
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,073
<i>Non, the destroyer.</i>

345
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,364
<i>Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.</i>

346
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:52,909
<i>Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...</i>

347
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:55,014
<i>...which could never be determined.</i>

348
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,071
<i>And the one force
that could unite them...</i>

349
00:34:57,232 --> 00:35:01,607
<i>...the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:</i>

350
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:02,986
<i>General Zod.</i>

351
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,902
<i>- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...</i>

352
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:10,220
<i>...was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.</i>

353
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,615
<i>But after a long and terrible battle...</i>

354
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:15,753
<i>...peace and harmony
were once again restored.</i>

355
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,382
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,781
<i>We had, of course, no death penalty.</i>

357
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,662
Sensible enough.

358
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:26,085
<i>And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...</i>

359
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:32,808
<i>...to be imprisoned for all eternity.</i>

360
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,585
<i>I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.</i>

361
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:39,399
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

362
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:44,106
<i>On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...</i>

363
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,665
<i>...that you have.</i>

364
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,334
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:54,285
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:58,439
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,052
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:05,929
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:10,349
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,190
Too true to be good.

371
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:15,690
Right?

372
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,584
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,760
I think.

374
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,248
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:33,161
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,567
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:39,370
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,500
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:45,764
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,748
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,658
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:54,090
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,036
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:57,960
- No, I've got it. No, I...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:01,091
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,853
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,133
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:07,050
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,945
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,544
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,650
Get down! Get down!

392
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:21,568
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:27,199
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,913
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,319
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:37,159
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,170
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:43,626
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:46,175
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,037
Him again, huh?

401
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,441
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,805
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:56,036
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:57,249
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,759
Hot dog.

406
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:00,415
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:02,560
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,488
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,568
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:19,396
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,606
Oh, my God!

412
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,167
Help!

413
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:29,028
Help!

414
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,324
Somebody help!

415
00:38:33,673 --> 00:38:35,461
Do something!

416
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:40,764
Good.

417
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:43,301
Hey, Superman!

418
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,691
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,975
We got a great shot.

420
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:54,013
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:38:57,512 --> 00:38:58,941
Incredible.

422
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:08,387
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:11,650
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:15,612
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,888
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,349
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,583
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:26,589
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,178
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,366
A very strange surface.

431
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,231
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:40:27,396 --> 00:40:30,266
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:33,785
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:36,476
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,651
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:41,342
Well, anyway...

437
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,606
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:47,325
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:49,793
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:52,160
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,014
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,017
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:40:57,187 --> 00:41:01,497
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,798
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,938
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:09,725
...I'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:13,339
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:18,235
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of girls who'd...

450
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,446
Well, a few girls anyway.

451
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,521
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:27,929
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:33,567
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,447
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,504
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,881
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,577
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:50,458
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,419
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,146
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:59,866
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,975
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,512
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:06,200
There, that's better.

465
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:09,685
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:13,501
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:16,152
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,492
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:21,951
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,534
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,563
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,477
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,095
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,573
Him who?

475
00:42:36,736 --> 00:42:40,119
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:43,354
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:47,033
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,583
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:42:50,752 --> 00:42:53,949
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:56,413
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,746
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:02,750
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,621
...all around the world, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,124
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,964
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:15,444
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:19,193
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,944
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,288
...and you were gone.

490
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:24,598
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:27,965
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:30,905
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:34,419
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:36,313
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:38,649
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:40,952
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,892
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:43:46,686 --> 00:43:48,595
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:50,740
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,975
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,116
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:09,622
It is you.

503
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,515
I guess I've known this
for the longest time.

504
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:23,000
You realize, of course...

505
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:26,034
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,046
With a blank?

507
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:34,389
Gotcha.

508
00:44:57,724 --> 00:45:00,309
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,260
Did you see that?

510
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:13,620
Did you see what I did?

511
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:16,241
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:18,294
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,968
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:05,072
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:08,725
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:46:08,888 --> 00:46:11,092
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,585
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,783
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:18,512
Good.

520
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,753
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:40,080
I don't know.

522
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:44,049
From the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

523
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:56,724
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

524
00:46:57,078 --> 00:47:00,045
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:02,544
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,945
Make way.

527
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:07,474
Did I hear right?

528
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,362
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,789
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:19,281
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:21,389
What is this symbol?

532
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:23,282
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:25,682
Follow the leader?

534
00:47:26,806 --> 00:47:29,075
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:31,343
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:42,448
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,155
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:56,850
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,748
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:10,381
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,483
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:20,462
No. No, I really...

543
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:22,700
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:24,940
Even though I do
make a fool of myself.

545
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,834
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,955
But he is you.

547
00:48:36,692 --> 00:48:39,889
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:43,602
Everything's clear.

549
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:51,694
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:56,082
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:57,617
- has increased by three.

552
00:48:57,778 --> 00:49:00,680
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,436
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...

554
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:06,668
<i>...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?</i>

555
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:08,721
<i>Get that guy. Follow the guy.</i>

556
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:10,443
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

557
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:13,040
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a...</i>

558
00:49:13,362 --> 00:49:14,988
<i>- You got that?
- No.</i>

559
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:20,845
<i>- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

560
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,865
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,735
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,002
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:32,398
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:36,583
You may continue.

565
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:40,266
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:49:41,265 --> 00:49:43,207
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:46,672
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:49,450
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

569
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,367
<i>This is an order.</i>

570
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,735
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:22,086
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,427
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:26,954
<i>Yes? Yes.</i>

574
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,659
<i>The Newsbeat control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...</i>

575
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:35,206
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,580
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:39,118
Where's Superman?

578
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:42,214
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:55,272
<i>Fire again.</i>

580
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,893
<i>Fire again.</i>

581
00:51:01,998 --> 00:51:05,314
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:08,647
<i>- Banking now.
- What bravery.</i>

583
00:51:08,974 --> 00:51:12,771
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:18,151
<i>Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.</i>

585
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,350
<i>We're out of control.</i>

586
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:26,537
<i>We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!</i>

587
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:27,911
<i>We're coming down.</i>

588
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:35,500
I win.

589
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:38,853
I always win.

590
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,145
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:52:02,316 --> 00:52:03,723
Come forward.

592
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:05,867
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:10,183
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:15,330
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,962
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:22,880
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:25,476
In return for your obedience...

598
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,196
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:32,072
In other words,
you will be allowed to live.

600
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:37,344
So you are a general?

601
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:40,420
And who is your superior?

602
00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:46,083
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:50,950
Or all of his cities
will end up like this one.

604
00:52:56,714 --> 00:53:00,193
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:03,361
Imagine what they'll do
to the world if we resist.

606
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:10,310
<i>The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-El.</i>

607
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:14,052
<i>You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.</i>

608
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:20,703
<i>And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.</i>

609
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:25,928
<i>My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.</i>

610
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:27,846
<i>This was one I'd...</i>

611
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,080
<i>I'd hoped you would not ask.</i>

612
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:36,008
My attachment...

613
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:43,046
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:45,572
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:50,013
<i>You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...</i>

616
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:52,224
<i>...at the expense of the rest.</i>

617
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:57,028
<i>- The concepts are mutually exclusive.
- And...</i>

618
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,786
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:06,983
<i>Is this how you repay their gratitude?</i>

620
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,787
<i>By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...</i>

621
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:13,472
<i>...for the sake of your selfish pursuits?</i>

622
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:16,966
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:19,615
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:22,237
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,927
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,224
<i>Yours is a higher happiness.</i>

627
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:32,580
<i>The fulfillment of your mission,
an inspiration you must have felt.</i>

628
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:35,973
<i>You must have felt
that happiness within you.</i>

629
00:54:36,263 --> 00:54:39,263
<i>My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.</i>

630
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,818
No, I cannot...

631
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:47,171
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,729
So much stronger.

633
00:54:55,494 --> 00:54:57,533
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,947
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:06,241
<i>If you will not be Kal-El...</i>

636
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,452
<i>...if you will live as one of them...</i>

637
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:10,907
<i>...love their kind as one of them...</i>

638
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:13,566
<i>...then it follows that you must...</i>

639
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:16,252
<i>...become one of them.</i>

640
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:49,184
<i>This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

641
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,009
<i>Once exposed to them...</i>

642
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:54,553
<i>...all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.</i>

643
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:56,888
<i>Forever.</i>

644
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,481
<i>Once this is done, there's no going back.</i>

645
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,201
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

646
00:56:04,196 --> 00:56:07,131
<i>And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.</i>

647
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:11,040
<i>Think, Kal-El.</i>

648
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,012
<i>I beg you.</i>

649
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:16,604
Father...

650
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:18,972
...I love her.

651
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,719
<i>Think, Kal-El.</i>

652
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,352
Come on. Come on.

653
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:42,934
Look out!

654
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,882
You are the one they call president?

655
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,180
I am.

656
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:41,881
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
00:59:43,196 --> 00:59:44,821
Good.

658
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:47,732
Rise before Zod.

659
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:54,395
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:09,489
You are not the president.

661
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:14,358
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:00:14,522 --> 01:00:16,245
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:19,318
I am the president.

664
01:00:20,218 --> 01:00:22,356
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:24,437
It will.

666
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:27,056
Starting with your own.

667
01:00:30,617 --> 01:00:33,684
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:36,823
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:38,898
...and the jewelry.

670
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,623
What I do now...

671
01:00:53,786 --> 01:00:56,851
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

672
01:00:57,017 --> 01:01:00,847
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:04,276
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:06,350
I wish I knew.

675
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,830
Oh, God.

676
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:13,773
Zod.

677
01:01:16,312 --> 01:01:17,686
Hey.

678
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:20,270
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:25,076
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,622
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:32,782
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:36,302
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:40,246
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:42,065
Hurry up.

685
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,053
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:01:47,127 --> 01:01:49,363
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:55,219
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,962
Thank you.

689
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,729
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:06,317
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:09,644
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:13,262
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:16,944
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,811
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:02:20,982 --> 01:02:22,444
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:02:22,678 --> 01:02:25,230
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:27,090
Coming right up.

698
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:30,794
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:33,781
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,047
No, thank you.

701
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:39,122
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:42,315
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:48,915
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:02:50,005 --> 01:02:52,395
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:54,954
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:58,515
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,326
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:03:04,468 --> 01:03:07,086
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:03:07,637 --> 01:03:11,248
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:13,931
After you.

711
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,368
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,587
Clark!

713
01:03:22,707 --> 01:03:24,082
You all right, fella?

714
01:03:24,244 --> 01:03:26,894
He's gonna be fine,
just give me that.

715
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:30,602
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:35,438
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,920
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:03:39,092 --> 01:03:41,131
I know that, Lois.

719
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:43,438
I wish he were here.

720
01:03:48,883 --> 01:03:50,541
Clark.

721
01:03:51,859 --> 01:03:54,958
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:05,677
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:04:06,387 --> 01:04:08,491
Settle down!

724
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:11,376
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,247
Oh, God.

726
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:24,881
Clark? Clark?

727
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:26,765
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:29,514
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:31,404
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,723
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:40,553
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:42,924
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:46,446
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

734
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:49,391
<i>...from the President
of the United States.</i>

735
01:04:49,616 --> 01:04:51,853
<i>This is your president.</i>

736
01:04:52,113 --> 01:04:56,749
<i>On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the world...</i>

737
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:59,849
<i>...with whom I have today consulted...</i>

738
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:03,019
<i>...I hereby abdicate...</i>

739
01:05:03,248 --> 01:05:07,340
<i>...all authority and
control over this planet...</i>

740
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:09,318
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

741
01:05:10,096 --> 01:05:11,242
Zod.

742
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:14,791
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

743
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:19,365
<i>...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.</i>

744
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:21,415
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

745
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:25,196
<i>- Superman, where?
- Who is this Superman?</i>

746
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:31,175
<i>- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.</i>

747
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:32,870
<i>I defy you.</i>

748
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,355
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

749
01:05:38,704 --> 01:05:40,077
<i>Zod!</i>

750
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,274
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:47,051
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,336
I have to go back.

753
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:53,390
You can't go back.

754
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,972
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:05:56,142 --> 01:05:59,209
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:02,124
It's not your fault.

757
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:05,548
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:06:06,894 --> 01:06:08,650
He knew.

759
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,985
I heard him.

760
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:13,321
I just didn't listen.

761
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:31,780
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,837
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:06:33,998 --> 01:06:36,386
And the day before.

764
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:50,918
Hello, there.

765
01:06:52,428 --> 01:06:54,251
Lex Luthor.

766
01:06:56,557 --> 01:06:58,596
Lex Luthor.

767
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:01,834
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:04,869
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:06,596
Wait just a moment.

770
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:09,764
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:07:09,932 --> 01:07:13,477
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:15,554
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:20,262
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:25,155
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:29,479
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:33,673
We have all of this without you.

777
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:36,515
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:39,266
Magnificent One...

779
01:07:40,203 --> 01:07:43,464
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,935
The son of Jor-El.

781
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:50,790
The son of Jor-El?

782
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:52,575
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:55,619
Jor-El, our jailer?

784
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:57,922
No, Jor-El, the baseball player.

785
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:59,999
Yes, Jor-El, your jailer.

786
01:08:00,297 --> 01:08:03,647
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:08:03,819 --> 01:08:06,307
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...</i>

788
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:09,441
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,334
Superman.

790
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:15,138
So this is Superman.

791
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,670
How do you know of Jor-El?

792
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:22,089
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:08:23,114 --> 01:08:24,543
...I'm about the best there is.

794
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:25,957
Revenge.

795
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:28,031
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:08:28,201 --> 01:08:31,048
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:33,151
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,263
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:39,589
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:42,470
...he's just one...

801
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:45,087
...where you are three.

802
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,062
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,913
Wait!

804
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:53,634
First, you must find him.

805
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:57,093
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,957
What do you want?

807
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,200
Well, general...

808
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:05,823
...the world is a big place.

809
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:08,326
Thank goodness...

810
01:09:08,488 --> 01:09:10,375
...my needs are small.

811
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:17,348
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:09:19,015 --> 01:09:21,403
What do you want?

813
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:23,266
Australia.

814
01:09:53,509 --> 01:09:54,972
Hey.

815
01:09:57,605 --> 01:10:01,883
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:10:37,924 --> 01:10:39,450
Father?

817
01:10:41,957 --> 01:10:43,931
If you can hear me...

818
01:10:45,572 --> 01:10:47,394
...I failed.

819
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:51,522
I failed you...

820
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:53,503
...I failed myself...

821
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:57,306
...and all humanity.

822
01:11:00,098 --> 01:11:02,172
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:07,840
...for a life of submission in a world
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:11,865
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,498
...the people of the world.

826
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:17,465
Not since I...

827
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:21,339
Father!

828
01:12:29,488 --> 01:12:33,897
<i>Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.</i>

829
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:38,184
<i>If you hear me now...</i>

830
01:12:38,352 --> 01:12:41,254
<i>...then you have made use
of the only means left to you:</i>

831
01:12:42,128 --> 01:12:45,903
<i>The crystal source through which
our communications begun.</i>

832
01:12:46,832 --> 01:12:49,134
<i>The circle is now complete.</i>

833
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:52,553
<i>You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El.</i>

834
01:12:55,824 --> 01:12:59,207
<i>You did this of your own free will...</i>

835
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:02,410
<i>...in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.</i>

836
01:13:04,623 --> 01:13:06,149
I...

837
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,629
<i>Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.</i>

838
01:13:10,799 --> 01:13:15,501
<i>This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.</i>

839
01:13:18,062 --> 01:13:20,135
<i>Look at me, Kal-El.</i>

840
01:13:22,478 --> 01:13:26,886
<i>Once before when you were small,
I died...</i>

841
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:30,925
<i>...while giving you a chance for life.</i>

842
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:35,810
<i>And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...</i>

843
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:38,250
Father, no.

844
01:13:39,693 --> 01:13:42,060
<i>Look at me, Kal-El.</i>

845
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:49,289
<i>The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.</i>

846
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:54,883
<i>The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.</i>

847
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:02,955
<i>Farewell forever, Kal-El.</i>

848
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:08,460
<i>Remember me, my son.</i>

849
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,786
My son.

850
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,364
Father!

851
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:11,774
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:14,913
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:15:15,754 --> 01:15:17,247
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,868
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:15:21,034 --> 01:15:24,995
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad
that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:15:25,162 --> 01:15:29,701
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:15:30,153 --> 01:15:32,358
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:15:32,554 --> 01:15:34,464
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

859
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:36,706
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:39,394
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:15:39,562 --> 01:15:42,944
- If there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:15:45,386 --> 01:15:47,557
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:50,055
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,686
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:15:53,706 --> 01:15:55,199
Oh, my!

866
01:16:01,065 --> 01:16:03,617
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:06,948
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:16:18,056 --> 01:16:19,233
This is scary!

869
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:08,351
You all right, chief?

870
01:17:08,839 --> 01:17:10,180
Hi.

871
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:14,821
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:16,259
Lex Luthor.

873
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:17,984
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:17:18,598 --> 01:17:21,316
This is the son of Jor-El?

875
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:23,300
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:27,355
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

877
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:29,886
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,917
But what I've given
you is the next best thing.

879
01:17:34,085 --> 01:17:36,988
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:38,651
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,977
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:45,694
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:49,119
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,061
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:17:52,549 --> 01:17:54,076
Wait!

886
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:55,553
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:58,721
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:03,545
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:05,210
Wait. Wait.

890
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:09,308
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,353
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:18:22,467 --> 01:18:23,613
General...

893
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:26,523
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:18:26,722 --> 01:18:28,665
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:18:29,603 --> 01:18:30,912
I mean, get him!

896
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,056
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

897
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,256
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,184
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:19:10,978 --> 01:19:12,471
Son of Jor-El.

900
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:15,385
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:19:15,746 --> 01:19:16,956
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:20,153
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,591
Like father, like son.

904
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,549
Look out!

905
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:45,148
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,986
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:19:57,248 --> 01:19:59,222
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:35,285
<i>Superman.</i>

909
01:20:55,454 --> 01:20:57,724
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:07,965
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,175
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:21:33,534 --> 01:21:35,867
Help my baby!

913
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:40,246
Thank you.

914
01:21:41,757 --> 01:21:45,172
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:21:45,373 --> 01:21:47,674
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,179
He cares.

917
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,567
He actually cares
for these Earth people.

918
01:21:52,732 --> 01:21:55,766
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:22:03,612 --> 01:22:05,435
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:07,450
...with some of my own.

921
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,475
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:22:38,778 --> 01:22:40,186
Get out of the way!

923
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,327
Superman.

924
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:38,356
Oh, thank you!

925
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:40,974
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:24:54,614 --> 01:24:56,621
No! Don't do it!

927
01:24:57,046 --> 01:24:58,638
The people!

928
01:25:03,093 --> 01:25:04,817
Throw it!

929
01:25:25,173 --> 01:25:28,336
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:25:31,732 --> 01:25:35,048
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:38,538
Superman is dead.

932
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:42,862
They've killed Superman.

933
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:46,448
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:25:46,612 --> 01:25:49,099
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:51,081
Come on!

936
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,796
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:26:22,962 --> 01:26:25,264
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:26:30,034 --> 01:26:33,034
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,487
You can't leave us!

940
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,124
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:51,973
He's gone.

942
01:27:52,143 --> 01:27:53,605
Come back, Superman!

943
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:00,073
Don't leave us!

944
01:28:02,863 --> 01:28:04,773
He chickened out.

945
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:06,278
Phony!

946
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:09,422
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,718
Come on, let's go.

948
01:28:18,446 --> 01:28:22,091
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:28:30,735 --> 01:28:32,490
Our victory is complete.

950
01:28:32,654 --> 01:28:34,344
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:37,095
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:28:37,261 --> 01:28:41,156
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:28:41,326 --> 01:28:44,292
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:28:44,461 --> 01:28:46,730
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:28:46,893 --> 01:28:50,189
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:28:51,181 --> 01:28:53,156
The next time?

957
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:55,877
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:58,533
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,906
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:05,225
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:10,377
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:29:10,572 --> 01:29:14,217
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:29:14,637 --> 01:29:17,288
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:21,414
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:29:21,868 --> 01:29:23,395
- Superman's address?

966
01:29:27,117 --> 01:29:32,234
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:29:32,396 --> 01:29:35,145
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:29:35,307 --> 01:29:38,209
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:39,940
What more?

970
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,021
Cuba.

971
01:29:49,707 --> 01:29:55,686
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.

972
01:29:55,882 --> 01:29:58,021
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:44,321
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:49,219
Son of a coward!

975
01:30:55,338 --> 01:30:56,581
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:30:56,969 --> 01:30:59,871
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,928
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:31:02,345 --> 01:31:03,555
Stop.

979
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:05,631
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,898
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:31:09,193 --> 01:31:10,370
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:12,801
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:31:14,248 --> 01:31:16,550
But you are victim
to another fatal weakness...

984
01:31:16,968 --> 01:31:18,342
...your compassion.

985
01:31:18,504 --> 01:31:20,871
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:31:21,032 --> 01:31:22,439
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:31:22,856 --> 01:31:28,158
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:31:28,424 --> 01:31:30,399
You will live, Kal-El, forever...

989
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:35,357
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:40,830
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:42,559
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:48,737
All right, Zod.

993
01:31:49,382 --> 01:31:50,757
It's over.

994
01:31:53,478 --> 01:31:57,090
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:31:59,206 --> 01:32:01,312
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:05,027
We will destroy this place.

997
01:32:05,512 --> 01:32:06,853
And then kill him.

998
01:32:09,062 --> 01:32:10,851
Him.

999
01:32:11,975 --> 01:32:14,789
Him? Me?

1000
01:32:16,134 --> 01:32:17,989
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:22,046
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:32:22,214 --> 01:32:24,002
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:32:24,517 --> 01:32:28,412
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:32:28,582 --> 01:32:29,988
Silence!

1005
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:31,677
Well, look...

1006
01:32:34,085 --> 01:32:35,547
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,109
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:32:38,693 --> 01:32:41,694
Promises were made,
gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:45,122
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:32:45,317 --> 01:32:48,001
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1011
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:52,771
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:32:52,933 --> 01:32:54,972
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,628
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:32:57,797 --> 01:32:58,942
Now, if you could...

1015
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:05,054
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:06,841
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:10,721
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,245
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:33:14,404 --> 01:33:15,930
Seize him.

1020
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,579
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:33:19,747 --> 01:33:21,787
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:33:22,307 --> 01:33:23,901
You win.

1023
01:33:26,979 --> 01:33:31,355
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:34,241
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:33:34,404 --> 01:33:36,029
...activate the machine.

1026
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:48,665
With your permission.

1027
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:01,566
And now, finally...

1028
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:07,193
Kneel.

1029
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,822
Take my hand...

1030
01:35:14,016 --> 01:35:19,548
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:35:57,982 --> 01:35:59,291
He switched it.

1032
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,756
He did it to them.

1033
01:36:02,462 --> 01:36:07,645
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:36:08,957 --> 01:36:10,866
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:36:11,197 --> 01:36:13,238
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:24,505
Are you all right?

1037
01:36:25,628 --> 01:36:29,208
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:31,449
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:36:31,613 --> 01:36:35,508
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:36:35,677 --> 01:36:37,749
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:36:37,981 --> 01:36:40,316
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:36:40,573 --> 01:36:43,639
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:45,948
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:48,346
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:36:48,509 --> 01:36:51,639
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:38:05,691 --> 01:38:07,185
Look, Lois...

1047
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:10,486
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:13,138
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:19,442
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:24,147
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:38:24,313 --> 01:38:26,615
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,127
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:38:37,401 --> 01:38:39,571
But it just can't be...

1054
01:39:01,111 --> 01:39:03,250
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:39:04,056 --> 01:39:05,365
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:39:28,856 --> 01:39:31,888
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:39:33,048 --> 01:39:36,363
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:40,277
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:39:41,046 --> 01:39:45,868
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,448
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:39:54,998 --> 01:39:56,524
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:01,165
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:40:25,365 --> 01:40:27,666
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,452
Up, up and away.

1065
01:41:52,402 --> 01:41:55,085
- No!
- No!

1066
01:42:21,328 --> 01:42:23,368
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:42:23,536 --> 01:42:27,311
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:42:42,991 --> 01:42:45,097
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:42:45,264 --> 01:42:47,500
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:42:47,664 --> 01:42:49,322
That's what they said.

1071
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,166
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:42:58,608 --> 01:43:00,168
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:07,403
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:10,185
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:13,449
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:43:14,383 --> 01:43:16,488
The North Pole.

1077
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:19,173
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:25,478
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:43:25,806 --> 01:43:27,562
No, you never did.

1080
01:43:28,334 --> 01:43:33,800
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single
most important story of my career...

1081
01:43:33,965 --> 01:43:35,973
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:43:36,493 --> 01:43:39,941
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:43,241
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the world or saved the universe.

1084
01:43:43,405 --> 01:43:47,180
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:43:47,341 --> 01:43:49,926
Now, there's some things
that you can do too.

1086
01:43:50,893 --> 01:43:52,419
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:43:52,589 --> 01:43:55,240
Really? Like what?

1088
01:43:56,685 --> 01:43:57,831
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:43:58,573 --> 01:44:02,151
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:44:02,606 --> 01:44:05,027
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:07,052
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:44:07,213 --> 01:44:08,587
I'm going.

1093
01:44:13,549 --> 01:44:14,923
Lois?

1094
01:44:15,372 --> 01:44:16,617
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:44:17,837 --> 01:44:21,132
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:44:23,244 --> 01:44:25,153
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:44:45,963 --> 01:44:48,265
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:44:48,428 --> 01:44:50,151
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1099
01:44:50,315 --> 01:44:52,966
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:56,643
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:44:57,899 --> 01:45:02,055
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,512
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:14,951
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1104
01:45:19,402 --> 01:45:21,093
Now cool it, Rocky.

1105
01:45:22,217 --> 01:45:23,298
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:45:23,466 --> 01:45:26,761
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:45:42,698 --> 01:45:44,706
Oh, God!

1108
01:45:55,945 --> 01:45:57,984
This order's to go.

1109
01:46:05,417 --> 01:46:09,127
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1110
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,142
I've been working out.
