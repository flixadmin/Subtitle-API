8
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,702
Is it ready?

9
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,803
Hey! That's a great punch.

10
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,059
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

11
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,877
Breathe. Breathe.

12
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,303
Wait.

13
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,083
Okay.

14
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,341
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

15
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay. Okay.

16
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,369
Shut that off! Turn it off!

17
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,416
Watch out!

18
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,656
Okay!

19
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,077
That's not right.

20
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,186
Oh, you.

21
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,533
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

22
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,713
Damn it!

23
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,445
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

24
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,865
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

25
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,912
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.

26
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,458
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.

27
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,794
Wow.

28
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,175
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

29
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,054
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

30
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,557
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

31
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,748
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

32
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,834
And I pulled you one ace.

33
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:03,260
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

34
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,137
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

35
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,437
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

36
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,482
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

37
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,704
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

38
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,706
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

39
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,125
but live fire is for backup only.

40
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,836
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

41
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,546
Is he a fighter?

42
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,884
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

43
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,219
who stole military secrets.

44
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:50,891
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

45
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,811
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

46
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,981
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

47
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,901
Tranq him and bring him back.

48
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,027
Oh, come on.

49
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,258
Camera.

50
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,012
Here we go.

51
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,234
Get rid of the damn dog.

52
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,122
Take him!

53
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,719
Target's on the move.

54
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,353
Where is he?

55
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,070
He's on the ground.

56
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,905
- Let's go!
- Go!

57
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,824
Move, move!

58
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,014
Go, go, go!

59
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,975
GO! Go!

60
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,605
Clear everyone out!

61
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,024
Do not lose him!

62
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,113
Oh! No!

63
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,019
Get around behind him!

64
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,190
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

65
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,081
Oh, no.

66
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,334
You got to be kidding me.

67
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,200
- Where is he?
- Target acquired.

68
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,214
Gringo!

69
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,565
Let's go.

70
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,413
No!

71
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,832
Please! No!

72
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,711
Not the computer!

73
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,296
Gimme that! No!

74
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:40,068
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

75
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,947
Oh, no.

76
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,826
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

77
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,931
Anybody else seeing this?

78
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,924
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advise.

79
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,010
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

80
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,595
Do it now!

81
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,730
Go live! Go live! Go live!

82
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,607
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

83
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,276
No!

84
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,394
It's behind us! Move! Move!

85
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,279
Get him!

86
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,115
Shoot!

87
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,090
Leave me alone.

88
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,621
No! No!

89
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,553
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

90
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,014
He had it on him when he bolted.

91
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,440
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

92
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,321
She is no longer a factor.

93
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,866
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

94
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:01,037
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

95
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,421
Forgive me, sir?

96
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,925
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

97
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,762
He didn't lose us.

98
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,641
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

99
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,060
And then something hit us, something...

100
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,979
Something big hit us!

101
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:32,276
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

102
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,948
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

103
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,451
Well, it's gone.

104
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,455
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

105
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,667
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

106
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,585
-and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

107
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,591
It

108
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,594
was Banner.

109
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:02,932
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

110
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,186
You've done a good job.

111
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:12,817
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

112
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,382
Wait.

113
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,344
Please.

114
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,978
Where am I?

115
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,558
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

116
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,768
I've seen good men go down

117
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,104
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

118
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,565
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

119
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,025
I mean, that's the job.

120
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,318
But this?

121
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,989
This is a whole new level of weird.

122
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,951
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

123
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,079
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

124
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,999
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

125
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,210
because if that thing shows up again,

126
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,965
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

127
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:42,925
Sir.

128
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,060
Tienes más stretchy?

129
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,148
Yeah. Perfecto.

130
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,598
Let me emphasize
that what I'm about to share with you

131
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,018
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

132
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,066
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development program.

133
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,779
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

134
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,448
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

135
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,367
Yeah, Super Soldier.

136
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,870
Yes.

137
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,998
An oversimplification, but yes.

138
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,711
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

139
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,506
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

140
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,841
We were tryin' to make you better.

141
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:56,558
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

142
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,228
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

143
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,606
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

144
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,236
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

145
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,114
And something went very wrong.

146
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,493
Or it went very right.

147
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:19,373
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

148
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,418
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

149
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,670
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

150
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,714
You were trying other things.

151
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,717
One serum we developed

152
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,261
was very promising.

153
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,972
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

154
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,225
He is not one of us.

155
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,607
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
-39.

156
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,987
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

157
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,363
So get out of the trenches.

158
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,866
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

159
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:58,203
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

160
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,498
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

161
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,334
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

162
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,256
I could probably arrange
something like that.

163
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,107
Take care, kids.

164
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,870
Stan, I give you my word,

165
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,705
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

166
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,917
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

167
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,794
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

168
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,592
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

169
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,969
She doesn't know that I'm here.

170
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:07,100
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

171
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,646
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

172
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,567
Good. That's good.

173
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:20,447
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

174
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,451
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

175
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,497
There is one other thing.

176
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,336
Excuse me. Pardon me.

177
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,422
Coming through.

178
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,971
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

179
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,306
I don't think there's anybody up there.

180
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,894
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

181
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,441
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

182
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,493
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

183
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,163
All right.

184
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,014
Okay.

185
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,923
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

186
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,426
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

187
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,303
Oh, kids.

188
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,931
I got nothing but marinara now.

189
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,100
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

190
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,394
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

191
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,236
Stan?

192
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,950
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

193
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,119
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

194
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,663
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

195
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,500
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

196
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,446
Bruce?

197
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,080
Betty? What's going on?

198
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,555
Betty...

199
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,767
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

200
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,772
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

201
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,732
Don't go. Don't go.

202
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,536
I want you to come with me now.

203
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,830
Please. Come with me.

204
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,499
Please.

205
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,197
It's our data.

206
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,160
I got in there before they carted it all away.

207
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,041
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

208
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:53,048
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

209
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,467
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

210
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,052
You have to be sure.

211
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:02,265
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

212
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:07,228
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

213
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:10,565
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

214
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,859
He wants to make it a weapon.

215
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,121
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:11,126
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

217
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,589
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

218
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:20,093
Really? You can't stay at all?

219
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,513
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

220
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,810
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

221
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,520
I need to take a bus.

222
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,314
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

223
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,443
Okay.

224
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,741
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

225
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:46,953
I.-

226
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,414
What?

227
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,960
- Good night.
- Good night.

228
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,045
I hope you get some rest.

229
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,840
We're giving you a very low dose only.

230
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,802
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

231
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,887
First sign of any side effect,

232
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,682
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

233
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,227
- Ag reed?
- Ag reed.

234
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,858
You'll get two separate infusions.

235
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:03,154
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centers.

236
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:05,573
The bone ones are going to hurt.

237
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,955
ls everything okay?

238
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,292
I think so.

239
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,968
Come here.

240
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,680
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

241
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,975
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

242
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,231
It feels too tight, huh?

243
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,150
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

244
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,577
- What?
- They're here.

245
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,329
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

246
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,663
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

247
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,248
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

248
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,553
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

249
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,180
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

250
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,683
He's heading 2-7-0.

251
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,494
Blonsky! Not yet!

252
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,080
Sir.

253
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,375
Look alive. This could get interesting.

254
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:09,549
I got him!

255
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,802
Stop! Stop!

256
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,014
I know you're in there!

257
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,475
General, please!

258
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,021
Sir?

259
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:24,897
Dad!

260
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:36,325
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

261
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,244
There he is!

262
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,538
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

263
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,790
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

264
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,089
He's locked in.

265
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,638
Put two canisters in there with him.

266
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,432
Fire!

267
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:19,619
Get her back here!

268
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,196
Now she'll see.

269
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,178
Alpha team?

270
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,140
Let him have all of it.

271
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,022
Come on, light him up!

272
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,571
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

273
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:25,953
Oh, my God!

274
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:30,625
Blonsky, now you're up!

275
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,335
Sir?

276
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,962
Cover me.

277
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,523
Remember me?

278
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:15,920
My God, he's doing it.

279
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,301
Move him toward the cannons!

280
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,433
Move!

281
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,282
Hold your position!

282
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,700
Do it now!

283
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,060
Please, please, please, no!

284
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,562
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

285
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,688
You're killing him!

286
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,107
Stop! Get off of me!

287
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,608
Bruce!

288
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:26,615
Bruce! Bruce!

289
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,063
Where's the gunship?

290
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:18,250
Is that it?

291
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,294
Blonsky, pull back now.

292
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,712
Pull back!

293
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,634
Is that all you got?

294
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,727
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

295
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,187
Find cover!

296
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,442
Betty!

297
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,374
Fire, goddamn it!

298
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,377
Bruce?

299
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:15,808
Stop firing!

300
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,781
No!

301
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:23,459
You did the right thing, calling us.

302
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,506
I need to know where they're going.

303
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,716
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

304
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,092
From who?

305
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,596
He protected her. You almost killed her.

306
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,475
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

307
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,228
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

308
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:45,272
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

309
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:46,774
And you are.

310
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,236
I don't know where he's going.

311
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:55,366
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

312
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:59,203
And I can't help either one of them.

313
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,336
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

314
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,088
Now I know!

315
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,303
Where does she meet these guys?

316
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,021
Bruce?

317
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,407
Bruce.

318
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,721
It's okay. It's okay.

319
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:56,654
Come here. Come this way.

320
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,492
Watch your head.

321
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,591
Okay.

322
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,687
We're okay.

323
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,943
It's okay.

324
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,530
It's just the rain.

325
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,999
Will he ever walk again?

326
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,628
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

327
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:58,549
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

328
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,802
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

329
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,532
Here.

330
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,035
Okay.

331
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,077
Bruce?

332
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,871
Oh, hi.

333
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,581
Are you okay?

334
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,208
Yeah.

335
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,752
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

336
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:01,421
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

337
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,132
You ate it?

338
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:08,428
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

339
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,596
Wow.

340
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:15,435
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

341
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,146
First thing's first.

342
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,857
Oh, you're kidding me.

343
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,243
What?

344
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,663
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

345
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,081
I'll take my chances.

346
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,750
Rumors continue
to swirl about a violent clash

347
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:42,671
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary

348
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,716
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.

349
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,052
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.

350
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:50,554
It was so big.

351
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,557
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.

352
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,685
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,

353
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,437
captured this on his cell phone.

354
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,230
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"

355
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:04,860
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

356
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,287
Not too short back there.

357
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,831
I have done this before, you know.

358
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,350
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

359
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,352
With clippers, usually.

360
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,909
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

361
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,327
We can't do this.

362
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:39,538
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

363
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,581
No.

364
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,084
I can't.

365
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,631
I can't get too excited.

366
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,386
Not even a little excited?

367
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,473
It's okay.

368
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,022
Sir, it's Blonsky.

369
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:10,444
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

370
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,904
Ask him yourself.

371
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,784
Sir?

372
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,975
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

373
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,192
How do you feel?

374
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:54,571
Pissed off and ready for round three.

375
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:04,956
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

376
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,876
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

377
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,922
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

378
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,925
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

379
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,218
-your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

380
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:19,930
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

381
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,307
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

382
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,559
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

383
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:28,563
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

384
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,444
Well, we could sell this.

385
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:38,115
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

386
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:43,036
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

387
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,622
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

388
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,958
plastic and Dr. Ross's web accounts,

389
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,293
and local PD have been placed on alert.

390
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:53,004
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

391
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,090
They're not gonna just pop up.

392
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:58,218
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

393
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,137
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

394
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,347
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.

395
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,557
He's not trying to escape this time.

396
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,143
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.

397
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,645
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.

398
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,564
You all have copies of the correspondence.

399
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,108
The aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue

400
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,318
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.

401
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,029
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

402
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:21,491
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

403
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:23,994
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

404
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,871
Hey.

405
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,041
Smile.

406
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:23,136
What is it like?

407
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,807
When it happens, what do you experience?

408
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,102
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

409
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:33,313
Those induced hallucinations?

410
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:37,484
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

411
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,240
It's like someone's poured
a liter of acid into my brain.

412
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:48,161
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

413
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:51,790
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

414
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,502
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

415
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:02,175
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

416
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,261
Maybe your mind is in there,

417
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,930
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

418
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:10,350
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

419
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,031
Are you ready?

420
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:26,866
Let's even the playing field a little.

421
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:31,579
Gentlemen.

422
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:39,212
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

423
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:53,351
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

424
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,452
All right. Come.

425
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:28,595
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

426
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:31,348
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

427
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:33,933
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

428
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:36,686
Right. Let's get a cab.

429
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:40,982
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

430
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,489
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

431
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:50,700
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

432
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,827
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

433
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,750
Are you out of your mind?

434
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,210
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

435
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,003
You don't like a good ride?

436
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,090
Asshole!

437
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,720
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

438
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:15,016
-manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

439
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:16,476
Okay.

440
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,944
Excuse me. Dr. Sterns?

441
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,613
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

442
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,533
Oh! Dr. Ross!

443
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,536
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

444
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,498
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

445
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,709
Mr. Green?

446
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:47,590
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

447
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,426
And if you were, what would it look like?

448
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:54,222
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

449
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:55,932
Nothing could have surprised me more

450
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,893
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

451
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:01,604
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

452
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,398
Even if everything goes perfectly,

453
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:07,360
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

454
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,238
is that going to be a lasting cure

455
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,700
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

456
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,412
I don't know.

457
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:22,876
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

458
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:28,715
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

459
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:33,386
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

460
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,140
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

461
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,810
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

462
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:43,354
this will be very dangerous for you.

463
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:49,152
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

464
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:53,531
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

465
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,213
How you feeling, man?

466
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,550
Like a monster.

467
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,196
Okay. On the table.

468
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:21,327
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

469
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,540
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

470
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:34,173
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

471
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:39,804
Okay...

472
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,973
You, you, you.

473
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,061
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

474
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,232
We have begun.

475
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:56,112
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

476
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,617
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

477
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,909
Just relax.

478
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:06,039
Okay. We are comprehensive.

479
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,668
Here you go.

480
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,722
All right. We set to pop?

481
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:27,352
I'd take your hands off him.

482
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,248
Oh, my God!

483
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,348
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

484
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,695
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

485
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,406
Now, do it! Do it!

486
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,416
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

487
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:36,003
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

488
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:41,467
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

489
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,096
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

490
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:05,908
Bruce.

491
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:07,368
Oh, my God.

492
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:21,758
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

493
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:27,013
Bruce?

494
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:39,192
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

495
01:19:42,612 --> 01:19:43,988
You did it.

496
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:46,783
He's fine. This is fantastic.

497
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,242
It's over.

498
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:50,244
Hi.

499
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:51,579
Hi.

500
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:06,010
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

501
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,637
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

502
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,139
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

503
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:13,976
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

504
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,812
- I think Dr. Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

505
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:19,148
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

506
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:22,068
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

507
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,862
Now, maybe we've neutralized
those cells permanently,

508
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,823
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

509
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,283
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

510
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,160
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

511
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:32,870
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

512
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:34,372
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

513
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,999
-the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

514
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,794
What test subjects?

515
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:41,587
Come with me.

516
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:02,650
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

517
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,819
We started on rats and mice,

518
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,488
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.

519
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:10,867
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

520
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:14,704
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

521
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:19,542
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

522
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,879
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

523
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:26,674
This is potentially Olympian!

524
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:30,261
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

525
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,388
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

526
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:35,600
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

527
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,490
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

528
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,784
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

529
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,244
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

530
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:57,580
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

531
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,248
We could get the Nobel for this!

532
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,542
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

533
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:04,253
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

534
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,422
At your discretion, shooter.

535
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:07,965
...three of us!
This is Promethean fire!

536
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:09,091
BRUCE ON RADIO.' ll"S just.

537
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:10,426
No Shot.

538
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:15,556
Blonsky's going in.

539
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:20,686
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!

540
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,315
We have the antidote now.

541
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,234
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

542
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,160
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

543
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,371
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

544
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,456
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

545
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,375
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

546
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,676
Bruce! Bruce!

547
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:54,595
Get out.

548
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,601
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

549
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,524
Show him to me.

550
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,276
Blonsky!

551
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,869
Miss!

552
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:21,747
Take this.

553
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:29,922
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

554
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:36,887
Betty.

555
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:41,809
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

556
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,227
He's a fugitive.

557
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,271
You made him a fugitive

558
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,858
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

559
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,486
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

560
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:58,284
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

561
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,373
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

562
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:09,211
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

563
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:12,631
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

564
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:16,594
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

565
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,637
So Banner's the only...

566
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:26,812
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

567
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:34,320
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

568
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,156
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

569
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,534
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

570
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:48,125
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

571
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:53,047
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

572
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,007
I have.

573
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,510
And it's beautiful.

574
01:24:58,344 --> 01:24:59,553
Godlike.

575
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,514
Well, I want that.

576
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,726
I need that. Make me that.

577
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:09,605
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

578
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,315
The mix could be

579
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:13,442
an abomination.

580
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,990
I didn't say I was unwilling.

581
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:24,245
I just need informed consent.

582
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:28,541
And you've given it.

583
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,919
This is what I was trying to explain.

584
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:18,924
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

585
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:21,093
But clearly it worked.

586
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:24,805
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

587
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:29,727
but if you'll just get back on the table,

588
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,313
I can fix this.

589
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:48,954
Shoot it!
Hey!

590
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:50,706
No!

591
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:02,509
Delta 4 to Leader.

592
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:04,261
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

593
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:07,056
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

594
01:27:09,934 --> 01:27:12,228
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

595
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:21,820
It's over there!

596
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,740
Drop them!

597
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,076
- What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

598
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,339
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

599
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:41,757
- Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

600
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,801
Something big
just went off down here!

601
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:46,428
General, you should hear this!

602
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:49,431
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

603
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,103
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

604
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,146
You get it together. What is your position?

605
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:59,483
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

606
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:01,151
Turn us around.

607
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:11,287
We're going back. Why are we going back?

608
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,038
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

609
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,707
Yes, sir!

610
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:18,669
What the hell was that?

611
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:20,587
Go, go, go!

612
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:45,404
No!

613
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:03,047
One of yours?

614
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:06,342
Oh, my God. What have you done?

615
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,512
Fire at him, fire at him!

616
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,935
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

617
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,604
Come on!

618
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,275
Sweet.

619
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,446
Booyah!

620
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:46,799
Get out of there, soldier!

621
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,720
Stacy!

622
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:24,336
Give me a real fight!

623
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:33,554
Sir?

624
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:37,224
Sir?

625
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:41,895
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

626
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,735
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

627
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,654
What are you saying?

628
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,072
You think you can control it?

629
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:55,284
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

630
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:56,869
And what if you can't?

631
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,122
We made this thing.

632
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:01,999
All of us.

633
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,209
Please.

634
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,633
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

635
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:14,553
Open the back door.

636
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:25,189
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

637
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:29,026
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

638
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:34,198
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

639
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:36,074
Betty, I've got to try.

640
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,578
I'm sorry.

641
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,852
Oh, shit!

642
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:10,692
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

643
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,170
There. Betty!

644
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:50,816
Hulk!

645
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,322
Yeah!

646
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:42,826
Come on!

647
01:34:15,067 --> 01:34:16,985
Is that all you've got?

648
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:33,502
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

649
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:34,836
Which one?

650
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,255
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

651
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,216
Cut the other one in half!

652
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:43,011
Ross!

653
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:09,579
Keep it on him!

654
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:40,736
- Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

655
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:49,095
Dad?

656
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:54,226
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

657
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:04,486
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

658
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:58,415
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

659
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,759
Look out!

660
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:22,874
General?

661
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:31,716
Any last words?

662
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:37,889
Hulk smash!

663
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,063
Stop!

664
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:49,145
It's okay.

665
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:00,907
Betty.

666
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:30,265
Reload.

667
01:44:37,814 --> 01:44:39,023
Reload.

668
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,209
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

669
01:44:58,293 --> 01:45:00,044
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

670
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:04,549
but that Super Soldier program
was put on ice for a reason.

671
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:07,552
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

672
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:10,013
- Stark.
- General.

673
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:14,851
You always wear such nice suits.

674
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:17,145
Touché.

675
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:21,774
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

676
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,359
You should listen.

677
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:29,532
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

678
01:45:29,615 --> 01:45:31,200
Who's "we"?
