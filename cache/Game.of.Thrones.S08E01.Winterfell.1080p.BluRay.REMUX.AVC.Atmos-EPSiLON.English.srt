488
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,455
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

489
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,666
No, no.

490
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,586
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

491
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,964
I'm not his brother.

492
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,717
He trusts you more than anyone.

493
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,511
Now's the time.

498
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,718
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

499
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,098
Were you hiding from me?

500
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:21,224
Of course not.

501
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,977
What are you doing in Winterfell?

502
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,938
Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

503
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,568
What's wrong?

504
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,029
Gilly? Is she all right?

505
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,072
- She's good.
- Little Sam?

506
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,825
Don't you know?

507
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,453
Know what?

508
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:43,830
Daenerys...

509
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,375
she executed my father and brother.

510
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,294
They were her prisoners.

511
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,091
She didn't tell you.

512
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,519
I'm so sorry.

513
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,565
We need to end this war.

514
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,401
Would you have done it?

515
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,948
Well, I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

516
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,075
You've also spared men.

517
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,452
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

518
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,120
I wasn't a king.

519
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,499
But you were.

520
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,627
You've always been.

521
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,130
I gave up my crown, Sam.

522
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,759
I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.

523
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,302
I'm not talking about
the King in the North.

524

I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

525
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,481
Bran and I worked it out.

526
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,568
I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had...

527
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,362
whatever Bran has.

528
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,655
What are you talking about?

529
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,535
Your mother...

530
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:05,996
was Lyanna Stark.

You've never been a bastard.

536

You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

537
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,561
I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

538
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,157
My father was the most honorable man
I ever met.

539
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,704
You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

540

No.

541
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,585
Your father... Well, Ned Stark.

542
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,630
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

543
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,633
And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

544
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,178
You're the true king.

- It's the truth.

His army's between us and Winterfell.
We're on foot.

We rode down from Castle Black.

We can double up on the horses.

we'll get there before the dead.
