1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,585
<i>Previously on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow
<i>and</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,837
Kuasa is my granddaughter.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,651
<i>Darhk and his daughter
are just too powerful.</i>

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,236
They have magic
that we don't understand.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,362
John Constantine.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,636
What? You never seen magic before?

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,093
<i>The last time we met,
I saved your soul.</i>

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,927
Now there's a demon out there,
possessing a little girl.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,261
<i>He knows your name.</i>

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,805
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,899
Who's there?

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,771
<i>I am Mallus.</i>

13
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,758
Sir?

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,129
Visiting hours are over.

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,428
You never saw me,
and, uh, everything is perfectly normal.

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,313
Perfectly normal.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,030
Emily.

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,490
Hey, sweetheart.

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,946
It's me again.

20
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,412
It's John.

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,081
I didn't think you'd find me
after they locked me up in here.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,787
His voice, it's so loud.

23
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,751
He says I can't fight him.

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,629
Well, let's prove
the nasty git wrong, shall we?

25
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,165
Come on, let's get you up.

26
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,891
All right, love,
this, uh, might sting a bit.

27
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,072
Go back to the place
from whence thou come.

28
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,412
I cast thee out!

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,126
You cannot save
this one, Constantine.

30
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:13,920
You've already failed her
just as you failed Astra.

31
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,185
This vessel is mine.

32
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,732
Even now, her soul
slips into the dark

33
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,146
to be joined by another.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,856
A friend of yours,

35
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,486
Sara Lance.

36
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,778
Sara.

37
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,610
How do you know Sara?

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,997
Tell me.

39
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,957
Tell me!

40
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,084
Sir!

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,534
I don't know how you got in here,

42
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,792
but I've contacted the authorities
and will press charges.

43
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,257
<i>All right, love.</i>

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,795
I can explain.

46
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,372
Don't get your pearls in a twist.

47
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,129
If you'll just look
at this here coin.

48
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,005
I will do nothing of the...

49
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,517
Sara Lance.

50
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,732
What the bloody hell
have you gotten yourself into?

51
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,573
We'll get to your demon,
but how did you even find me?

52
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,454
A simple matter.
I tuned a dowsing dagger

53
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,786
to your specific energy.
I followed it from there.

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,503
And I thought time travel was weird.

55
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,376
Well, you are not wrong
about that, love.

56
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,718
Blimey!

57
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,302
Ooh, this is one hell of a jam jar
you got here.

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,390
I thought we gave the Englishman
to the time pigs.

59
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,589
That was Rip.

60
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,595
This is John Constantine.

61
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,143
Skinny Brit in a trench coat,
same thing.

62
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,186
Oh, doubtful, mate.

63
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,601
You see, I'm an accomplished warlock,

64
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,651
an expert of the occult
and a master of exorcism.

65
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm also a Taurus
for those of you taking notes.

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,825
The Anansi Totem.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
That belongs to...

68
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,204
Her granddaughter.

69
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,576
Same totem, different Vixen.
She's from 1942.

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,248
You were saying
about the warlock thing.

71
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,291
Accomplished warlock, mate.

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,834
Well, I am charmed to know another
who bears the family name.

73
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,335
It's an honor.

74
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,797
So, what's your story then, handsome?

75
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,467
I'm from another Earth,
and I'm spoken for.

76
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,929
Yeah, his girlfriend's a guy.

77
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,976
Anyway, this is too much for me.

78
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,561
I'm going to watch TV.

79
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,392
I've nearly finished assembling
our new nanite pistol.

80
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,006
Soon, it's going to be,
"Look out, Darhks."

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,030
One blast of this baby,

82
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,731
and Damien's going to wish
he'd never come back from the dead.

83
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,452
Well, that is,
once the code's finished.

84
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,869
It's not a race, Ray.

85
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,992
No, of course not,
we're all winners here.

86
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,542
Just, you know, some winners
are faster than other winners.

87
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,272
This code will replicate
the combustive effects

88
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,754
of a heat and cold gun
crossing streams, using nanotech,

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,048
the only thing
that's made him flinch so far.

90
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,298
You really want to rush me?

91
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,676
No, no, no.

92
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,711
Besides, the last explosion
in this lab

93
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,718
caused a <i>Freaky Friday</i> Firestorm.

94
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,596
I miss them, too.

95
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,860
I broke into the loony bin
to perform an exorcism.

96
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,194
And while I was at it,
that demon called your name.

97
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,110
Said you'd soon
be slipping into the dark.

98
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,788
And I figured if Emily's demon
has you on a first-name basis,

99
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,241
you might know something
that can help me save you both.

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,910
I don't need saving.

101
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,038
And I am done fighting demons.

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,900
You think this has something to do
with the demon we're fighting?

103
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,335
I was speaking
of them metaphorically,

104
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,548
but, yes, I did recently visit
the spirit world. It's a long story,

105
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,601
but it's probably
how the demon knows my name,

106
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,433
and the demon's name is Mallus.

107
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,523
Mallus.

108
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,066
Smashing.

109
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,983
Very handy, demon names.

110
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,022
Just what I need
to cast this Mallus wanker out.

111
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,986
Now, I don't know what you
and your, uh,

112
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,067
dishy lot have gotten
yourselves into,

113
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,910
but I suggest you leave
it to the experts.

114
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,785
So, nice one for the tip,
I've got a girl to save.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,116
Oh, not so fast.

116
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,210
You said it yourself,
this is not just any demon,

117
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,788
and we've been fighting it
before you even knew its name.

118
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,359
And if this girl's
connected to Mallus,

119
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,295
she might be able
to help us destroy him.

120
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,510
You want to tag along
for an exorcism.

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,674
Yup.

122
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,426
That's out of the bloody question, love.

123
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,550
Well, we gave you its name,
so you owe us.

124
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,679
Well, I gave you your soul,
so you owe me indefinitely.

125
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,226
Hmm, all the more reason
for me to help you.

126
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,104
Nice.

127
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,114
If we're lucky,
Mallus hasn't cemented

128
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,739
his control over the girl yet.

129
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,477
Well, if you're looking for luck,
you're on the wrong Timeship.

130
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,748
How's about a light, then?

131
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,459
Ask Mick,
if you want your face burned off.

132
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,378
I'm doomed either way.

133
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,609
<i>We're receiving a transmission
from the Time Bureau.</i>

134
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,633
<i>It's Agent Sharpe.</i>

135
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,128
<i>Or should I call her Ava?</i>

136
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,256
Just put her on, Gideon.

137
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,969
Ava, hi.

138
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,714
Any progress with Rip?

139
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,924
Not yet.

140
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,600
I just wanted to let you know

141
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,414
that I'm still waiting
to meet with Director Bennett.

142
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,974
Unfortunately, no one here believes

143
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,057
that Rip was right
about Mallus being real.

144
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,980
I've even been barred from visiting
him while he is incarcerated.

145
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,693
It's a whole mess of red tape.

146
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,729
Well, if anyone can
get through it, it's you.

147
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,399
Thanks. I could use
a little encouragement.

148
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,076
Well, I think what we could both use
is a glass of wine.

149
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,328
Yeah.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,451
Uh, well, I'd better go.

151
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,158
So I will let you know
how things progress. Bye.

152
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,828
Aw.

153
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,006
What?

154
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,211
First, I apologize for interrupting.

155
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,836
Second, that woman
clearly has a crush on you.

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,216
Just don't.

157
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,306
Come, come, Captain.

158
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,508
She called you
for absolutely no reason.

159
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,343
It was just an excuse to talk to you.

160
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,518
Mmm-hmm.

161
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,143
Gideon, play back
that last bit please.

162
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,233
Gideon, don't.

163
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,317
Yeah.

164
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,985
Head down, eyes up,
cheeks flushed.

165
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,105
Classic courtship signals.

166
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,236
Even if it was, and it is not,

167
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,536
we're completely different people.

168
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,825
I don't know.
You're both strong women.

169
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,157
You're both obsessed
with repairing time.

170
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,334
You're both super hot.

171
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,999
Gay, not blind.

172
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,752
Look, Ava's the kind of girl that
you take home to your parents,

173
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,756
and I am the kind
you take to an exorcism.

174
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,062
All right, we've landed.

175
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,228
Where did they move her?

176
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,273
Can't find anyone named Emily
in the admissions record.

177
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,359
Guys, be careful.

178
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,980
You're in an asylum with a demon.

179
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,277
It's a twofer of terror.

180
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,151
Give her an additional
four milligrams of thiopental,

181
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,823
and prep her for another session.

182
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,076
That's her.

183
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,490
Oh, there she is.

184
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,909
Thank you. I can take it from here.

185
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,039
I mean, her from here.

186
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,617
I'm sorry. Who are you?

187
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,753
I'm Doctor...

188
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,499
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

189
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,926
Nice one, love.

190
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,698
I'll make sure no one else
gets in our way.

191
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,402
Find a place for her,
and we'll rendezvous.

192
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,641
All right.
Now, where to perform an exorcism?

193
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,266
There's a vacant room
in the east wing, room 237.

194
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,688
237. <i>Allons-y,</i> Alonso.

195
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,688
It's Kuasa. I'll hold her off.

196
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,071
Go.

197
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,452
I don't want to fight you.
I just want to talk.

198
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,158
There is no time for talk.

199
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,086
I must protect the moment
she became his.

200
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Emily.

201
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,551
Emily, I need you to speak to me.

202
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,847
That's not my name.

203
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,185
Uh, guys,
that girl you're trying to save

204
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,652
<i>is Nora friggin' Darhk.</i>

205
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,449
This is Damien Darhk's daughter?

206
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,656
How's that even possible?

207
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,869
<i>They changed her name.</i>

208
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,076
Looks like after Darhk
was killed by the Green Arrow,

209
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,161
Nora was placed
in Child Protective Services.

210
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,788
Demons prey on
the most vulnerable of souls.

211
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,800
This one, she lost her name,
her family.

212
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,884
Okay, so if we exorcise Mallus,

213
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,091
we could stop the family business
before it takes off?

214
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,972
We need her alert for an exorcism.

215
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,182
Nora, Nora, love.

216
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,560
Oh, they've got her knocked out cold.

217
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,366
You guys go hit up the pharmacy,
see if you can find some adrenaline.

218
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,025
Screw it.

219
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,629
I'm going to help Amaya.
You get the drugs.

220
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,645
Nate, take it.

221
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,567
- How do I use it?
- You pull the trigger.

222
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,739
Leo, we really need...

223
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,192
Yes, drugs, pronto. On it.

224
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,286
Nice one.

225
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,238
Oh, and, uh, see if you can
find me a light, yeah?

226
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,373
Got it.

227
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,041
What?

228
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,382
Huh. That is a sensitive trigger.

229
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,806
Nate, don't.

230
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,850
What did you do to her?

231
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,552
She was going to kill you, Amaya.

232
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,211
Let's get your granddaughter
back on the ship

233
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,351
before she thaws out.

234
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,524
I got the adrenaline,
and what is this?

235
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,200
It's the Triangle of Solomon

236
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,869
with some elder runes
and Enochian script.

237
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,913
It's a trap of my own design.

238
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,081
Mallus will have no chance
of breaking free.

239
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,687
Now, I've got to warn you both,

240
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,249
things are about to get
a little bit wonky in here.

241
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,623
Anything with an electrical current,
you might want to turn it off.

242
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,507
Guys, we're going dark.

243
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,210
Good luck.

244
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,011
Give her a nudge, love.

245
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,602
Who are you? Where am I?

246
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,692
It's okay.

247
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,984
All right? You're safe.

248
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,030
Now, you told John here
that you heard voices in your head.

249
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,073
Can you tell us
what they were saying?

250
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,073
"Six.

251
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,662
- "Six."
- "Six."

252
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,909
It's the number of the beast.

253
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,991
Now, step aside, Lance.

254
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,293
It's okay.

255
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,300
I summon the demon Mallus.

256
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,215
I order you to come forth.

257
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,051
Step into the light.

258
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,572
- Nora...
- No, no.

259
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,776
That's not Nora.

260
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,828
I've been expecting you, Sara Lance.

261
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:15,084
Soon, you will gaze
upon my true face.

262
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,379
Soon you will inhabit my world.

263
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,458
Mallus, you tosspot.

264
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,677
I see you.

265
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,556
No, John.

266
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,226
Your tricks won't work on me.

267
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,356
Bloody hell!

268
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,406
Any ideas?

269
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,400
That was all my ideas.

270
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,072
She's preparing an incantation.

271
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,365
Maybe we should stop her.

272
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,712
Emily?

273
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,673
Emily, are you all right?

274
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,931
They were trying to help me,

275
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,556
but now he has them.

276
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,358
So where are we exactly?

277
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,570
Well, I think the question is "When?"

278
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,620
January 16th, 1969.

279
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,326
She sent us back in time.

280
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,962
Wait, is that Nora's doctor?

281
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,837
Apparently, her taste
in jewelry never changed.

282
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,112
Yeah, this is all a bit weird.

283
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,877
Could we get your team
to come pick us up?

284
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,719
We can't communicate across time
without special equipment.

285
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,474
You mean we're stuck here.

286
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,564
Well, we wouldn't want
to stand out now, would we?

287
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,403
Bollocks!

288
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,030
Look.

289
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,652
They still have the same paintings
on the walls.

290
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,449
That's how we send our message.

291
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,680
The picture of the Blessed Virgin
that fell off the wall

292
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,821
when Nora was possessed

293
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,290
would still be hanging now in 1969.

294
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,978
If we write the message
on the back of the painting,

295
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,868
then the Legends
will find it in 2017.

296
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,956
Sure, as long as no one redecorates
for the next 50 years.

297
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,298
Fingers crossed.

298
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,532
Mick, have you heard from Sara
or the rest of the team?

299
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,741
They're not answering on comms.

300
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,381
Well, that explains the peace and quiet.

301
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,137
It's fine. She's my granddaughter.

302
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,287
Yeah, well, tell that to your arm.

303
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,973
You two, take it outside.

304
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,472
It's week 16 of the division titles.

305
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,148
You know we're on a Timeship, right?

306
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,392
Hey, Gideon, who won the...

307
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,485
No!

308
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,020
I haven't watched a live game
of football in three years.

309
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,446
I do not want to know the score.

310
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,943
Sara, it's Ray. Do you copy?

311
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,276
Z, would you please tell her
talking to Kuasa is a bad idea?

312
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,619
- No.
- Thank you.

313
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,573
I refuse to accept
that my granddaughter is pure evil.

314
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,700
Fine, she's 89% evil.

315
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,667
Guys, I think Sara is in trouble.

316
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,753
Quiet!

317
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,753
Haircut, take the new girl.

318
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,627
Find Blondie, Fake Snart,
and Trenchcoat.

319
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,046
Amaya, the MedBay. Pretty, the library.

320
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,260
Water Bitch stays in the freezer.

321
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,372
You know, Mick, you're really showing
some management potential.

322
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,396
Get out.

323
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,693
You ready?

324
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,337
Bet you wish you'd finished
coding the gun we've been working on.

325
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,887
If you don't shut up about that gun,

326
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,777
that demon's going to be
the least of your...

327
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,403
Whoa!

328
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,331
Nate, we haven't found Sara
or the rest of the team,

329
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,079
but we did find a strange symbol.

330
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,209
<i>What's it look like?</i>

331
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,916
Well, it's like a circle
with a line above the circle,

332
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,623
and then there's like a "U" shape
coming off of the circle.

333
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,425
A duck?

334
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,050
Welcome back to the 21st century,
you Luddites.

335
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,298
<i>Incoming message from Ms. Tomaz.</i>

336
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,934
- What's it mean?
<i>- It's an ancient runic symbol</i>

337
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,807
<i>used by practitioners
of the dark arts</i>

338
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,263
<i>for temporal manipulation.</i>

339
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,357
Oh, no.

340
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,851
Guys, I think Sara and co.
Got sucked into the timeline.

341
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,047
Gideon and I are
going to do some research

342
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,031
to figure out where they're
going to get spit out.

343
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,907
Or we can just ask her.

344
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,994
She is the one who cast the spell.

345
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,456
Hey, uh, don't touch the meatloaf.

346
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,874
You'll regret it, trust me.

347
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,719
This isn't my first time
in a place like this.

348
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,430
You know, I had this roommate once
who, um, thought I was her pet cat.

349
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,275
She would hide tuna fish
in my bed every night.

350
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,089
I don't know what was worse,

351
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,403
the smell or the fact that she
insisted on calling me "Slinky."

352
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,491
Friends of ours
came to see you last night.

353
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,201
They tried to help you.

354
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,954
- Where did you send them?
- I don't know.

355
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,711
It was the demon.

356
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,497
He took over.

357
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,708
And they won't be able
to stop him the next time.

358
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,758
And they'll lock me up
somewhere else,

359
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,301
put me on their drugs.

360
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,014
No. No, they won't.

361
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,850
We're going to get you out of here.

362
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,932
We can't take her out of here.

363
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,151
We're dealing with a...

364
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,652
D-E-M-O-N.

365
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,729
I'm not five.
I know how to spell "demon."

366
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,116
Places like this just make people
crazier and more vulnerable.

367
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,117
Isn't it best we keep an eye on her?

368
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,487
We can't take her on the ship.

369
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,495
No, not the ship, we need somewhere

370
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,198
sunny and boring.

371
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,915
Oh, that's your jam, right?

372
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,702
That... It is my jam.

373
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,412
We need to
give this girl a chance.

374
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,332
Who knows? Maybe she won't
grow up to hate us.

375
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,429
Clear.

376
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,220
<i>Sara.</i>

377
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,424
<i>Sara.</i>

378
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,676
<i>You're getting closer, Sara.</i>

379
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,136
Are you all right, love?

380
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,272
I'm fine. Come on.

381
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,098
We're almost at room 237.

382
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,486
<i>They can't reach you.
Only I can.</i>

383
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,826
<i>Sara.</i>

384
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,536
- Nora?
<i>- Help me, Sara.</i>

385
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,908
Nora?

386
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Is that you?

387
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,742
<i>Please, help.</i>

388
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,921
Captain Lance!

389
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,276
What is it? There's nothing there.

390
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
It's Mallus.

391
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,780
Well, I told you there'd
be repercussions

392
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,136
to going to the dark side.

393
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,258
It leaves a trace.

394
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,326
And now that he's sniffed you out,
he'll want to use you, too.

395
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,012
You can't let him break you.

396
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,371
- We've got to get out of here.
- All right.

397
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,395
Go.

398
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,143
The painting.

399
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,378
I'll put a message behind it.

400
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,064
I'll see to her
and come and find you.

401
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,815
- All right.
- You've got to help me.

402
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,314
- He's coming for me.
- All right, come on.

403
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,873
What do you think you're doing?

404
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:21,211
"Legends, we got dropped through time
from 2017

405
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,927
"and are now trapped in the past.

406
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,597
"The day is January 16th, 1969.

407
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,726
"Come quick."

408
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,015
So you are a time traveler?

409
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,806
Would you believe
I'm also from an alternate Earth?

410
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,731
Of course you are.

411
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,226
Take him to the operating room.

412
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,526
Hey, come here.

413
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,782
Stay with me. Stay with me.

414
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,035
- What's happening?
- It's Mallus' trickery.

415
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,284
Fear, anger. He's using
your darkest emotions

416
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,497
to prime you for possession.

417
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,128
He wants you to be afraid.

418
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,001
I need you to fight him, Sara.

419
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,935
Feels like the mother of
all hangovers, don't it?

420
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,855
Yeah.

421
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:23,113
A shot of pickle juice and a gin
and tonic will sort that right out.

422
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,862
I thought this was all over.

423
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,786
The bloodlust, the fight for my soul,
all the crap that I've had to endure.

424
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,118
Well, there's always
more crap to endure.

425
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,708
Take it from one who's

426
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,787
damned his own soul to hell.

427
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,833
There was a...

428
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,970
A girl in Newcastle.

429
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,131
Astra.

430
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,055
I failed her.

431
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,597
Some might say
you should forgive yourself.

432
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,607
Well, if I could,

433
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,611
then perhaps I wouldn't have the need
to save the likes of poor Nora.

434
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,317
What about you?

435
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,026
Have you forgiven yourself
for your sins?

436
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,245
I don't deserve forgiveness.

437
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,173
What is that?

438
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,805
It's a little reminder that

439
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,807
you are a survivor.

440
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:38,518
Strong enough to keep even
the most powerful demons at bay.

441
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,115
A laundry room
in a mental asylum in 1969

442
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,318
might not be the worst place
to be stuck.

443
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,241
Are we really this damaged?

444
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,335
I certainly hope so.

445
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,562
You must find the girl.

446
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,778
<i>She needs your protection.</i>

447
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,088
Are you okay?

448
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,755
What do you care, N <i>ana Baa?</i>

449
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,924
It's strange to be called "Grandmother."

450
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,467
If I've learned one thing,

451
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,011
it's that time travel
can be maddening.

452
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,304
I can imagine.

453
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,258
If you have the power
to change history,

454
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,014
and you choose to do nothing.

455
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,888
I choose to protect people
from those who would prey upon them.

456
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,809
And what about your own people?

457
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,794
If you really cared about them,

458
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,277
you'd take this ship
back to Zambezi, 1992.

459
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,443
I can't interfere with our fate.

460
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,984
Then you are a coward.

461
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,122
Yet you were a wonderful grandmother.

462
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,199
I adored you, Nana Baa.

463
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,331
I wanted to be just like you.

464
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,754
Then one night, the men came.

465
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,331
Please, I can't know this.

466
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,215
I watched the men murder you.

467
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,630
Then they burned our village
to the ground.

468
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,674
Mother ran with Mari.

469
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,559
She abandoned me.

470
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,271
No.

471
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,390
She thought you were dead.

472
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,357
I was alone

473
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,979
in a country ravaged by war.

474
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,065
I'm sorry, Kuasa.

475
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,066
I learned to embrace the pain,

476
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,787
using it to strike bargains
with powerful beings.

477
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,246
Like Damien Darhk?

478
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,373
What has he promised you?

479
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,992
Something you've refused.

480
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,583
A chance to protect our village.

481
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,752
A chance to save your life.

482
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,723
Chance to go anywhere,
and she chooses a coffee shop?

483
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,436
She just wants to feel normal.

484
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,268
Hey, you okay?

485
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,059
Hmm. Feels good to be in real clothes.

486
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,894
Yeah, tell me about it.

487
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,687
So, what are you going to order?

488
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,189
Oh, um...

489
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,732
Hot chocolate

490
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,740
with whipped cream and caramel sauce.

491
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,192
Uh, we just got her off her meds.

492
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,888
We really want to get her
hooked on sugar?

493
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,124
You know what?
I think I'll have a donut, too.

494
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,160
Nora, would you
find us a seat please?

495
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,330
Thank you.

496
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,860
We've really got to come up
with a plan

497
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,876
besides taking Mallus
to a coffee franchise.

498
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,052
Anything's better than
that insane asylum.

499
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,422
No, no, no.

500
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,347
No, you are making a serious mistake.

501
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm not insane, I promise.

502
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,393
You don't know what you're doing.

503
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,846
I've performed thousands
of trans-orbital lobotomies.

504
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,143
After we've finished,
your disease will be cured.

505
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,359
Who are you?

506
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,651
We're also from the future,

507
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,862
and spoiler alert, you don't age well.

508
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,778
They found the note.

509
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,989
And we need to find
another way out of here.

510
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,742
Okay, the symbol that Nora drew
was a time travel spell, right?

511
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,365
So why don't we just cast
the same spell and get out of here?

512
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,686
Yeah, she was channeling
the power of Mallus

513
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,710
when she cast that spell.

514
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,286
Not even I have that kind of juice.

515
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,463
I do. You said that Mallus can use me
the way that he does Nora,

516
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,461
so you summon Mallus into me.

517
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,713
I draw the rune same as her,
and we get to go home.

518
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,887
And what about
when the demon is inside you, eh?

519
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,533
You said I was strong enough
to hold Mallus off.

520
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,140
Yeah, well,
I was trying to seduce you.

521
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,139
Oh, please, I was seducing you.

522
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,831
I hope no one
was trying to seduce anyone

523
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,166
while I was about to be lobotomized.

524
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,978
You know,
this is why I like to work alone.

525
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,020
Okay, it's a musical.

526
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,980
Oh, this is an easy one.

527
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,274
No, no, not this again.

528
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,325
Ray, please don't sing.
Please, please.

529
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,241
<i>Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day</i>

530
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,710
<i>I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way</i>

531
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,503
That's okay, but I can't...

532
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,293
You guys know
this is a state, too, right?

533
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,465
Yeah.

534
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,671
Come on, my turn.

535
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,349
What? What is it?

536
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,228
<i>Mayor Queen is facing trial
for multiple murders,</i>

537
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,898
<i>including that of Damien Darhk
two years ago.</i>

538
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,438
- We should go.
- Yeah.

539
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,301
Hey, let's get out of here,
all right?

540
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,948
There's no place you can take me.

541
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,361
No place he won't find me.

542
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,622
- Hey.
- Nora.

543
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,415
Nora, we know you're still in there.

544
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,330
Hey, Nora, listen to us.

545
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,167
The girl is empty.

546
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,333
Long before you arrived,

547
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,168
she was mine!

548
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,554
You have to fight him, Nora.

549
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,767
She feels nothing.

550
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,528
She is nothing.

551
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,782
Hey, that's enough.

552
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,328
Everyone, get out.

553
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,086
Let her go.

554
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,795
Your fight's not with her.
It's with us.

555
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,252
There will be no fight.

556
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,057
We need backup. Nora's possessed.

557
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,426
Come on. Push back.

558
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,721
We're trying, but we need help.

559
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,602
Where's the defense?

560
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,944
That's what we're asking you for.

561
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,981
Oh, tie game. Third and... Goal.

562
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,195
- Here.
- Thanks.

563
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,162
Have you seen Amaya?

564
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,614
She's talking
to her granddaughter-sicle.

565
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,376
Wait, what?

566
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,202
You let her go in there?

567
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,332
Starting goal.

568
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,458
Damn it, Mick.

569
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,629
What do you mean,
you spoke to one of our ancestors?

570
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,711
She came to me in a vision

571
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,468
and told me to protect
the new totem-bearer.

572
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,050
I assumed she was talking about Zari.

573
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,266
But now...

574
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,269
I think she meant you.

575
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,313
You want to help me?

576
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,359
You're family.

577
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,918
Get away from her.

578
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,369
Put the gun down, Nathaniel.

579
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,965
Once you're under, don't let
the demon coax you in any further.

580
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,762
You must out-will Mallus

581
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,510
and draw the temporal rune.

582
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,306
Are you sure you want
to do this, love?

583
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,646
You want to stay here forever?

584
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,351
The ash of a slain phoenix

585
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,021
will hold Mallus
within his parameter.

586
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,196
And we'll hasten his wake-up call

587
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:33,781
by combining extract of hawkweed
with the saliva of a damned man,

588
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,125
which I'm sorry to say, love,

589
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,169
you'll have to ingest.

590
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,549
Let's summon this demon already.

591
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,386
All right.

592
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,057
Let him go.

593
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,266
It's working.

594
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,291
Somebody out there?

595
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,130
What's going on?

596
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Why did she stop?

597
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,839
Come on, Sara.

598
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,054
Finish it.

599
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,437
Nora?

600
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,430
He's possessing you, too.

601
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,432
I don't like what I'm doing up there.

602
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,272
I don't want to hurt them.

603
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,316
Hurt who?

604
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,653
Listen to me. You are not Mallus.

605
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,367
You are not a demon.
You are Nora Darhk.

606
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,392
You think you can fool me?

607
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,054
You're one of the six.

608
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
I'm what?

609
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,683
Nora!

610
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,479
Look at me. It's not your fault.

611
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,902
But now you get to make a choice.

612
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,195
You don't have to give in
to the darkness. You can fight it.

613
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,279
Nora, I know.

614
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,694
Because I fight it every day.

615
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,038
Can you do that, Nora?

616
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,119
Can you help me fight?

617
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,671
Hey, it's okay.

618
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,551
It's okay. It's over.

619
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,229
Anytime today would be good, love.

620
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,112
Come on!

621
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,242
- Are we leaving? We're leaving now?
- Grab her arm!

622
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,294
Are we back?

623
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,381
She bloody did it.

624
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,291
No, no, no.

625
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,509
No, no, don't do this to me.

626
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,962
Sara? Come on, Sara, come back to me.

627
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,431
Prove me wrong.

628
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:20,933
Oh, no.

629
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,599
You...

630
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,851
You should really
see your face right now.

631
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,191
Get up.

632
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,020
Kuasa, don't.

633
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,697
If you're going to kill me,
pull the trigger.

634
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,992
At least you'll have done something
to change my fate.

635
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,537
He can help me save you

636
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,705
so that I can go home.

637
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,128
Let him go.

638
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,586
You need him, too.

639
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,433
Don't disappoint me,

640
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,899
Nana Baa.

641
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,659
I...

642
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,573
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

643
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,406
Nora, look, we know that wasn't you.

644
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,583
You have to know that.
You have to believe that, too.

645
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,662
Hey, we're going to find you a home.

646
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,047
Somewhere where people
understand you.

647
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,711
Look no further.

648
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,045
I heard you guys were in town,
so I just had to stop by.

649
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,099
Daddy?

650
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,810
Hi, honey.

651
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,897
Nora, don't.

652
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,766
You're alive.

653
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,069
I missed you so much, Daddy.

654
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,192
Everyone's been so mean,

655
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,532
and every place I've gone
has been terrible,

656
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,325
but they kept me safe.

657
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,952
Your friends lied to you.

658
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,410
They're afraid of what you are.

659
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,709
You see, Mallus is no demon.

660
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,040
He's your savior.

661
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,247
Do you remember how he made you feel?

662
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,169
The power.

663
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,336
One day, you'll use that power
to bring me back to you.

664
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,133
You just have to accept him.

665
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,475
Nora, look, I know it's hard,
but don't listen to him.

666
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,010
Look, you still have a chance...

667
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,358
Come to me.

668
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,276
That's right, my darling.

669
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,730
Come to Daddy.

670
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,405
Now, we're going to have to part
for a little while,

671
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,616
but I know someone
who's going to give you a home,

672
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,870
a place where they
understand your power.

673
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,166
But...

674
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,959
The Order and I will help you
work with Mallus

675
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,216
so that you can bring
your father back for good.

676
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,267
Come on.

677
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,641
I know.

678
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,185
Family reunions can really suck.

679
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,081
God!

680
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,331
How many times
do I have to tell you? I'm fine.

681
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,914
Well, somehow you managed to channel
a demon of the highest order,

682
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,249
and you didn't succumb.

683
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,549
Sara's strong.

684
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,297
She's the strongest person I know.

685
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,713
Hey, when Nora
was possessed by Mallus,

686
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,548
he seemed scared of my totem.

687
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,100
He said that I was "one of the six."

688
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,554
And that bastard doesn't fear much.

689
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,015
If your totem gave him the frights,

690
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,767
maybe these trinkets are the keys
to stopping him.

691
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,148
So much
for our anti-magic nanite gun.

692
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,820
I only know about five totems.

693
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,819
There's my spirit, your air,

694
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,492
Kuasa's water, and then there's earth
and there's fire.

695
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,739
But could there be more?

696
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,996
I'll do some digging.

697
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,531
I have numerous contacts
I can draw on.

698
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,913
Well, this has been, uh, weird.

699
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,669
Even for me.

700
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,913
Well, I'll be on my way, then.

701
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,882
Hey, before you go, I, um...

702
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,347
I just wanted to say thank you.

703
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,759
For helping me with Mallus, that is.

704
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,270
Oh.

705
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,472
Of course. Uh...

706
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,817
Helping you with Mallus
was, uh, good for me, too.

707
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,945
If you ever need me to help you
with Mallus again,

708
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,401
just give us a call.

709
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,735
I'll be right there.

710
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,825
Although there are
lots of people out there

711
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:55,077
with very weird demons,
and they all need my help.

712
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,748
Mmm. I understand.

713
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Good.

714
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,501
And thanks for the shag, too.

715
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,703
That was great.

716
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,839
Oh, Ray, big man, do us a favor.
Uh...

717
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,148
Give us a hand
with the cargo door, will you?

718
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,636
It's actually
a pretty intuitive design mechanism.

719
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,472
Basic open-close functionality.

720
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,640
I know how to open
the damn door, mate.

721
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,848
Now, what's this
about an anti-magic gun?

722
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,892
Oh, I was going to put it in storage.

723
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,152
Don't.

724
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,523
You keep it nearby.

725
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
You said so yourself,

726
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,697
the key to stopping Mallus
are the totems.

727
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,783
That could be.

728
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,198
But in the meantime, you may need
a more accessible solution

729
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,122
for a more familiar target.

730
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,578
Sara may not know it,
but the demon's power,

731
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,954
it lives inside of her.

732
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,420
If, or more like
when, she succumbs to it,

733
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,005
you're going to need that gun.

734
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,544
<i>As always,
this is a non-smoking aircraft.</i>

735
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,131
Don't worry, Gideon, sweetheart.

736
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,724
I'll see you around, squire.

737
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,767
That guy's cool.

738
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,631
<i>The highlight so far,
there was the interception...</i>

739
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,029
Hello, friend.

740
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,529
Would you mind, uh, turning that off
for a second?

741
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,737
Off.

742
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,997
Okay. Um...

743
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,041
Just wanted to say I'm grateful.

744
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,378
Grateful I was allowed to tag along
with you and the Legends. It was...

745
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,625
It was an experience
and, uh, an education.

746
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,052
Likewise.

747
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,177
I'm proud to know you and...

748
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,973
This is hard.

749
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,887
This is me saying goodbye.

750
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,228
Take care of yourself, Mick.

751
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,485
You, too.

752
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,151
You know he's still
watching TV, right?

753
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,861
I wasn't watching...

754
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,946
Just a little bit.

755
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,075
On that note, Captain Lance,
I'm going home.

756
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,285
I'm going to ask Ray to marry me.

757
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,989
- Ray?
- My Ray, not your Ray.

758
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,040
Wow, that is a bold move.

759
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,534
It is.

760
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,128
Just feels like it's time
to sign up for a...

761
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,750
A different kind of adventure?

762
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,794
A different kind of adventure.

763
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,884
Exactly.

764
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,261
Snart.

765
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,175
I mean, Leo.

766
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,138
See you around.

767
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,553
I'll see you around.

768
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,519
Gideon, can you get me
a line on Ava, please?

769
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,651
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

770
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,273
<i>Would you like some privacy as well?</i>

771
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,067
Cheeky bot.

772
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,365
Captain Lance,
I was just about to call you.

773
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,031
Really? I mean... Cool.

774
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,030
'Cause, uh, I just wanted
to compare notes.

775
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,519
And I thought that maybe
if you'd like to come to the ship...

776
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:44,543
There's no time.

777
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,786
I finally got through
the Bureau's red tape,

778
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,538
and it seems Director Hunter
has escaped.

779
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,216
What?

780
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,625
Well, where is he?

781
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,927
We have no idea.
