ITS LESSON.

A POWERFUL WEAPON.

YEAH, AND THE TRIAD
COULD ALREADY HAVE IT.

THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY
NEED FOR DR. WONG.

472

AND A COMING CRISIS?

775
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,149
I DOUBT
THE CRESCENT ORDER

776
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,901
WILL HAVE
THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK.

777
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,654
THANKFULLY, THERE ARE
ORGANIZATIONS ON THIS EARTH

778
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,076
FAR, FAR OLDER
THAN THE CRESCENT ORDER.

779
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,786
I'M GOING
TO NANDA PARBAT.

780
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,594
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
WHAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN ON EARTH-2.

781
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,519
JOHN WAS THERE.
HE COULD HAVE
BEEN KILLED.

782
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,481
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THAT EARTH WAS
A NECESSARY SACRIFICE.

783
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,817
AND WHAT ABOUT
LAUREL LANCE?

784
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,693
HER FRIENDS,
HER FAMILY...

785
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,946
COUNTLESS MORE LIKE THEM
WILL PERISH

786
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,324
IF WE DO NOT ENSURE THAT
OLIVER QUEEN IS PREPARED

787
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,410
FOR WHAT IS COMING.

788
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,412
WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?

789
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:41,874
YES. I HAVE DR. WONG.

790
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,418
THEN LET US PROCEED.

791
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,236
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
