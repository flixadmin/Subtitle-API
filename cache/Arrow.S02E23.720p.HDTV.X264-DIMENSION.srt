1
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:02,412
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,642
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,766
Slade Wilson.

4
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:10,452
Oliver Queen.

5
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:13,787
Let me show you
how I'm going to die.

6
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,458
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,767
Sorry.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,135
For what?

9
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,604
For not telling you
how I really feel.

10
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,377
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

11
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,945
No! No!

12
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:40,781
No!

13
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,984
Whoever did this to her

14
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:45,786
is going to suffer.

15
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:49,590
You cannot die
until you have known...

16
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,126
Complete despair.

17
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:55,129
And you will.
I promise.

18
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:58,198
A new player
we've been tracking.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,269
We've been calling him
Deathstroke.

20
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,306
Slade's goal is to create
in the Mirakuru.

21
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,644
I can't stop him
from doing anything.

22
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:13,480
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

23
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,982
I'm here to fulfill it.

24
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:21,655
There is still one person
who has to die

25
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,257
before this can end.

26
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:29,196
Oliver.

27
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:32,066
Oliver, man, you ok?

28
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,571
The cure's not working.

29
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,807
We don't know that.

30
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,376
He still has a lot of Tibetan pit viper
venom in his system.

31
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:44,979
What's that?

32
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,513
Proximity alarm.

33
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,315
I rigged the tower
with sensors

34
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,451
just in case Slade's
goons came here to kill us.

35
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,355
Slade's goons
are here to kill us.

36
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,259
Talk to me, Felicity.
They're inside,

37
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,294
they're right
underneath us.

38
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:03,864
Where am I?

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,141
They're inside, there's
too many of them!

40
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:16,677
Felicity!

41
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,580
Down the cable!

Oh, my God!

45
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,607
What the hell
happened?

46
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,843
Slade's army. You were right about
this place being compromised.

47
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,978
Lyla, your boss is going to bomb
the city at dawn.

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,280
Yeah, Waller's never
seen a problem she didn't think

49
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,182
couldn't be solved
with a drone strike.

50
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,417
Why do you think I'm here?
You knew Waller was

51
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,786
looking to level the city and you
came here anyway?

52
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:35,155
You're here.

53
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,124
You need to go back
to A.R.G.U.S.

54
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,426
You need to stop Waller
or buy us enough time to stop Slade.

55
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,596
Not without me.
Till death do us part, right?

56
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,631
This time it might.

57
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,768
Guys? I need you to scrounge
as many weapons as you can find,

58
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,737
especially
injection arrows.

59
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,639
We're going to fill them with the cure--
which clearly works--

60
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:56,110
and this ends tonight,
without killing.

61
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:59,179
There's been enough
death already.

62
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,585
No!

63
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:33,945
Thea.

64
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,426
It's called Kevlar.

65
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:48,441
If you're going
to kill me, just...

66
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:49,909
Get it over with.

67
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,911
Kill you? Why?
Because you shot me?

68
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,479
I'm glad you did.

69
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,114
You're sick.

70
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:56,749
Perhaps.

71
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,818
How else to explain
the fact that not a year ago,

72
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,720
your brother held a gun to
my face as well.

73
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:02,788
Tommy?

74
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,458
He lacked conviction.
The strength to pull the trigger,

75
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,293
but not you, Thea.

76
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,662
You are made of iron.
You are truly my daughter,

77
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:12,598
and I could not
be more proud.

78
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,315
Remember your training.

79
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,886
You be smart,
you take clean shots,

80
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:24,808
and you don't miss the--

81
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:26,876
Fall
back to Meltzer Avenue.

82
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,944
We need SWAT at Union Plaza.
City hall's a crater.

83
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,181
They're--they're everywhere!

84
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,717
Fall back,
fall back, I'm hit!

85
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,158
Ok, listen,
I know you're scared.

86
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,060
You wouldn't be human
if you weren't.

87
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,662
But tonight,
this city, our city...

88
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,632
It's counting on each
and every one of you.

89
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:51,235
So you go out there
and you be the heroes

90
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,804
I know you all to be.

91
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,405
Go.

92
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,909
Where's your sister?

93
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,244
I don't know.
Detective.

94
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,880
I've got one-P-P
on the line.

95
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,583
Lieutenant Pike in the field,
you're the ranking officer.

96
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,718
You should go.
I'll find Sara.

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,621
Listen, I don't want you stepping foot
outside this precinct, you hear me?

98
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,491
I won't. I promise.
All right, sweetheart.

99
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,293
What do we got?

100
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,928
My sister can't be
a part of this.

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,796
I don't want her getting hurt.
Sara!

102
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,198
What's going on?
Laurel...

103
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,315
Well, it seems like
I missed a lot.

104
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,051
Well, what do you remember?

105
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,920
Leaving town
and heading to Blüdhaven.

106
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,623
Was I out cold
the whole time?

107
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,860
Felicity.

108
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,495
You were out.

109
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,630
The whole time.

110
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:58,000
Slade has at least 50 or
so of those human weapons.

111
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,503
We'll need a whole army if we plan
on hitting 'em with the cure.

112
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,739
I know.

113
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,943
Which is why an army
is what I've brought.

114
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,743
Gee, Sara, you could have
called before you invited...

115
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:23,147
5, 6, 7 assassins down
into our top secret lair.

116
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,082
What is she
doing here?

117
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,184
I asked her to come.

118
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,186
I'm Nyssa,
daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

119
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:30,821
Heir to the demon.

120
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:34,491
Felicity Smoak.
MIT class of '09.

121
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,360
This is where you
went? Nanda Parbat?

122
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:38,529
The League of Assassins?
These people are mercenaries, Sara.

123
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,699
Whatever they promised you,
it comes at a price.

124
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:44,468
You don't have to worry about it,
because I've already paid it.

125
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,638
You agreed
to go back.

126
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,575
Look, I'm not going to let Slade Wilson
hurt Laurel or my father.

127
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,110
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

128
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:55,112
to keep the ones
that I love safe,

129
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:58,315
and I hope you're ready
to do the same.

130
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,918
Especially after what happened.

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,288
Ollie, I'm sorry
about your mother.

132
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,725
I am willing to do
whatever it takes,

133
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,827
but that doesn't mean
cold-blooded killing

134
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,730
is the answer, Sara.
We have the cure now.

135
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,098
To fight the unthinkable,

136
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,302
you have to be willing
to do the unthinkable.

137
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,040
You may not want
my help, Mr. Queen,

138
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,342
but there's little question you are in
desperate need of it.

139
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:28,279
First we need to find
Slade's base of operations.

140
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,581
Slade Wilson
and Isabel Rochev are using

141
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,117
your former office
building as their base of operations.

142
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,123
How are you feeling?

143
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,492
Ready to serve up
some payback.

144
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:44,094
Then remember your training.

145
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,631
Remember everything
that you've learned.

146
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:55,539
Are--are you
for real?

147
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,642
Someone--a friend--

148
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:01,011
once told me that if you
survive a crucible,

149
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,680
you grow the stronger for it.

150
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:06,150
This is to remind you of that.

151
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,621
What happened to
Thea? Is she...Ok?

152
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:13,891
She's fine. She was
headed out of the city

153
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,492
before this started.

154
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,165
We do this my way.

155
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,499
The league does not
take prisoners.

156
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,501
It does tonight.

157
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:31,809
Thea, it's dangerous
out there.

158
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:34,478
Better than here
with my psycho-villain dad,

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,681
who's happy
I tried to kill him.

160
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,689
Roy?

161
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,124
Thea, it's--
it's me.

162
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:49,426
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

163
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:52,229
I'm fine.

164
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,898
I'm at the train station.
Thea, listen to me.

165
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,068
You're not safe there. Can you
please meet me at my place?

166
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:01,071
I'll be there.

167
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,840
Soon as I can.

168
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,943
Ok, be safe.

169
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,378
Who was that?

170
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,747
Roy?

171
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,733
You're my daughter. There's not
much I don't know about you.

172
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:15,786
Interesting how
you run back to him

173
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:19,623
after resolving to run away to
escape all the lies

174
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,426
and half-truths.
He's no different, Thea.

175
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:25,262
No different from
your mother or Oliver.

176
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:28,198
If you don't
believe me,

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,968
then you should
go to him.

178
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,537
I will.

179
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,374
And if you try to follow me,
I'll shoot you again.

180
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:42,179
When you need me,
I'll be there.

181
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:03,233
Elevator bank's clear.

182
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,138
Conference room's clear.

183
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,379
You must have
quite a bit

184
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,981
of faith in this cure
if you've come alone.

185
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,483
We didn't come alone.

186
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,243
Sara, don't!

187
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:51,849
Kill me.

188
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,217
Don't kill me.

189
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,352
It doesn't matter.

190
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:58,388
I beat you.
I took away the one--

191
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,003
Your reticence to do
what is necessary

192
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,171
is why your city burns.

193
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:11,638
This isn't working.

194
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,540
I can't get close enough to Slade to
hit him with the cure.

195
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:17,109
So what do we do?

196
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:26,258
Another
disappointment!

197
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:27,892
Bring me another!

198
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,994
Come on, Slade,
what are you doing?!

199
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:36,234
Advancing
the cause of science.

200
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,738
Wait, no, no, wait,
I know you blame me for Shado's death!

201
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,208
I blame myself!
He should!

202
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,011
It's his fault
we aren't together.

203
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,214
You said once
that we were brothers.

204
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,850
And right now,
I am begging you,

205
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:56,754
brother to brother,
just listen to me!

206
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,724
Don't listen to him!
All his words are lies.

207
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:03,227
I wouldn't be alive
right now if it wasn't for you.

208
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,929
I would be alive
if it wasn't for him.

209
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,032
Think about Shado!

210
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,735
She--she cared
for both of us.

211
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,403
She wouldn't
want this.

212
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,505
She wants us
off Lian Yu.

213
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,240
She'd want all
of this to end!

214
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:19,777
He's right!
This needs to end.

215
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,380
You need to kill him.

216
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,595
Two hours now.

217
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,636
Prosti menya, moy drug.

218
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,006
I'm sorry, Oliver.

219
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:58,483
Do it.

220
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:02,620
Slade, no!

221
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:03,988
Pull the trigger!

222
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,791
Slade!

223
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,529
Laurel! Laurel!

224
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,464
Sweetheart, sweetheart!

225
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,366
What--what happened?!

226
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,301
Sara!
She's gone, sweetie.

227
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,836
Oh, my God.
You ok?

228
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,005
She's with that woman!
The woman that took mom.

229
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,974
Please, no!

230
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,810
Stay right here.

231
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:31,516
Stop right there!
Don't take one more step.

232
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:34,152
One more step!

233
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,392
Slade Wilson
wants to see you.

234
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,493
No, no!

235
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,662
Drone's locked
on target.

236
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,964
Starling City.

237
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,491
Why does this
Wilson guy have such

238
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:56,130
a mad-on for the Queens?
I don't know.

239
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,166
Good thing Thea and Oliver got
out of town in time.

240
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,503
So they have to go
after my family?

241
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,030
What's she doing here?

242
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:06,000
She's here to help.

243
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:08,435
Just trust me,
please.

244
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,405
I guess today I'll have
to work with anybody

245
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:12,740
who can help get
my daughter back.

246
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:14,341
What?

247
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,143
One of these masked guys,
they took Laurel.

248
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:19,213
I--I couldn't stop them.

249
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,914
Believe me,
I-- I tried.

250
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,783
Oh, we have a new,
big problem.

251
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:25,152
Which, considering our other ones,
is really saying something.

252
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:28,856
I hacked a satellite and tasked it for
thermographic imaging--

253
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,958
all of Slade's men are gathering at
the Giordano Tunnel.

254
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,327
I thought these guys were trying
to destroy the city, not escape it.

255
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:34,528
A.R.G.U.S. is going
to level the city

256
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,797
to stop them
from getting out.

257
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,799
That's what Slade's planning on.
He knows Waller's tactics.

258
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,934
Fortunately,
with Slade's men

259
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:43,070
attempting to leave
via the tunnel,

260
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,938
all our targets will be grouped
in a single place.

261
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,907
We need to take it.
Gather your men.

262
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:49,777
What about Laurel?
Wilson took her for a reason.

263
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,245
I know what it is.

264
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:54,348
But the city
comes first.

265
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,985
This is my daughter.
This is your sister!

266
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:00,320
You can't just
leave her like this!

267
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:03,057
Look, I know you said

268
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:05,082
you were trying another
way, and I respect that.

269
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:08,062
But Slade Wilson? His men?
They're monsters.

270
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:11,098
And monsters, they need
to be destroyed.

271
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:15,269
You've killed
before.

272
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:19,139
Tonight, I suggest
you get back in the habit.

273
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,513
He's wrong.

274
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:31,117
He's right.

275
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:34,354
I've lost everything
because I'm fighting Slade Wilson

276
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,956
with one hand tied
behind my back.

277
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,460
The man murdered
my mother.

278
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:43,596
I have to kill him.

279
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,222
You told me you had
a choice.

280
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:47,235
That years ago, you could
have cured Slade

281
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,149
but you chose to kill him instead.

282
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,738
This isn't happening because
you're not willing to be a killer;

283
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:52,472
it's happening
because you were one.

284
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,608
You're right. That's
how this started.

285
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,978
It's how it has to end.

286
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,681
The only move that
he has left for me is to kill him.

287
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:02,349
I can't cure him,
I can't capture him,

288
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,917
I can't even
out-think him!

289
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,886
Then don't. Don't...

290
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,356
Just make him out-think you.

291
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,461
Residents are being urged
to stay in their homes

292
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,965
amidst unconfirmed rumors that
mayor Blood is among the casualties

293
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:21,401
as masked men
terrorize the city...

294
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:30,310
I'm sorry
for everything.

296
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,414
I...

297
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,283
No, it's ok.

298
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,385
I know--I know that
I haven't exactly

299
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,020
been myself
for the past few months.

300
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,955
I was injected with...

301
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:44,358
With some drug. I know.

302
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,226
Sin told me.

303
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:49,830
But are you ok now?

304
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:51,865
Yeah, I'm fine.

305
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,902
I woke up here. I lost
a lot of time, but...

306
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,871
And what about the Arrow?

307
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:02,309
He said he was going
to take care of you?

308
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,746
I don't know anything
about the Arrow.

309
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:09,783
I'm done with all
of that, but I...

310
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:14,554
You're the only person that I've
ever cared about.

311
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:26,900
Are you okay?
Did something happen to you?

312
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,669
It doesn't matter.

313
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,773
Look, let's just--
let's just get out of here.

314
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:36,510
Let's start over.
We can be whoever we want to

315
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,912
without anyone
getting in our way.

316
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,516
I'm never
losing you again.

317
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,760
Yeah, there's just--

318
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,532
there's just one thing
I need to take care of

319
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,566
before we go, ok?
So just stay here

320
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,301
and get some stuff
packed and I'll be right back.

321
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:04,404
No, Roy, it's dangerous.
I know.

322
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,506
But I have to do this.

323
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,775
I wouldn't feel
right if I left without trying.

324
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:12,069
Do you trust me?

325
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:15,582
Yes.

326
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,486
Then when I get back, we're getting
out of here forever.

327
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,756
I love you.

328
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,101
Oliver.

329
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:37,504
What are we doing here?
 The whole city's falling apart.

330
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,272
I know.

331
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,775
You need
to stay here.

332
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,543
What?!

333
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,779
Why? You can't just ask me to--
I'm not asking.

334
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,616
I will come and get you when
this is all over.

335
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,685
No!
Felicity...

336
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:52,786
No! Not unless you tell me why.

337
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:54,154
Because I need you
to be safe.

338
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,956
Well, I don't want to be safe.

339
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,024
I want to be with you.
And the others, unsafe!

340
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,160
I can't let
that happen.

341
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,362
Oliver.

342
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,431
You're not making any sense.

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,636
Slade took Laurel because he
wants to kill the woman I love.

344
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,937
I know, so?

345
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,706
So he took
the wrong woman.

346
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,010
Oh...

347
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,317
I love you.

348
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:32,159
Do you understand?

349
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,227
Yes.

350
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:55,829
Johnny.

351
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:57,598
Yeah?

352
00:20:58,304 --> 00:20:59,294
Never mind.

353
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:01,008
Hey, Lyla.

354
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,937
I love you.
You know that, right?

355
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:06,473
I do, actually.

356
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,476
But it's good
to hear it.

357
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,914
Time to impact?

358
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,383
Drone is 52 minutes
out from target.

359
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,419
Get me sergeant Gomez
at the Giordano Tunnel.

360
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:23,290
Easy company's not
responding, ma'am.

361
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:25,192
I need a visual.

362
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:27,327
They're in a tunnel,
ma'am, I can't get a picture.

363
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,564
What the hell is going on
in that tunnel?

364
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:34,034
Sergeant Gomez,
come in! Sergeant Gomez!

365
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,841
No kill shots.
Let the cure do its work.

366
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,445
Ready?

367
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,616
Ready?!

368
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:52,452
Ready, fire!

369
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,768
Agent Michaels, this area's restricted
to all unauthorized--

370
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,847
What the hell is this?
Early parole?

371
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,783
Waller's looking
to bomb Starling City.

372
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,618
We need your help
to stop her.

373
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,820
As much as I'd love to show
the Wall what we think of her,

374
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:28,588
there's just that little matter
of tick, tick, boom!

375
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,325
Ok? We've got all that
miniature bombs in our spines.

376
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:32,926
You have
to trust me.

377
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,796
And Lawton,
no dropping bodies.

378
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,465
Yeah, sure, take
the fun out of it.

379
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,201
Nyssa!

380
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:46,500
Get off the ship!

381
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:49,503
Not without you!

382
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:52,706
Give it to me!
Give me the Mirakuru!

383
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,308
No!

384
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:04,384
Ollie!

385
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,720
Sara!

386
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:39,352
Prep the drone to fire.

387
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,288
Weapons hot was set
for oh-six hundred.

388
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,056
Prep the drone to fire!

389
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,730
Down, now!

390
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:53,266
Everybody get
down, down, down!

391
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,769
Waller, call that drone off!

392
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:59,072
This is treason,
agent Michaels.

393
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:02,108
Treason that risks hundreds of
thousands of lives.

394
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,877
Have you thought
about that?

395
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,479
Have you thought
about how

396
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,047
you're going
to explain that to your son?

397
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,249
Or is it
your daughter?

398
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:10,818
Did doctors specify,

399
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,154
or did you want to
keep it a surprise?

400
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:20,594
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle,
you're going to be a father.

401
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:26,833
Go!

402
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,435
You've
been busy, kid.

403
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:32,339
It's over, Slade!
Your army is broken.

404
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:33,974
And I pity them.

405
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:38,178
But once again,
you miss the point.

406
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,548
I have the one you love.

407
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,219
You're going
to meet me where I say.

408
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,121
Otherwise,
I'm going to kill her.

409
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:51,558
No, you do what you have to.
I'm done playing your games!

410
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,793
You're done when
I say you're done!

411
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:56,530
I was surprised.

412
00:25:56,532 --> 00:25:58,798
I thought you had a thing
for stronger women,

413
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,667
but now that I've met her...

414
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,570
I can see the appeal.

415
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:07,389
She is quite lovely...

416
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,977
Your Felicity.

417
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,563
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

418
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,299
My first words to you.

419
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,536
Do you remember? I do.

420
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:40,471
I remember the exact moment.

421
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,140
My blade against your neck.

422
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:47,878
Just like my blade is against
the neck of your beloved.

423
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,647
If only I'd killed you then,

424
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,817
everything
would be different.

425
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,220
Drop the bow, kid.

426
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,026
Do it.

427
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:18,108
Yes.

428
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,710
Countless nights dreaming

429
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:23,547
of taking from you
all that you took from me.

430
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,550
By killing the woman I love?
Yes.

431
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:29,587
Like you love Shado.

432
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:32,356
Yes.

433
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:34,325
You see her.

434
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:37,061
Don't you?

435
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:40,865
Well, what does she look like
in your madness, Slade?

436
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,367
What does she say to you?

437
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,769
I remember her being beautiful.

438
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:48,472
Young. Kind.

439
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:51,709
She would be horrified

440
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,577
by what you've done
in her name.

441
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:57,381
What I have done?

442
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:58,916
What I have done

443
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:02,987
is what you lack
the courage to do!

444
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:05,155
To fight for her!

445
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:08,626
So...

446
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:11,562
When her body
lies at your feet,

447
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:15,032
her blood wet
against your skin,

448
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:19,169
then you will know
how I feel!

449
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,205
I already know how you feel.

450
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:24,675
I know what it's like to hate.

451
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:27,811
To want revenge.

452
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:31,148
And now I know how it feels

453
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,818
to see my enemy
so distracted,

454
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,522
he doesn't see the real danger
is right in front of him.

455
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:58,609
Do you understand?

456
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,545
Yes.

457
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:05,549
Kill her!

458
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,454
Get them out of here!

459
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:17,661
Poor Sara.

460
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:20,397
How many times
you going to watch her die?

461
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:46,290
You can't kill me.

462
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,204
The Mirakuru isn't
what made me hate you!

463
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:07,478
The end is near.

464
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,813
But maybe
I'll be merciful enough

465
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:14,184
to let you live
and see your city burn!

466
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,685
We both know
there's only one way

467
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:49,620
that this can end.

468
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:52,956
To beat me, kid,

469
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,858
you're going
to have to kill me.

470
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,095
But in the moment
of my death,

471
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:01,065
you'll prove one thing--

472
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,235
that you are
a murderer.

473
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,246
What are you going
to do, kid?

474
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:18,549
Stick me with the cure?

475
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:21,285
It doesn't matter.

476
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,021
I'll keep my promise!

477
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:26,457
I'll take away everything

478
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,559
and everyone you love!

479
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,128
Sara was only the first!

480
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,430
She was only the first!

481
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:36,166
Your sister,
Laurel, your mother!

482
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:22,513
You can kill me,
or not.

483
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:27,217
Either way, I win.

484
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:39,096
Amanda, it's over.

485
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:40,831
Slade's down,
his army's been taken out.

486
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,934
Call back the drones.

487
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:46,770
Amanda, it's over!

488
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:01,952
So what now, kid?

489
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:15,098
It's time.

490
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,001
Why--why are they
making you do this?

491
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:19,636
Why are you making her do
this, huh? Why?

492
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:22,572
Dad, she's not
making me do anything.

493
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:25,042
I chose this.

494
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,510
What am I going to
tell your mother?

495
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:30,113
Tell her that for the first time
in my life,

496
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,683
I'm deciding my own fate.

497
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:35,352
She'll understand that.

498
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,321
Yeah.

499
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:41,825
I love you,
sweetheart.

500
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,628
I love you, too, Dad.

501
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,531
I know the power
of a father's love,

502
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:50,901
and I would die before
I let anything happen to your daughter.

503
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:54,104
Well, here's hoping.

504
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:58,108
So, where
you're going,

505
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,110
will you be able
to email or call?

506
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:03,180
I'll see you again.
I know.

507
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:05,682
If there's anything that
I've learned this year,

508
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:07,484
it's that you always
find your way home.

509
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:10,220
And we'll always
be here waiting.

510
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:13,256
I love you.

511
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,960
I love you.

512
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:20,801
Oliver needs you.

513
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,374
And, hey...

514
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:32,112
I think that this would
look good on you.

515
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,528
It fits.

516
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:53,767
Bye, Dad.
Bye, sweetheart.

517
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,311
About that jacket...

518
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,313
Don't get any ideas.

519
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:13,120
I could really use a meeting.

520
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:16,356
Yeah, probably a good
idea for the both of us.

521
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,192
Listen, I got to pick up
a little pepto on the way, though,

522
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:19,726
'cause I'm feeling
kind of weird.

523
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:21,428
Dad, she'll be ok.

524
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,730
Yeah, I know she'll be ok,
but ok what is what bothers me.

525
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:26,099
Dad?

526
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,101
Dad!

527
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:30,938
Oh, my God. Dad!

528
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,673
Dad!

529
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:34,007
Oh, my God!

530
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,909
I can't get
my breath!

531
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,844
I can't...

532
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:43,050
Dad, stay with me!
Daddy, daddy, stay with me!

533
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,952
Hello?!

534
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,354
I need an ambulance.

535
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,890
My father's with SCPD. Yes, now!

536
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:53,060
Daddy, stay with me!

537
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,828
Thea.

538
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,464
Thea!

539
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:15,478
Roy...I'm sorry.

540
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,530
I made a mistake.

541
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:19,965
I thought I could
still be with you.

542
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,601
I thought I could
still be Thea Queen.

543
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:26,004
But Thea Queen was trusting.

544
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:27,773
And I don't trust you.

545
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:31,443
Or anyone. Not anymore.

546
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:33,111
Thea Queen was also weak.

547
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:36,648
And no matter what it takes,
I will be strong.

548
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,887
Don't try to find me.
You won't.

549
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:45,157
Even I don't know
where I'm going.

550
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,459
I only know one thing--

551
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:50,028
I am never coming back.

552
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:12,824
Where am I?

553
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:17,983
As far away from the world
as I could get you.

554
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:21,765
Where you can't hurt
anyone ever again.

555
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:25,068
That's your
weakness, kid.

556
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,105
You don't have
the guts to kill me.

557
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:32,776
No. I have the strength
to let you live.

558
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:35,912
Oh, you're a killer.

559
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:39,583
I know, I created you.

560
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:42,919
You've killed plenty.

561
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:45,188
Yes, I have.

562
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,093
You helped turn me
into a killer when I needed to be one.

563
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:53,563
And I'm alive today
because of you.

564
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:57,634
I made it home because of you.

565
00:37:57,636 --> 00:38:01,671
And I got to see
my family again.

566
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:08,945
But over the past year,
I've needed to be more...

567
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:11,815
And I faltered.

568
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,889
But then I stopped you.

569
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,490
Without killing.

570
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:35,875
You helped me become
a hero, Slade.

571
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,947
Thank you.

572
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:50,389
You think I won't
get out of here?

573
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:57,163
You think I won't
kill those you care for?

574
00:38:57,165 --> 00:39:00,673
No, I don't.
Because you're in purgatory.

575
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:08,808
I keep my promises, kid.

576
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,544
I keep my promises!

577
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:15,882
I keep my promises.

578
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:31,397
Last time I didn't notice;
It's actually kind of beautiful here.

579
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,798
Don't get me wrong,
I'm counting down the seconds

580
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,701
until we shove off
minefield island.

581
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:38,137
So you think
that'll be enough to hold him,

582
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,006
A.R.G.U.S.'
super Max?

583
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:41,941
Him, and anyone else
we send here.

584
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:45,411
This battle may be over,
but there will be others.

585
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,548
Starting with getting
my family's company back.

586
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,416
That's not going to be easy,
since you're poor now.

587
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:52,151
You're going to have
to get a job.

588
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:54,854
If Slade doesn't
scare you, that's got to.

589
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:56,399
Do you know anyone hiring
ex-billionaires

590
00:39:56,424 --> 00:39:58,368
with superior archery skills?

591
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:04,030
Hey, why
don't I, uh,

592
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:06,465
give you two
a second?

593
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:12,004
Well, you did it.

594
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:15,074
I had help.
Yeah.

595
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:16,576
That's really smart.

596
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:18,244
How you out-foxed him.

597
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:21,013
Talk about unthinkable.

598
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,516
You and me, I mean.

599
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:26,385
When you told me
you loved me,

600
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:28,955
you had me fooled.
For a second,

601
00:40:28,957 --> 00:40:30,289
I...

602
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,758
Maybe you might have meant it.

603
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,128
What you said.

604
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:39,532
You really sold it.

605
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,737
We both did.

606
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:50,243
Let's go home.

607
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:59,118
Dig, what was the news
about you and Lyla?

608
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,853
It can wait.

609
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:03,089
I'm flying.
Be my guest.

610
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,490
I got one more
question!

611
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,158
Wouldn't be you if you didn't.

612
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,793
If you spent
five years on this island,

613
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:10,496
when did you
learn how to fly a plane?

614
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:32,885
Gun ngo lei.

615
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:46,699
My name is Amanda
Waller, Mr. Queen.

616
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,302
We have a lot
to discuss.

617
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:58,110
Welcome to Hong Kong.
