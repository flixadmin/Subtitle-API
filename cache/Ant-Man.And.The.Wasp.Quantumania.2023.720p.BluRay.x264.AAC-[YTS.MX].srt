1
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,781
What is this place?

2
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,383
<i>My life doesn't really make sense.</i>

3
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,676
Hey.

4
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,554
<i>I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.</i>

5
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?</i>

6
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?</i>

7
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,519
<i>"That doesn't make sense. "</i>

8
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,939
<i>A lot has changed about my life.</i>

9
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.</i>

10
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,985
Can you take a picture with my dog?

11
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,529
<i>"Scott, what about now?</i>

12
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,738
<i>"What's next?</i>

13
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,323
<i>"Where does the ride take you?"</i>

14
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,201
<i>If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.</i>

15
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,369
All right.

16
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,957
<i>- It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
- Hey, hi. How are you?</i>

17
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,541
Everything is ready for you.

18
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,709
You're too much.

19
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,252
No, no, no.

20
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,504
Your money's no good here.

21
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,089
- Are we still talking about that?
- Yes, of course.

22
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,550
Rubin, you are the best.

23
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,261
Thank you, Spider-Man.

24
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,974
<i>So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.</i>

25
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,350
<i>Like friends.</i>

26
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:50,144
<i>Friends you didn't even know you had.</i>

27
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,232
<i>Remember the people who got you here.</i>

28
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,650
<i>You couldn't have done it without them.</i>

29
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,653
<i>Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

30
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,239
<i>Sometimes you just get lucky.</i>

31
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:04,366
<i>I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.</i>

32
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:05,910
<i>I think you know who she is.</i>

33
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,163
<i>She's taken back her dad's company.</i>

34
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,081
<i>Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.</i>

35
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,502
<i>A lot of people say they want
to save the world...</i>

36
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,462
<i>but Hope, she saves it every day.</i>

37
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,631
Thank you.

38
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:21,424
Thank you so much.

39
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:25,512
<i>Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.</i>

40
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,263
<i>She's not wasting a second.</i>

41
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,521
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

42
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:38,024
<i>None of this should have happened.</i>

43
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,192
<i>But it did.</i>

44
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,819
<i>It's a pretty good world.</i>

45
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:44,696
<i>I'm glad we saved it.</i>

46

All right, come on. Let's go.

67

Come on.

68
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,971
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

69
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,139
Not yet. No.

70
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,558
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

71
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,518
Cassie. What happened?

72
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:00,686
Sign here.

73
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,689
You know, just jail stuff.

74
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,482
Give it back.

75
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:07,902
I know it was you.

76
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,068
Are you sure?

77
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,445
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

78
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,489
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

79
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:14,408
Where is it?

80
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,618
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

81
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:21,789
I did find this though.

82
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,671
You shrank a cop car?

83
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:29,923
What were you thinking?

84
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,840
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

85
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,926
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

86
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,845
- No, I'm not saying that...
- And where do they expect them to go?

87
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,930
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

88
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,931
I know that.

89
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,017
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

90
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,268
I'm not telling you what to do.

91
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:44,728
- I'm just saying...
- Telling her what to do.

92
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,229
Telling me exactly what to do.

93
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:47,856
No, you do what you want.

94
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:49,650
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

95
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:50,984
Okay.

96
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,443
You know, I promised your mom...

97
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,071
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

98
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:56,239
It's really dangerous tech.

99
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,741
I know it's dangerous.

100
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,159
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

101
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,327
I didn't lose the suit.

102
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,328
You have a suit?

103
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:03,704
Wait, you have a suit?

104
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,248
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

105
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:07,290
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

106
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,502
Ouch.

107
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,548
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- I know.

108
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,006
That's okay. It's all right.

109
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,258
I get it.

110
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,970
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

111
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:20,930
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

112
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,973
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

113
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,600
I've never had a normal life.

114
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:28,395
How about some music?

115
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:31,064
<i>"And in that moment, all I could think was...</i>

116

117

<i>"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"</i>

119
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,821
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

120
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,366
<i>- "But I was ready for anything.
- Hmm? No, that's...</i>

122
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,743
- Dad, turn it off.
- It's so weird.

123
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,745
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

124
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:47,955
I said turn it off.

125
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,331
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

126
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:52,084

Thank you.

131
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,221
All right.

132
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,391
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

133
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:11,102
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

134
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,229
God, I admire you.

135
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:14,606
Thank you.

136
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:17,400
I missed this.

137
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,319
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

138
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,404
No. No anything.

139
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,824
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

140
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,367
If you want.

141
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,536
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

142
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,123
I wanna live right now.

143
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,379
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

144
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:41,631
Grandpa.

145
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,090
"This time"?

146
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:44,717
Was there a last time?

147
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:46,803
I mean, last time barely counts.

148
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,930
I didn't know that.

149
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:49,972
Why didn't you call me?

150
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,390
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

151
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,392
I would've just broken you out with ants.

152
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,894
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

153
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:56,063
Can we have a family meeting?

154
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,230
Isn't that what we're doing?

155
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:58,356
Yeah, I mean about this.

156
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,399
About everybody being so fine with this.

157
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,402
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

158
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,071
I do, Cassie. I really do.

159
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,490
But I don't want you wasting your life.

160
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,784
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,995
I literally saved the world.

162
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:14,996
Oh, did you?

163
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,873
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,667
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

165
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,001
How was that for you, Scott?

166
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,461
You should write a book about it.

167
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,046
Ha ha. Hilarious.

168
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,090
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

169
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,715
And what do you do now?

170
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:29,886
Sign books?

171
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,888
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

172
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:34,765
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

173
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,892
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

174
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,229
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

175
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,981
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

176
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,149
Not insane.

177
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,442
People still need help, Dad.

178
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,237
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

179
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:53,784
Who's "we"?

180
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:57,078
What are you three up to?

181
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:58,997
Science.

182
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,375
With ants.

183
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:04,544
Ant science.

184
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,088
I don't believe you.

185
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,299
Let's just show him.

186
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:15,805
What are they building?

187
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,097
Are you doing this?

188
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:20,475
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

189
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,103
Pretty smart ants.

190
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,021
Okay, so when you were all...

191
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,191
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

192
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,651
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

193
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:31,777
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

194
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:33,655
The Quantum Realm?

195
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:37,159
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

196
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:38,243
but we've been talking about it.

197
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,827
She had some questions, okay?

198
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,164
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

199
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,336
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

200
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,255
Why didn't you ask me about it?

201
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,507
I tried, Mom.

202
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:54,800
A lot.

203
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,636
You never wanted to talk about it.

204
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,054
Cassie's just been curious...

205
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,889
and we gave her some pointers.

206
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,683
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

207
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,854
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

208
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:07,854
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

209
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:09,564
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

210
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:11,566
That's why we made this.

211
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:15,110
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

212
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:19,199
But Quantum.

213
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,827
We just need a map.

214
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,413
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

215
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,334
Never even have to go.

216
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,380
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

217
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,844
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

218
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:44,180
then I could have found you.

219
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,686
It's amazing.

220
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:50,938
I'm blown away.

221
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:54,649
How does it work?

222
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:57,777
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

223
00:11:58,194 --> 00:11:59,863
You send a signal down from here...

224
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,990
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

225
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:03,116
Wait. Wait a minute.

226
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:07,077
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

227
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:09,789
Yeah.

228
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,167
- Shut it down now.
- Janet...

229
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,042
- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?

230
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,294
You have to turn it off!

231
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,004
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

232
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:21,758
Janet?

233
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:27,472
There's something I should have told...

234
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:02,672
Dad?

235
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:06,551
No!

236
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,220
- No!
- Mom!

237
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:10,138
No!

238
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,515
Damn it!

239
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:15,602
Dad?

240
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:48,925
Dad!

241
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,681
Dad!

242
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:21,874
Cassie.

243
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,421
Dad!

244
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,299
Oh, Dad. Come on.

245
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,508
Okay.

246
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:33,509
Are you okay?

247
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:34,802
Yeah. I'm okay.

248
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,278
Where are we?

249
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,378
Mom!

250
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,007
Dad!

251
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,883
Hope. Over here.

252
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:19,553
Are you okay?

253
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,972
We should be dead.

254
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:23,974
Why aren't we?

255
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,351
I don't know.

256
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,896
Are we where I think we are?

257
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,272
I would say yes...

258
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,775
but it wasn't like this.

259
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,152
Janet!

260
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,570
Mom!

261
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:38,696
Janet!

262
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,366
Mom!

263
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,587
Do not move.

264
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,648
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

265
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:17,860
Right now.

266
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,823
<i>Hope? Hope?</i>

267
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,908
<i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i>

268
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,495
<i>- Can anyone hear me?
- Oh, my God.</i>

269
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,039
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

270
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,1000
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

271
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,209
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

272
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,459
You're saying "okay" too much.

273
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:38,795
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

274
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:39,839
We're okay.

275
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,007
We are fine.

276
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,550
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

277
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,802
In the meantime, look around.

278
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,179
It's beautiful.

279
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:48,597
All right? We're outside.

280
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,475
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

281
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,809
We've never been camping.

282
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,645
But we've always talked about it.

283
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,194
Is that sun moving?

284
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,163
Get back!

285
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:19,792
Oh, my God.

286
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,378
I don't think this is a sun!

287
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,214
It's fine.

288
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,425
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

289
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:27,592
Still okay.

290
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:37,894
Dad. Oh, my God.

291
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,062
That was weird.

292
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:45,443
Run.

293
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,349
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

294
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,516
Yeah.

295
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,768
I didn't know that either.

296
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,273
What was that back there, Mom?

297
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,067
What was that ship looking for?

298
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:29,944
Keep your voice down.

299
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,196
You said there was nothing down here.

300
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,697
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

301
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,490
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

302
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,493
- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!

303
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,203
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

304
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,455
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

305
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,832
No, you need to tell us what's...

306
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,376
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

307
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,296
Janet, I'm so sorry.

308
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,757
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

309
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:53,925
I know. It's...

310
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,260
We'll talk later.

311
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,220
Right now, we stick together...

312
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,557
we find Scott and Cassie...

313
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,808
and we go home. Okay?

314
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,310
- Okay?
- Okay?

315
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,478
- Okay.
- Okay.

316
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
Stay close.

317
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,404
This is incredible.

318
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,406
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

319
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,952
Why didn't I see any of this?

320
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,496
You weren't able to look deep enough.

321
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,123
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

322
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,210
There are worlds here...

323
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,086
worlds within worlds.

324
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,841
It's a place outside time and space.

325
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,803
It's a secret universe...

326
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,764
beneath ours.

327
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,828
Hey, get your hands off me!

328
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:13,793
Cassie?

329
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:17,588
Where's my daughter?

330
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:20,758
Where is she?

331
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:22,843
Cassie?

332
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:27,807
Where's my daughter?

333
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:32,435
Cassie!

334
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:36,107
Dad!

335
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,941
Cassie!

336
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,068
Drink the ooze.

337
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:42,487
What?

338
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:05,800
I'll handle this.

339
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,065
Mom.

340
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,078
Was that a good stab?

341
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:18,995
I got us a ride.

342
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,349
He's friendly.

343
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,350
Quite a ride.

344
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,436
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

345
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:45,522
I like ants.

346
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:47,982
And I love that you love them. Here.

347
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:51,026
These will help us blend in.

348
00:22:51,777 --> 00:22:54,697
Where exactly are we going on this?

349
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,615
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

350
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:58,659
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

351
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:00,744
it'll be him.

352
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
After you.

353
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:05,748
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

354
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:13,214
Let me go! Let me go!

355
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:25,893
I don't know what you're saying!

356
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:27,895
I don't know what you...

357
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:47,789
No! No!

358
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,008
Drink the ooze!

359
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,510
Drink the ooze!

360
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,553
Drink the ooze!

361
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,055
Drink the ooze!

362
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:06,724
Hello.

363
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:07,808
Hi. Hi.

364
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:09,392
Did you drink the ooze?

365
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:12,355
Why can I understand you?

366
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:13,606
Great. That's the ooze.

367
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,649
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

368
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:20,779
We can finally be friends.

369
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:22,115
Hi. I am Veb.

370
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:23,240
You just drank me.

371
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,616
I did... What?

372
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:25,909
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

373
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,994
- I can pour some ooze into your hole...
- No, I'm okay.

374
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,703
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

375
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,288
A big hole.

376
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:33,125
How many holes do you have?

377
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,127
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

378
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:36,878
I don't have any holes.

379
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,088
His name is Scott Lang.

380
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,507
He has seven holes.

381
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:47,513
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,431
How did you know that?

383
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,599
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

384
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:54,979
You can read minds?

385
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:58,232
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

386
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,401
Everyone is disgusting.

387
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,239
- Could you please stop thinking that?
- Sorry.

388
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:07,615
- Please, stop.
- Thinking?

389
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,118
- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.

390
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:13,495
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

391
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,164
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

392
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,583
I wish my head glowed.

393
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:18,668
No, no, you don't.

394
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:21,253
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

395
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,296
What are you doing here?

396
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:24,381
- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.

397
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:25,507
We should torture him.

398
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:26,593
Guys. No, it's okay.

399
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,470
We're not spies. He's my dad.

400
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,015
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

401
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:37,143
Then who is San Francisco?

402
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,854
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

403
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:39,980
Then what's Earth?

404
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:40,981
It's also where we're from.

405
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,149
We should torture them.

406
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,442
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

407
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,403
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

408
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,031
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

409
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:51,240
Some of us have holes.

410
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:52,825
What are you doing here?

411
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:54,660
Where are you from?

412
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:56,621
- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.

413
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,749
- See, above this, it's a different universe.
- The Earth. Big Earth.

414
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,001
- It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
- This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

415
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:04,003
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

416
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,046
- And it's like...
- But I wrote a book about it, actually.

417
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,088
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

418
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:08,465
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

419
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,426
- We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
- It's bigger where we're from.

420
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:12,385
- So, we're small right now.
- It's bigger.

421
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:18,183
Okay, they're telling the truth.

422
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,225
It doesn't matter.

423
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:23,855
You come from above.

424
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,108
Like him.

425
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,236
So, he is hunting you.

426
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:33,532
He will burn the world to find you.

427
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:35,449
Who?

428
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:38,369
The Conqueror.

429
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,849
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

430
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:47,977
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

431
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:51,230
a subatomic universe.

432
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:53,857
This changes everything we know about life...

433
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:56,443
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

434
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,321
Holy shit!

435
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:00,364
That guy looks like broccoli.

436
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,082
Keep your head down.

437
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:04,217
Follow me.

438
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:18,647
Drink those.

439
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:20,691
I'll be right back.

440
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:36,330
I'm here for Krylar.

441
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:42,295
It's you.

442
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:43,795
Let's keep that between us.

443
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:46,424
And Krylar.

444
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:47,592
Hello.

445
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,552
I don't know your ways or customs...

446
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:54,264
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

447
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,474
Absolutely, sir.

448
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:00,854
So, what's your story then?

449
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:03,315
God.

450
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:05,858
Move.

451
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,277
It's time.

452
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:08,820
Follow me.

453
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:16,786
Right this way.

454
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,794
How exactly do you know this guy?

455
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,130
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

456
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:30,299
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

457
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:31,509
Or terrorist.

458
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:33,719
Depends on who you ask.

459
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:37,263
But, trust me, he can help.

460
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:21,889
Janet Van Dyne?

461
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,435
I thought you were dead.

462
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,937
Been a long time, Krylar.

463
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:31,357
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

464
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:33,860
I fought like hell against that.

465
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:36,028
It sounds so elitist.

466
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:39,948
You have got to be Hank.

467
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:43,870
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

468
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,205
What are ants anyway?

469
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,747
Do we have 'em down here?

470
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:49,541
I don't think so. No.

471
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,710
That's too bad.

472
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:53,920
Hope.

473
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,339
You have to be Hope.

474
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,134
She talked about you every day.

475
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:00,635
That's strange...

476
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,970
she never said anything about you.

477
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:07,601
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

478
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:10,102
- Wild stuff.
- Funny.

479
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:11,771
How wild?

480
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:15,357
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

481
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:20,029
Krylar, we need your help.

482
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:24,157
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

483
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,408
just ask me.

484
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,077
Tell me, how can I help?

485
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:28,537
But...

486
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,748
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

487
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,041
Boys...

488
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,793
Now.

489
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,177
They don't know anything.

490
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:47,429
About... anything.

491
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:48,598
Then get them out of here.

492
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:51,601
Excuse me.

493
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,894
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

494
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:55,437
We're just trying to find our family.

495
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:56,730
Do you have a map?

496
00:32:56,897 --> 00:32:58,148
All we wanna do is go...

497
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:02,194
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

498
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,487
They're with us.

499
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:06,782
Is that building alive?

500
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:08,533
Yours are dead?

501
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,038
Look. Excuse me.

502
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:14,705
We just wanna go home.

503
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:20,963
At least you still have a home.

504
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,262
What happened here?

505
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:33,558
The Conqueror burned our homes.

506
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:35,977
Our stories.

507
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:40,230
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

508
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:42,900
Some of us escaped...

509
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:44,818
found others on the run.

510
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,446
We gathered who we could to fight.

511
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:49,698
It was never enough.

512
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:52,199
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,077
We can help.

514
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:02,084
- Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.

515
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,169
They need help.

516
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,255
No. What I need to do is get you home.

517
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:06,881
Why don't you wanna help?

518
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,257
We don't know anything about this place.

519
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,133
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

520
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:11,469
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

521
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:12,635
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

522
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:13,928
Think about your mom right now.

523
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,265
- Can you imagine what she must be...
- Don't use Mom as an excuse.

524
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,517
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

525
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,351
I know you wanna help. I do.

526
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,312
But this is not our fight.

527
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:25,356
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

528
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:27,859
Hey.

529
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,197
Would you look at me?

530
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:35,992
She's disappointed in you.

531
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,619
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

532
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:38,620
You're welcome.

533
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,871
We'll talk about it later.

534
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,706
Right now, let's just find the others.

535
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,124
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

536
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,420
What did you say?

537
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,005
What?

538
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,380
That name.

539
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,050
Janet Van Dyne.

540
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,176
Where is she?

541
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,095
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

542
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,805
I know her.

543
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,390
She shouldn't be here.

544
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,143
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

545
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,853
Yes, thank you.

546
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,108
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

547
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,692
unless you want to change your life.

548
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,498
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

549
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:28,750
Two of them.

550
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,211
Human, like us.

551
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,004
Human, that's the word.

552
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,257
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

553
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,425
Human.

554
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:39,094
Are you not human?

555
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,263
Not technically, but yes.

556
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:43,265
In the ways that matter.

557
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:48,894
No!

558
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,775
Let us talk.

559
00:35:56,735 --> 00:36:00,990
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

560
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,827
If I remember correctly, you left.

561
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:08,289
You left all of us.

562
00:36:08,956 --> 00:36:10,165
With him.

563
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,669
Janet, what is he talking about?

564
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:18,465
You didn't tell them about him.

565
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,011
Did you say anything...

566
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,138
about what you did here?

567
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:29,642
How many people died because of you?

568
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:37,066
Does your family even know who you are?

569
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:41,904
Your mommy...

570
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,200
is full of secrets.

571
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,450
You're lying.

572
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:47,743
I lie.

573
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,079
A lot.

574
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:54,499
Not about this.

575
00:36:56,293 --> 00:36:57,586
Let them go.

576
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,380
He just wants me.

577
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:02,924
But you want them.

578
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,885
So they're coming too.

579
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:10,181
Along with those other friends of yours.

580
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:13,434
I heard about them.

581
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,811
But he did too.

582
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:19,232
And he sent the Hunter.

583
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,400
What kind of hunter?

584
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:24,778
Not a man. Not a machine.

585
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:28,825
A mechanized organism designed only...

586
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,700
for killing.

587
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:34,121
Where are they?

588
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,580
No clue.

589
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:37,832
Dead.

590
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:41,420
Probably dead.

591
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,935
This is so sad when all of this...

592
00:37:58,102 --> 00:37:59,644
could have been avoided, Janet.

593
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:02,940
Just give him what he wants.

594
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,610
What happened to you?

595
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,409
We fought against him.

596
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,370
He can be very persuasive.

597
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,957
Let's pay him a visit.

598
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,421
I think we're done here.

599
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:45,647
Can that ship get us out of here?

600
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,109
Cover me?

601
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:50,359
Always.

602
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,391
Henry, take the helm.

603
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

604
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:31,274
Where are the controls?

605
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:33,068
Those are the controls.

606
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:37,906
What the hell?

607
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:39,950
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

608
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:44,286
Is the bike alive?

609
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,510
Hands, all the way in!

610
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:01,637
Like stuffing a turkey.

611
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:11,729
- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.

612
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:12,647
That guy?

613
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:14,649
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

614
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:16,526
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

615
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:18,485
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

616
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:19,653
Oh, my God!

617
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,906
I had dinner with someone a few times.

618
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,950
Her name was Linda.

619
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:25,909
It didn't work out.

620
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,327
What went wrong?

621
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:29,371
She wasn't you, baby.

622
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,669
- Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
- All right.

623
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,629
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

624
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:40,006
Take them as far away from here as you can.

625
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,215
- Why?
- What?

626
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:44,553
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

627
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,771
You led them straight to us.

628
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:56,647
Come on, come on.

629
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:58,733
Take as many as you can.

630
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,109
We'll hold them off.

631
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:24,340
Go!

632
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,385
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

633
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,513
We gotta go! We gotta go!

634
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,721
Get on. Get on now!

635
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,139
We have to go now. Now!

636
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,117
Oh, my God!

637
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:10,218
Cassie, let's go!

638
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,725
Get to the sanctuary.

639
00:42:19,477 --> 00:42:20,562
Wait for my message.

640
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:22,980
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

641
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:25,190
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

642
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:48,588
<i>Give up the travelers.</i>

643
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,047
<i>The Conqueror will show you mercy.</i>

644
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:51,591
I know his mercy.

645
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,313
Stay here. I'm...

646
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:08,565
Cassie?

647
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:11,276
Oh, no.

648
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:35,925
Okay. I have a suit.

649
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:37,843
Yeah, I noticed.

650
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:39,887
- You okay?
- Yes.

651
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:42,889
Look, momentum, right?

652
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:44,974
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

653
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:46,227
I know how to do it, Dad.

654
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:47,395
- Do you? Really?
- Yes.

655
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:48,729
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

656
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:50,188
I messed up on the timing.

657
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,189
Jump...

658
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,695
Like that.

659
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,280
You see what I did? You see what I did?

660
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:01,491
No. You're like this small.

661
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:02,867
I jumped and tapped.

662
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:15,087
Jentorra, we have to go.

663
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,442
Get to the ship!

664
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:28,074
<i>Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i>

665
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:31,409
<i>I've been waiting a long time for this.</i>

666
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:33,204
What?

667
00:45:34,747 --> 00:45:35,915
Is someone in there?

668
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:38,042
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

669
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:40,794
<i>The destiny you cannot escape.</i>

670
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,090
<i>Our fates have always been forged together...</i>

671
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,259
<i>ever since that day we met.</i>

672
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,097
Scott Lang.

673
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,347
Get away from us!

674
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:55,058
<i>The day you broke me.</i>

675
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:00,105
<i>- Banished me down here.
- Wait.</i>

676
00:46:02,439 --> 00:46:03,440
Darren?

677
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:06,736
Surprised to see me?

678
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:09,738
Yeah.

679
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,031
It's the bee guy?

680
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,242
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

681
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,076
I almost didn't recognize you.

682
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:17,621
How are you not dead?

683
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,706
I became the ultimate weapon.

684
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,042
That's what this is?

685
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:25,169
Look, Darren.

686
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:30,591
Darren is dead!

687
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:34,262
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

688
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,432
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

689
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:38,725
Not from me.

690
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,977
And not from him.

691
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,187
He's the future.

692
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,064
He's the past.

693
00:46:46,815 --> 00:46:50,111
And now all he needs is you.

694
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:57,534
Mom?

695
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:59,703
What's after Scott and Cassie?

696
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,039
We have to find them.

697
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,834
There's something I have to do first.

698
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,418
They could be dead!

699
00:47:07,585 --> 00:47:09,044
Hope, please.

700
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:10,839
And you're still hiding things from us.

701
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:13,299
I am trying to protect you.

702
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:14,884
From what?

703
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:19,388
Who are you so afraid of?

704
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:33,319
Third time in jail?

705
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:36,488
Four.

706
00:47:45,288 --> 00:47:47,290
<i>And here we are again.</i>

707
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,917
Face to face.

708
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:53,922
That's a face.

709
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,549
It's a big face.

710
00:47:56,716 --> 00:47:58,300
Why are you just a floating head?

711
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,552
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

712
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,640
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

713
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,267
<i>But the Conqueror found me.</i>

714
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:08,977
<i>Rebuilt me.</i>

715
00:48:09,144 --> 00:48:11,188
<i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i>

716
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:14,650
<i>A mechanized organism designed
only for...</i>

717
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:15,818
M.O.D.O.K.?

718
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:20,238
I get it. It's an acronym.

719
00:48:20,405 --> 00:48:21,572
It's an acronym.

720
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:24,742
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

721
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:27,787
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

722
00:48:27,954 --> 00:48:31,374
- I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
- Just now noticing the baby legs.

723
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,126
They're not baby legs.

724
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:34,668
A little bit like a Björn.

725
00:48:34,835 --> 00:48:36,170
You think you're so smart.

726
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:39,465
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

727
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,049
Who stole my whole life.

728
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:42,342
But I did it.

729
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:45,470
I got you here.

730
00:48:45,637 --> 00:48:47,640
I found your signal, Cassie.

731
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:50,392
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

732
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:55,646
You're looking at a man set free.

733
00:48:56,647 --> 00:49:00,318
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

734
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:04,113
All for him.

735
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:09,953
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

736
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,040
What is this place?

737
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,209
<i>He said he was a traveler.</i>

738
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,422
A scientist who crashed off course.

739
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:30,598
<i>He had a ship...</i>

740
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:34,142
beyond anything I had ever seen.

741
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:37,854
<i>A ship that could travel the Multiverse.</i>

742
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,229
The Multiverse?

743
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,776
As in alternate dimensions?

744
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:44,778
Parallel realities?

745
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,570
I didn't believe it at first.

746
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:49,782
But it's real.

747
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:52,994
<i>Just like we theorized.</i>

748
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,247
Can this take us home?

749
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,626
It can take you anywhere.

750
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,687
<i>I'd never met anyone like him.</i>

751
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:26,192
<i>He felt so...</i>

752
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:27,693
<i>lost.</i>

753
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:30,612
<i>I guess we both were.</i>

754
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,948
<i>But we had a way out.</i>

755
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,328
<i>We tried everything...</i>

756
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:40,288
<i>to recharge his ship's energy core.</i>

757
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,462
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

758
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:53,676
<i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i>

759
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,388
I lied to Hope.

760
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,601
I told her I was coming home.

761
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,607
I can see her by the door.

762
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,528
Waiting for me.

763
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,075
That's the last thing I did...

764
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:21,911
was lie to her.

765
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,751
I just thought I'd have more time.

766
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,049
I can give that to you.

767
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,051
Time.

768
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,307
It's not what you think it is.

769
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:48,020
It's a cage.

770
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,190
And it does everything it can...

771
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:52,941
to break you.

772
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:59,405
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

773
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:01,992
just how small...

774
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:04,203
it always was.

775
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:11,877
We're going to get out of here.

776
00:52:15,129 --> 00:52:16,631
She's gonna open the door...

777
00:52:18,216 --> 00:52:19,674
and you'll be there.

778
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:25,473
I promise.

779
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,895
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

780
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:37,943
<i>It took ages, but we did it.</i>

781
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:41,904
We brought it back to life.

782
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:45,534
Let's go home.

783
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,956
<i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i>

784
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:54,584
<i>Connected to his thoughts.</i>

785
00:52:58,504 --> 00:52:59,588
<i>When I touched it...</i>

786
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:03,425
I saw his mind.

787
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,553
<i>I felt...</i>

788
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:08,723
<i>what he had done.</i>

789
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:14,352
<i>Entire worlds...</i>

790
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:17,231
<i>entire timelines.</i>

791
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:21,401
<i>Gone, like they never even existed.</i>

792
00:53:39,835 --> 00:53:40,836
Janet?

793
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:46,842
We can leave.

794
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:50,054
Right now.

795
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:56,684
Who is Kang?

796
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:03,441
Who I need to be.

797
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:09,112
He didn't crash here.

798
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:11,324
He was exiled here.

799
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:15,578
Outside space and time.

800
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,413
The only place...

801
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:20,958
that could hold him.

802
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:23,461
Exiled?

803
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,587
By who?

804
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:26,963
I don't know.

805
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,258
But they sabotaged his ship.

806
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:34,304
And trapped him here.

807
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:38,140
And because of me...

808
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:40,935
he was getting out.

809
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:41,936
Janet?

810
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,273
Stay away.

811
00:54:51,904 --> 00:54:53,572
You saved my life.

812
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:00,245
I made a promise.

813
00:55:07,211 --> 00:55:08,837
Just let me take you home.

814
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,673
And then?

815
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:15,593
What are you going to do?

816
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,273
Win.

817
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:50,044
I told you time isn't what you think.

818
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,838
I can make it...

819
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,716
so you never left her.

820
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:01,262
Hope is going to open the door...

821
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,015
and you'll be there.

822
00:56:05,016 --> 00:56:07,350
And how many worlds will die...

823
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:10,438
if you get out?

824
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:13,023
Not yours.

825
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:16,401
She'll never know.

826
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:23,700
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

827
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:27,578
I can't let you leave.

828
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,042
Why do you think you can stop me?

829
00:56:50,016 --> 00:56:51,394
Give it to me, Janet.

830
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:53,979
Give it to me!

831
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:57,399
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

832
00:56:58,274 --> 00:56:59,275
What did you do?

833
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:05,281
I'm sorry, Hope.

834
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,827
No!

835
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,771
<i>I blew up his core.</i>

836
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,149
<i>Cut him off from time.</i>

837
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:43,484
<i>And trapped us both down here forever.</i>

838
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:47,448
But I gave him back enough.

839
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:49,240
Now that he had his suit back...

840
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:52,785
he became what he always was.

841
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,370
<i>A conqueror.</i>

842
00:57:55,537 --> 00:57:58,124
<i>He's got weapons and technology...</i>

843
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,961
<i>centuries beyond anything we can dream of.</i>

844
00:58:02,794 --> 00:58:06,590
<i>He took his prison and made it his empire.</i>

845
00:58:07,633 --> 00:58:10,886
I spent years fighting him...

846
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:13,638
running from him, hiding from him.

847
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:16,767
And then you saved me.

848
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:21,104
You brought me home.

849
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:24,066
But I didn't deserve it.

850
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:29,446
I unleashed a monster on this place...

851
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:31,448
and ran away.

852
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:35,284
Janet, you couldn't have known.

853
00:58:37,453 --> 00:58:39,413
I'm sorry I never told you.

854
00:58:40,498 --> 00:58:42,375
I just wanted to forget.

855
00:58:43,876 --> 00:58:46,211
I just wanted to be your mom again.

856
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:54,552
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

857
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:58,139
But you are not alone now.

858
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,228
We'll stop him together.

859
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,730
He's after the core.

860
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:09,233
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

861
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,779
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

862
00:59:12,946 --> 00:59:14,781
- And a head start.
- Exactly.

863
00:59:14,948 --> 00:59:16,573
- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.

864
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:18,742
He cannot get out.

865
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:41,764
You're an interesting man...

866
00:59:45,435 --> 00:59:46,853
Scott Lang.

867
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:49,731
I don't know who you are...

868
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:52,691
but you've made a big mistake.

869
00:59:53,316 --> 00:59:54,359
Okay?

870
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:56,821
I'm an Avenger.

871
00:59:57,655 --> 00:59:59,031
I've called the other Avengers...

872
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:00,741
You're an Avenger?

873
01:00:03,035 --> 01:00:04,911
Have I killed you before?

874
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:06,872
What?

875
01:00:07,706 --> 01:00:09,624
They all blur together after a while.

876
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:13,503
You're not the one with the hammer?

877
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:15,004
No, that's Thor.

878
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:17,966
We get confused a lot.

879
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:20,343
Similar body types.
Who are you?

880
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:23,888
Just a man...

881
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,557
who's lost a lot of time.

882
01:00:26,725 --> 01:00:27,893
Like you.

883
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:32,271
But we can help each other with that.

884
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,274
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

885
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:38,736
Yeah, he stole something from me.

886
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:42,740
Do not speak when I am in the room.

887
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:53,124
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

888
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,168
You know Janet too?

889
01:00:56,461 --> 01:00:58,629
Does everyone down here know Janet?

890
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,549
She didn't tell you about me?

891
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:07,805
I guess that's not a surprise.

892
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,518
Janet stole something from me.

893
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:16,063
My ticket out of here.

894
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:21,694
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

895
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,612
And why would I do that?

896
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:26,281
Because you want to get out of here.

897
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:31,035
And I need to get out of here.

898
01:01:33,372 --> 01:01:35,206
Because I know how it ends.

899
01:01:35,665 --> 01:01:37,083
How what ends?

900
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:41,795
All of it.

901
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:48,344
I don't live in a straight line.

902
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,639
And with time...

903
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,726
it's hard...

904
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,893
not to skip to the end.

905
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:00,856
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

906
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,900
and trust me...

907
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:05,318
you do...

908
01:02:07,612 --> 01:02:09,740
I am the only shot you have.

909
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:11,574
What's coming?

910
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:14,703
Me.

911
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:19,248
A lot of me.

912
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:27,256
They exiled me, down here.

913
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:32,177
They're afraid of me.

914
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:41,353
But I'm the man who can get you home.

915
01:02:51,738 --> 01:02:53,239
So, do we have a deal?

916
01:02:56,617 --> 01:02:58,536
No, I don't think we do.

917
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:08,879
Dad!

918
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,340
Let me make this easy for you.

919
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:13,217
You will bring me what I need...

920
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:15,678
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

921
01:03:15,844 --> 01:03:17,929
then make you relive that moment...

922
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:21,392
over and over again in time, endlessly...

923
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:24,018
until you beg me to kill you.

924
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,688
Do we understand?

925
01:03:30,442 --> 01:03:31,442
Don't do this.

926
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:37,490
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

927
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:41,744
Dad.

928
01:03:42,912 --> 01:03:43,871
Don't listen to him.

929
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:47,499
No! No!

930
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,709
Look, we can talk about this.

931
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:50,293
Don't do it!

932
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,921
You really should do it.

933
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:53,088
Please.

934
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,967
That's my daughter, please.

935
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:59,594
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

936
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,761
Please!

937
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,180
You think I'm lying?

938
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,017
Do I look like a liar to you?

939
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:07,768
Stop!

940
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,437
- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

941
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,147
I'll do it. Just let her go.

942
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:12,858
Let her go. Let her go!

943
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:25,036
You're out of your league.

944
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:28,080
Ant-Man.

945
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:36,129
Just be glad I need you.

946
01:04:49,392 --> 01:04:52,811
Don't touch her again.

947
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,855
Then give me what I need.

948
01:04:56,608 --> 01:04:57,859
Where is it?

949
01:05:39,399 --> 01:05:40,817
What is that?

950
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:43,360
It was a multiversal engine core.

951
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,490
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

952
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:51,827
Then Janet blew it up.

953
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,498
It's in that?

954
01:05:57,665 --> 01:05:59,542
It is that.

955
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:01,753
And we have to get to the center.

956
01:06:02,587 --> 01:06:04,005
That's good to know.

957
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,051
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

958
01:06:09,218 --> 01:06:11,846
Once you're inside, find the core...

959
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,723
and size it back down.

960
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:15,349
What does it look like?

961
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:17,727
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

962
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:19,519
You'll know it when you see it.

963
01:06:19,686 --> 01:06:21,980
Get in and out as fast as you can.

964
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:25,443
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

965
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,362
Better hurry.

966
01:06:30,572 --> 01:06:31,531
Dad!

967
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:35,368
I'm sorry.

968
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:37,370
This is all my fault.

969
01:06:38,788 --> 01:06:40,664
Hey, hey, hey.

970
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,041
No.

971
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:44,878
I messed up.

972
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:46,379
Cassie.

973
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:49,548
My whole life happened because I messed up.

974
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,635
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

975
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,015
Dad!

976
01:06:58,724 --> 01:06:59,683
It's okay.

977
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,976
It's okay.

978
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,189
I love you, Peanut.

979
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:08,233
I love you too.

980
01:07:52,317 --> 01:07:53,984
Okay. I'm in.

981
01:07:57,279 --> 01:07:59,282
Darren, can you hear me?

982
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:00,366
Darren?

983
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:02,576
Darren?

984
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:06,831
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

985
01:08:06,998 --> 01:08:08,081
<i>What?</i>

986
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:10,042
<i>- I'm in.
- Okay.</i>

987
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:13,295
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

988
01:08:14,797 --> 01:08:15,964
<i>Don't die?</i>

989
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:19,592
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

990
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:20,928
<i>Do you see it?</i>

991
01:08:22,387 --> 01:08:23,554
Yeah. I see it.

992
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:30,185
I'm heading in.

993
01:08:33,565 --> 01:08:34,482
What the hell?

994
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:35,525
What the hell?

995
01:08:35,692 --> 01:08:36,526
What the hell?

996
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:39,402
<i>I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.</i>

997
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,696
You never said that.

998
01:08:40,862 --> 01:08:42,115
Why am I looking at another me?

999
01:08:42,282 --> 01:08:43,825
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1000
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:44,908
You just came out...

1001
01:08:45,075 --> 01:08:46,701
Why am I looking at another me?

1002
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:50,039
<i>You're looking at the possibility
of another you.</i>

1003
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:51,956
<i>You're in a Probability Storm.</i>

1004
01:08:52,123 --> 01:08:54,250
What does any of that mean?

1005
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:56,085
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

1006
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:57,170
Because you got me in here.

1007
01:08:57,338 --> 01:08:58,547
So, I am the real one, huh?

1008
01:08:58,713 --> 01:08:59,630
No. I didn't say that.

1009
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:02,425
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1010
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:03,508
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1011
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:04,719
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- What the hell?

1012
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:05,927
What the hell?

1013
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:08,014
What is this place?

1014
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,266
<i>It's a Probability Storm.</i>

1015
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:13,268
<i>Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.</i>

1016
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:14,854
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1017
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:17,440
<i>- What's he saying?
- You're inside Schrödinger's box.</i>

1018
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:18,608
<i>And you're the cat.</i>

1019
01:09:18,775 --> 01:09:20,234
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

1020
01:09:20,401 --> 01:09:22,109
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1021
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:24,404
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1022
01:09:24,571 --> 01:09:25,615
- What the hell?
- Am I real?

1023
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:26,658
- Am I real?
- Am I real?

1024
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:28,116
- I am the real one!
- What the hell?

1025
01:09:28,283 --> 01:09:30,202
What the hell. I'm the real one.

1026
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:31,870
Guys. Hey, relax.

1027
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:33,705
Take it easy. Breathe.

1028
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:35,957
We'll figure this out. Together.

1029
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:37,125
Who are you?

1030
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,668
Why are you dressed like that?

1031
01:09:39,627 --> 01:09:41,129
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1032
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:43,046
This is my uniform.

1033
01:09:43,214 --> 01:09:44,506
These are normal clothes.

1034
01:09:44,674 --> 01:09:45,966
Why are you dressed like that?

1035
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,594
- Do you have ice cream?
- Enough!

1036
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:48,804
Let's do this!

1037
01:09:56,976 --> 01:09:58,479
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1038
01:10:00,856 --> 01:10:01,857
Wait.

1039
01:10:02,483 --> 01:10:03,693
Wait. Wait!

1040
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:04,943
No! No!

1041
01:10:05,485 --> 01:10:07,570
<i>No! Wait! No!</i>

1042
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,073
I've got a read on Scott.

1043
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:25,672
Out of the way!

1044
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:27,923
- Mom! What is this?
- What are you doing?

1045
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,843
<i>Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.</i>

1046
01:10:31,136 --> 01:10:32,429
<i>They're not you.</i>

1047
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,722
Scott, where are you?

1048
01:10:38,976 --> 01:10:39,977
Why am I here?

1049
01:10:40,978 --> 01:10:42,813
<i>Don't worry. It'll work this time.</i>

1050
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,773
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1051
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,443
<i>- Stop! No!
- I got this, guys.</i>

1052
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:54,825
<i>I got this!
I got it!</i>

1053
01:10:59,245 --> 01:11:00,455
Scott, where are you?

1054
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,040
Scott!

1055
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:07,086
Where are you, Scott?

1056
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:10,255
<i>- I can't breathe.
- Ow, that's my neck.</i>

1057
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,967
<i>Stop kicking me!</i>

1058
01:11:15,636 --> 01:11:17,220
<i>- My back!
- We're all gonna die!</i>

1059
01:11:18,388 --> 01:11:19,389
Dad.

1060
01:11:22,225 --> 01:11:23,477
<i>Come back.</i>

1061
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:25,395
<i>Dad...</i>

1062
01:11:26,188 --> 01:11:27,606
<i>if you can hear me...</i>

1063
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:30,692
<i>come back.
Just come back.</i>

1064
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:33,277
<i>- Don't give up.
- Come on.</i>

1065
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:36,073
<i>- Dad, just come back one more time.
- Come on.</i>

1066
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:37,824
<i>- She needs us.
- Please.</i>

1067
01:11:37,991 --> 01:11:39,575
<i>- Yes, come on.
- Come back.</i>

1068
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,619
<i>She needs us.
Let's do it together.</i>

1069
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,829
<i>- Get him up! Get him up!
- Grab him! Grab him!</i>

1070
01:11:43,913 --> 01:11:45,122
Let's go.

1071
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:48,042
<i>- Come on, lift him!
- Yes!</i>

1072
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:50,419
<i>- I got ya, I got ya! Go.
- Come on. That's it.</i>

1073
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,421
<i>- Come on!
- Give him a boost! Give him a boost!</i>

1074
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,134
<i>Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!</i>

1075
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:59,011
<i>Everyone together!</i>

1076
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:00,221
What are you doing?

1077
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,514
How are you able to do that?

1078
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:03,682
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

1079
01:12:05,266 --> 01:12:06,936
We all want the same thing.

1080
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:10,563
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1081
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:20,573
Go get her, pal.

1082
01:12:25,953 --> 01:12:27,496
Everyone, let's go!

1083
01:12:29,874 --> 01:12:31,125
Come on!

1084
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:40,092
Come on, closer.

1085
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:41,135
<i>Get him higher!</i>

1086
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:42,970
<i>Hang on, guys, hang on.</i>

1087
01:12:44,263 --> 01:12:45,805
<i>Careful. Steady, steady.</i>

1088
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,644
<i>Steady. That's it.</i>

1089
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:51,812
<i>Let's go.</i>

1090
01:12:58,192 --> 01:12:59,193
<i>What?</i>

1091
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:04,365
<i>- Oh no.
- What happened? Did it work?</i>

1092
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:06,242
Sorry, buddy!

1093
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:08,160
<i>- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.</i>

1094
01:13:18,253 --> 01:13:20,255
<i>Hope, are you real?</i>

1095
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,089
<i>I'm real.</i>

1096
01:13:22,716 --> 01:13:23,717
<i>Then let's do this.</i>

1097
01:13:28,721 --> 01:13:30,014
<i>You ready?</i>

1098
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:31,182
<i>Ready.</i>

1099
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:18,269
Come on.

1100
01:14:18,436 --> 01:14:19,520
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1101
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:20,521
No, no, no. Wait.

1102
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:21,772
He's got Cassie.

1103
01:14:22,314 --> 01:14:23,565
- What?
- Scott.

1104
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:26,193
- Janet.
- Give that to me.

1105
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,236
- We have to go now.
- No.

1106
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:28,612
He's got Cassie.

1107
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:31,448
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

1108
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:34,826
but you cannot give that to him.

1109
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:36,452
I wouldn't trust her.

1110
01:14:40,374 --> 01:14:42,166
Janet has a way of...

1111
01:14:45,253 --> 01:14:46,671
changing her mind.

1112
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:56,013
Hello, Jellybean.

1113
01:15:02,186 --> 01:15:03,270
So...

1114
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:08,692
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1115
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:14,531
<i>Well, well.</i>

1116
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:18,534
<i>If it isn't my old mentor.</i>

1117
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:23,915
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

1118
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:28,502
Darren?

1119
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:31,590
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1120
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:33,466
Holy shit, Darren.

1121
01:15:34,425 --> 01:15:35,760
What happened to you?

1122
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:38,387
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1123
01:15:49,022 --> 01:15:50,649
Do I need to take it?

1124
01:15:51,107 --> 01:15:52,275
Where is my daughter?

1125
01:15:54,361 --> 01:15:55,362
Scott.

1126
01:15:56,696 --> 01:15:57,697
Don't.

1127
01:15:58,615 --> 01:16:00,825
We had a deal.

1128
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:02,826
She'll be fine without you.

1129
01:16:28,352 --> 01:16:29,979
<i>So long, Hank.</i>

1130
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:38,528
Henry.

1131
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,996
You left me right here to die.

1132
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,625
Let's see how they do.

1133
01:17:54,434 --> 01:17:55,894
What did you see?

1134
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:07,988
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1135
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,116
But I always wondered.

1136
01:18:14,912 --> 01:18:16,830
When you touched my mind...

1137
01:18:28,299 --> 01:18:30,009
what did you see?

1138
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:32,095
A monster...

1139
01:18:33,554 --> 01:18:35,014
who thinks he's a god.

1140
01:18:35,431 --> 01:18:37,850
When you can see time the way I do...

1141
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,936
you don't get to close your eyes.

1142
01:18:40,103 --> 01:18:42,813
And you're the only one who sees?

1143
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:47,694
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

1144
01:18:47,986 --> 01:18:49,153
And who broke it?

1145
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:52,823
I did.

1146
01:18:54,032 --> 01:18:57,035
Every version of me.

1147
01:18:58,203 --> 01:18:59,663
My variants.

1148
01:19:00,372 --> 01:19:01,748
Throughout the Multiverse.

1149
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:07,254
Playing with time, like children.

1150
01:19:09,631 --> 01:19:12,675
But I saw how it ends.

1151
01:19:13,968 --> 01:19:15,970
I saw their chaos...

1152
01:19:16,762 --> 01:19:19,724
spreading across realities.

1153
01:19:20,891 --> 01:19:23,144
Universes colliding.

1154
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:25,854
Endless incursions.

1155
01:19:27,188 --> 01:19:29,150
I saw the Multiverse.

1156
01:19:30,318 --> 01:19:31,736
And it was dying.

1157
01:19:33,445 --> 01:19:34,779
All because of them.

1158
01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:38,116
So, I took control.

1159
01:19:38,825 --> 01:19:40,660
You mean you started a war.

1160
01:19:41,494 --> 01:19:44,748
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1161
01:19:45,874 --> 01:19:47,500
That's what monsters do.

1162
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:50,503
That's what conquerors do.

1163
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,757
They burn the broken world.

1164
01:19:54,758 --> 01:19:57,551
And they make a new one.

1165
01:19:57,718 --> 01:20:00,596
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1166
01:20:02,723 --> 01:20:05,059
You only want revenge because they beat you.

1167
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:06,935
Because you lost.

1168
01:20:07,311 --> 01:20:09,146
I have lost.

1169
01:20:10,813 --> 01:20:14,943
You have no idea what I have lost.

1170
01:20:16,487 --> 01:20:20,365
And I will burn them out of time...

1171
01:20:20,531 --> 01:20:21,949
for what they've done to me.

1172
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:26,871
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1173
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,708
Murdering trillions of people.

1174
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,629
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1175
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:58,068
<i>Oh, God. What am I doing?</i>

1176
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,037
<i>What?</i>

1177
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,166
<i>Hank!</i>

1178
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:20,172
Are these your ants?

1179
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,924
From the ant farm?

1180
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:23,967
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1181
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:25,760
How did you find them down here?

1182
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:29,931
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1183
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,728
<i>First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.</i>

1184
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:36,479
Some kind of interference.

1185
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:38,523
What is that?

1186
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:39,816
But it wasn't.

1187
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:42,402
It was the ants.

1188
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:47,239
They were reaching out the whole time.

1189
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,161
<i>Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.</i>

1190
01:21:52,745 --> 01:21:55,539
<i>They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...</i>

1191
01:21:56,123 --> 01:21:59,126
<i>expanding their knowledge,
their science...</i>

1192
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:02,296
<i>becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.</i>

1193
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,048
<i>I didn't find them.</i>

1194
01:22:04,923 --> 01:22:06,175
They found me.

1195
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:09,887
I told you they were smart.

1196
01:22:12,348 --> 01:22:17,352
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1197
01:22:17,644 --> 01:22:20,521
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

1198
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:23,566
- but we could learn a lot from these...
- Dad.

1199
01:22:24,651 --> 01:22:25,943
Yeah, they're my ants.

1200
01:22:26,694 --> 01:22:28,695
And ants don't give up.

1201
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:30,113
I don't care who this guy is.

1202
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,491
I don't care what he can do.

1203
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:32,700
I'm getting Cassie.

1204
01:22:33,034 --> 01:22:35,286
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1205
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:39,831
We've got some ideas.

1206
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:40,999
What are you thinking?

1207
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:44,169
Well, as a great writer once said...

1208
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,381
"There's always room to grow. "

1209
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:50,841
You read my book?

1210
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,930
Every goddamn word.

1211
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,933
Come on. Let's go to work.

1212
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,697
Hey! I'm sorry.

1213
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,700
That was probably terrifying.

1214
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,159
What are you doing here?

1215
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,036
I'm rescuing you.

1216
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,412
How?

1217
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,623
That's a good question.

1218
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,918
Does this thing have like a key?

1219
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,087
Or a card? Like a room key?

1220
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,463
Do you know, like a...

1221
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,425
Shit!

1222
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,141
<i>Jump and tap.</i>

1223
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:52,192
Jentorra.

1224
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,404
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1225
01:23:57,113 --> 01:23:58,115
How can I help?

1226
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:04,329
Wow.

1227
01:24:04,495 --> 01:24:05,663
Let's hurt 'em back.

1228
01:24:06,873 --> 01:24:08,082
Damn, you're cool.

1229
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:09,960
Do you have a plan?

1230
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:11,377
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1231
01:24:12,503 --> 01:24:13,588
Do you have a plan?

1232
01:24:13,755 --> 01:24:15,798
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1233
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:18,133
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

1234
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,552
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1235
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:21,888
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

1236
01:24:22,055 --> 01:24:23,014
Follow me.

1237
01:24:23,181 --> 01:24:24,682
Okay. Great.

1238
01:24:29,061 --> 01:24:31,939
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1239
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:35,942
And I'm taking it with me.

1240
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:54,835
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1241
01:25:04,095 --> 01:25:07,223
History is not written.

1242
01:25:09,224 --> 01:25:10,475
<i>It is forged.</i>

1243
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:13,104
<i>Today, we ascend.</i>

1244
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:18,984
<i>From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.</i>

1245
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:23,822
<i>Today we conquer eternity.</i>

1246
01:25:24,614 --> 01:25:26,783
<i>And the dynasty of Kang shall...</i>

1247
01:25:30,744 --> 01:25:32,413
<i>Hello? Is this working?</i>

1248
01:25:32,997 --> 01:25:33,998
Cassie?

1249
01:25:34,164 --> 01:25:36,042
<i>I can't tell if this is working.</i>

1250
01:25:37,419 --> 01:25:38,919
Okay. I think we're on.

1251
01:25:39,086 --> 01:25:40,504
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1252
01:25:40,671 --> 01:25:42,339
I thought you were getting the message out.

1253
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:44,842
Now!

1254
01:25:46,343 --> 01:25:48,512
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1255
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:49,680
<i>And I'm with Jentorra.</i>

1256
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:51,265
<i>He's not invincible.</i>

1257
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,440
I know it might feel like...

1258
01:25:59,605 --> 01:26:00,982
<i>it's too late...</i>

1259
01:26:02,608 --> 01:26:04,694
<i>like all we do is just lose.</i>

1260
01:26:05,236 --> 01:26:06,822
<i>But the family I've lost...</i>

1261
01:26:07,447 --> 01:26:09,073
<i>taught me to keep fighting.</i>

1262
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,117
<i>And if they were here, they would too.</i>

1263
01:26:11,951 --> 01:26:13,953
<i>We need to look out for the little guy.</i>

1264
01:26:14,494 --> 01:26:15,912
My dad taught me that.

1265
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,124
<i>'Cause when people needed help...</i>

1266
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:20,543
<i>he didn't look the other way.</i>

1267
01:26:21,044 --> 01:26:22,252
<i>And neither do we.</i>

1268
01:26:24,588 --> 01:26:25,547
We need to move!

1269
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,050
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1270
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,594
<i>I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.</i>

1271
01:26:30,761 --> 01:26:32,929
He knows he can't take all of us.

1272
01:26:33,096 --> 01:26:34,222
<i>Come to the...</i>

1273
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:35,390
Cassie.

1274
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,516
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1275
01:26:37,683 --> 01:26:39,311
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

1276
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:46,776
Find Lang's daughter.

1277
01:26:50,113 --> 01:26:51,155
Kill her.

1278
01:27:10,256 --> 01:27:11,299
Let's go. Let's go!

1279
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:13,134
If you want to fight, follow me!

1280
01:27:17,973 --> 01:27:19,182
<i>It's over, Cassie.</i>

1281
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,308
Free the others. Go!

1282
01:27:29,441 --> 01:27:30,526
He's gonna see us coming.

1283
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:32,736
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1284
01:27:33,655 --> 01:27:34,822
Begin the launch.

1285
01:28:27,164 --> 01:28:28,999
<i>Your dad's not here, Cassie...</i>

1286
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:31,168
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1287
01:28:54,606 --> 01:28:55,815
<i>Kang!</i>

1288
01:28:56,983 --> 01:28:58,818
<i>We had a deal.</i>

1289
01:29:00,947 --> 01:29:03,239
<i>You took my daughter!</i>

1290
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:07,035
Holy shit.

1291
01:29:07,702 --> 01:29:08,870
That's big.

1292
01:29:17,628 --> 01:29:19,254
<i>You lied to me!</i>

1293
01:29:20,547 --> 01:29:22,676
<i>Our word is our bond.</i>

1294
01:29:23,468 --> 01:29:26,637
<i>Without that, we're nothing!</i>

1295
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:28,430
Bring him down.

1296
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:29,473
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1297
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,606
<i>Keep going. I've got them.</i>

1298
01:29:39,524 --> 01:29:40,858
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

1299
01:29:55,373 --> 01:29:56,582
<i>There's so many!</i>

1300
01:29:56,749 --> 01:29:59,002
<i>Scott! I can't hold them!</i>

1301
01:30:10,095 --> 01:30:11,138
<i>They came.</i>

1302
01:30:12,889 --> 01:30:14,891
<i>Way to go, Cassie!</i>

1303
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,395
Yes!

1304
01:30:18,729 --> 01:30:21,148
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

1305
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:28,030
Revolution!

1306
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,252
Burn it all down.

1307
01:30:43,419 --> 01:30:44,628
Fight!

1308
01:31:01,853 --> 01:31:03,730
Cover! Get down!

1309
01:31:12,405 --> 01:31:13,906
What is the bridge code?

1310
01:31:14,448 --> 01:31:15,574
<i>I'll die first.</i>

1311
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,409
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1312
01:31:17,868 --> 01:31:18,744
<i>Damn!</i>

1313
01:31:34,176 --> 01:31:35,343
You'll need this.

1314
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:38,554
Hi.

1315
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:40,431
This is our home!

1316
01:31:41,433 --> 01:31:42,809
Let's take it back!

1317
01:31:47,313 --> 01:31:48,314
No!

1318
01:31:55,613 --> 01:31:57,572
I have holes.

1319
01:31:59,366 --> 01:32:01,994
I have holes!

1320
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:10,002
I didn't know he could do that.

1321
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:20,720
<i>Kang!</i>

1322
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:22,597
<i>Where is she?</i>

1323
01:32:23,264 --> 01:32:24,516
Launch now!

1324
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:37,278
<i>What is that?</i>

1325
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:39,113
<i>He's getting out.</i>

1326
01:32:39,488 --> 01:32:40,697
<i>Oh, no, he's not.</i>

1327
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:49,914
Keep him away from the rings.

1328
01:33:29,161 --> 01:33:30,245
Dad!

1329
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:34,374
Dad, I'm coming!

1330
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:46,927
Dad!

1331
01:33:55,269 --> 01:33:56,770
Nowhere left to run.

1332
01:34:05,737 --> 01:34:06,863
Please let this work.

1333
01:34:25,298 --> 01:34:26,799
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1334
01:34:26,966 --> 01:34:27,925
Let's go.

1335
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:30,051
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1336
01:34:30,218 --> 01:34:31,803
Darren, just stop...

1337
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,599
trying to be whatever this is.

1338
01:34:35,391 --> 01:34:36,892
I don't know what to be.

1339
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:40,478
Tell me what to be.

1340
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,939
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1341
01:34:43,648 --> 01:34:45,108
It's too late.

1342
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:46,860
Look at me.

1343
01:34:48,445 --> 01:34:49,988
I'm such a dick.

1344
01:34:50,405 --> 01:34:52,823
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1345
01:34:58,538 --> 01:34:59,705
<i>We've gotta stop him.</i>

1346
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:02,916
<i>I have an idea.</i>

1347
01:35:05,629 --> 01:35:06,463
<i>Ready?</i>

1348
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:07,796
<i>Probably not.</i>

1349
01:35:10,591 --> 01:35:13,052
<i>One, two, three. Now!</i>

1350
01:35:36,073 --> 01:35:37,407
Dad!

1351
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,660
Dad!

1352
01:35:39,494 --> 01:35:40,495
Cassie?

1353
01:35:42,497 --> 01:35:43,372
You're huge.

1354
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:45,165
I'm huge.

1355
01:35:49,587 --> 01:35:51,171
I love you, Peanut.

1356
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:52,673
I love you too.

1357
01:35:53,048 --> 01:35:54,633
I'm so proud of you.

1358
01:35:55,384 --> 01:35:57,427
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1359
01:35:57,593 --> 01:36:00,180
I know. It feels so cool.

1360
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:02,140
I know, right?

1361
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:04,017
I'm so hungry.

1362
01:36:04,184 --> 01:36:05,184
Yeah, that happens.

1363
01:36:05,351 --> 01:36:07,520
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1364
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:10,399
- But I really want like a lime.
- Right?

1365
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:12,608
- Citrus. It's weird. I know.
- Citrus.

1366
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:13,776
It's...

1367
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,080
Take the tower!

1368
01:36:57,693 --> 01:36:58,944
It's over.

1369
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:02,865
You still can't see it.

1370
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:07,745
It's never over.

1371
01:38:24,484 --> 01:38:26,236
- We have to go, right now.
- No.

1372
01:38:26,403 --> 01:38:27,404
- Come on.
- No!

1373
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:28,655
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1374
01:38:28,822 --> 01:38:30,199
- No!
- Come on.

1375
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:21,664
<i>You son of a...</i>

1376
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:26,252
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1377
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:27,545
Come on.

1378
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,928
You think this is new to me?

1379
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:40,974
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1380
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:44,143
No, no, no.

1381
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,814
How many worlds I've conquered?

1382
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,900
How many Avengers I've killed?

1383
01:39:51,067 --> 01:39:53,611
And you think you can beat me?

1384
01:39:53,778 --> 01:39:55,404
I am Kang!

1385
01:39:55,571 --> 01:39:56,490
You...

1386
01:39:57,532 --> 01:39:59,784
You talk to ants.

1387
01:41:19,651 --> 01:41:22,195
My name is Darren...

1388
01:41:22,363 --> 01:41:26,867
and I am not a dick!

1389
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:49,639
Sorry I'm late.

1390
01:41:51,933 --> 01:41:53,184
Lotta ants.

1391
01:41:54,603 --> 01:41:55,603
Oh, is this you?

1392
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,190
You were right about me, Cassie.

1393
01:42:00,483 --> 01:42:01,484
Darren.

1394
01:42:03,276 --> 01:42:04,277
Are you okay?

1395
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:08,282
Probably not.

1396
01:42:09,616 --> 01:42:11,284
- Darren?
- Hi, Hope.

1397
01:42:12,244 --> 01:42:13,745
You changed your hair.

1398
01:42:16,457 --> 01:42:18,333
What the hell happened?

1399
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:19,918
Yeah. No...

1400
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,920
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

1401
01:42:22,712 --> 01:42:23,713
That was...

1402
01:42:24,255 --> 01:42:25,673
I don't know what to say.

1403
01:42:26,257 --> 01:42:27,550
Thanks, Scott.

1404
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:31,387
You always were a brother to me.

1405
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:34,515
I was?

1406
01:42:42,398 --> 01:42:43,482
I was.

1407
01:42:57,620 --> 01:42:59,290
And at least I died...

1408
01:43:00,832 --> 01:43:02,375
an Avenger.

1409
01:43:05,628 --> 01:43:06,671
Yeah.

1410
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:08,589
- You did.
- Yeah.

1411
01:43:09,464 --> 01:43:10,466
You're in.

1412
01:43:27,065 --> 01:43:28,692
A lot has happened today.

1413
01:43:29,484 --> 01:43:30,610
<i>- Henry?
- Janet?</i>

1414
01:43:30,776 --> 01:43:32,613
<i>- Mom, where are you?
- I'm in the tower.</i>

1415
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:34,781
I think I can give us one shot back.

1416
01:43:34,948 --> 01:43:36,742
But we don't have much time.

1417
01:43:36,949 --> 01:43:38,576
If we wanna go home...

1418
01:43:41,037 --> 01:43:42,456
we have to go now.

1419
01:43:43,081 --> 01:43:44,082
We'll finish this.

1420
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,418
Thank you.

1421
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:49,378
Thank you.

1422
01:43:51,464 --> 01:43:53,007
Come on! Let's go!

1423
01:43:53,174 --> 01:43:54,383
All right. Good luck.

1424
01:43:54,759 --> 01:43:55,801
Good luck.
Come on.

1425
01:44:26,498 --> 01:44:27,499
Thanks, buddy.

1426
01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:30,834
You did it.

1427
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:35,755
Let's go home.

1428
01:44:57,609 --> 01:44:58,611
Where's Scott?

1429
01:44:58,778 --> 01:45:00,321
He was right behind me.

1430
01:45:43,404 --> 01:45:44,989
You should've looked the other way.

1431
01:45:45,156 --> 01:45:47,825
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1432
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:57,250
And you're not getting out.

1433
01:46:07,844 --> 01:46:09,262
I want you to remember.

1434
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:12,306
You could've gone home.

1435
01:46:27,446 --> 01:46:29,490
You could've seen your daughter again.

1436
01:46:43,253 --> 01:46:44,671
But you thought you could win.

1437
01:46:58,059 --> 01:46:59,561
I don't have to win.

1438
01:47:01,062 --> 01:47:02,980
We both just have to lose.

1439
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:55,447
Dad!

1440
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:03,580
Where... Where...

1441
01:48:03,872 --> 01:48:04,956
Where is she? Is she...

1442
01:48:05,123 --> 01:48:06,625
- No, she's okay.
- Where is she?

1443
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,167
She's okay. She's okay.

1444
01:48:08,584 --> 01:48:10,044
- Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
- She's safe?

1445
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:11,211
You did it.

1446
01:48:11,378 --> 01:48:12,380
You did it.

1447
01:48:15,799 --> 01:48:17,718
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- No, no, no.

1448
01:48:17,885 --> 01:48:19,303
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1449
01:48:19,929 --> 01:48:21,096
Don't let go.

1450
01:48:21,263 --> 01:48:22,514
Don't ever let go.

1451
01:48:24,141 --> 01:48:25,476
I got you.

1452
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:29,437
You came back.

1453
01:48:39,822 --> 01:48:41,115
I love you, Hope.

1454
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:45,119
I love you, Scott.

1455
01:49:58,981 --> 01:50:00,317
Let's go home.

1456
01:50:02,986 --> 01:50:04,194
Home's good.

1457
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,288
<i>My life doesn't make sense.</i>

1458
01:50:14,455 --> 01:50:16,790
<i>I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.</i>

<i>"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm

Rubin!

1466
01:50:34,974 --> 01:50:36,184
You are the bug!

1467
01:50:37,435 --> 01:50:39,937
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1468
01:50:40,103 --> 01:50:41,396
You're the bug man.

1469
01:50:41,563 --> 01:50:44,150
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1470
01:50:44,817 --> 01:50:47,444
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1471
01:50:47,611 --> 01:50:48,612
Twelve dollar.

1472
01:50:50,447 --> 01:50:51,490
Twelve!

retirement for you.

1476

Wow.

1477
01:51:04,878 --> 01:51:06,171
You made this yourself?

1478
01:51:06,338 --> 01:51:08,757
- Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
- I know.

1479
01:51:08,924 --> 01:51:10,716
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

1480
01:51:10,883 --> 01:51:12,093
You're a real artist.

<i>He was getting out and he didn't get out.</i>

1487
01:51:29,277 --> 01:51:30,361
<i>I think.</i>

1488
01:51:31,861 --> 01:51:34,447
<i>But he also said something bad was coming...</i>

1489
01:51:34,864 --> 01:51:37,952
<i>and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.</i>

1490
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:40,745
<i>Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?</i>

1491
01:51:41,454 --> 01:51:43,498
<i>Is everyone gonna die because of me?</i>

1492
01:51:43,665 --> 01:51:44,791
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1493
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:47,377
<i>Oh my... What did I do?</i>

1494
01:51:49,588 --> 01:51:50,964
<i>What did I do?</i>

1495
01:51:54,466 --> 01:51:56,552
<i>You know what? It's probably fine.</i>

1496
01:51:57,094 --> 01:51:59,180
<i>Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...</i>

1497
01:51:59,347 --> 01:52:02,474
<i>so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.</i>

1498
01:52:02,641 --> 01:52:04,101
<i>Stop overthinking it.</i>

1499
01:52:06,604 --> 01:52:08,396
Surprise!

1500
01:52:08,564 --> 01:52:12,693
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

1501
01:52:13,903 --> 01:52:15,236
It's not my birthday.

1502
01:52:15,403 --> 01:52:17,906
I know. But I missed a few.

1503
01:52:20,326 --> 01:52:22,201
<i>This is good. We're all together.</i>

1504
01:52:22,577 --> 01:52:23,995
<i>You're fine.</i>

1505
01:52:24,162 --> 01:52:27,081
<i>Everything's probably fine.</i>

1506
01:52:27,248 --> 01:52:29,583
<i>Kang's gone. You did it.</i>

1507
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:32,462
<i>Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.</i>

1508
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:33,630
Thanks.

1509
01:52:37,132 --> 01:52:39,134
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1510
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:20,580
So, the exiled one is dead.

1511
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,793
You sure he's dead?

1512
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:28,296
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1513
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,049
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

1514
01:55:32,383 --> 01:55:35,053
None of us...

1515
01:55:35,887 --> 01:55:37,597
killed him.

1516
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,267
They did.

1517
01:55:42,142 --> 01:55:46,689
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1518
01:55:47,356 --> 01:55:48,816
And if we let them...

1519
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,110
they will take...

1520
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:54,153
everything...

1521
01:55:55,072 --> 01:55:57,074
we've built.

1522
01:55:58,117 --> 01:56:00,661
So let's stop wasting time.

1523
01:56:04,289 --> 01:56:05,499
We're late.

1524
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:09,836
How many did you call?

1525
01:56:10,169 --> 01:56:12,589
All of us.

1526
02:03:35,470 --> 02:03:40,475
Time is everything.

1527
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:48,733
It shapes our lives.

1528
02:03:50,026 --> 02:03:53,988
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1529
02:03:55,781 --> 02:03:56,865
it.

1530
02:03:58,116 --> 02:03:59,244
It's him.

1531
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:02,955
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

1532
02:04:04,623 --> 02:04:05,707
He is.
