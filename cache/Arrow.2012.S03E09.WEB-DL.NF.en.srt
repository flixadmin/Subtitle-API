a machine could process information...

465
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,022
...as fast as a human brain
was to build a mainframe the size of Texas.

466
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,901
But one developer realized the only way
to reduce heat and power consumption...

467
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,695
...was to bring the components
closer together.

468
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,780
Which meant making them smaller.

469

But why stop at computers?

470
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,910
What if I could take other things?

471
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,581
Like, say, all of the military grade technology
in Applied Sciences and make it smaller too.

472
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,044
So small that it could fit
in the palm of my hand.

-I don't understand.

I don't doubt you can beat him.

I am terrified that you won't kill him.

Because that's not who you are anymore.

The first is that whoever I am...

...I'm someone that will do whatever...

RA'S AL GHUL: I was 11 years old
when I killed my first man.

522
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:23,783
And I remember the look on his face
when the light went out behind his eyes.

523
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,661
Such a sudden change.

Almost imperceptible...

I'd stolen from that man
the most precious gift of all. Life.

Pride.

530
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,517
Because I had taken up arms against someone
