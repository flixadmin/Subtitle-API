00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,592
<font color=#ffff00><i>We swap in parts from Ford
Plymouths and Cadillac.</i></font>

3
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,519
<font color=#ffff00><i>My grandfather bought it in 1957.</i></font>

4
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,023
<font color=#ffff00><i>When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.</i></font>

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,299
<font color=#ffff00><i>Look at this,
this is an engine from a boat.</i></font>

6
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color=#ffff00><i>- No way.
- Yeah!</i></font>

7
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,721
<font color=#ffff00><i>Whatever it takes to keep it running!</i></font>

8
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,719
<font color=#ffff00>This is a cuban spirit.</font>

9
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,889
<font color=#ffff00><i>Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.</i></font>

10
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,741
<font color=#ffff00><i>Dom..</i></font>

<font color=#ffff00><i>Come on, come on.</i></font>

13
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,779
<font color=#ffff00><i>Please don't do this,
Understand my problem.</i></font>

14
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,989
<font color=#ffff00>You know I can't make
living without my car.</font>

15
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,043
<font color=#ffff00>Isn't my problem bro.</font>

16

<font color=#ffff00>Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.</font>

17
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,234
<font color=#ffff00>Welcome to my island.</font>

18
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,243
<font color=#ffff00>Why he hooking up
my cousin's car?</font>

19
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:06,591
<font color=#ffff00>In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay.. I take the car.</font>

20
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:07,904
<font color=#ffff00>I just need a few more days.</font>

21
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,574
<font color=#ffff00>Few more days isn't
part of the deal.</font>

22
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,055
<font color=#ffff00>Come on..</font>

23
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:13,350
<font color=#ffff00>You make a deal
you gotta live up to it.</font>

00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,299
<font color=#ffff00>You make a deal
You gonna live up to it.</font>

25
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,339
<font color=#ffff00>Gonna live up to it?</font>

26
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,374
<font color=#ffff00>So you are one of those types..</font>

27
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,988
<font color=#ffff00>You take everyone's ride and then
ship it back to the states.</font>

28
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,450
<font color=#ffff00><i>You should show your
people some respect.</i></font>

29
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:30,177
<font color=#ffff00>You watch your mouth.</font>

30
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,398
<font color=#ffff00>Now you got a problem.</font>

31
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,921
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna keep it about the cars.</font>

32
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,068
<font color=#ffff00><i>I am really scared.</i></font>

33
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,947
<font color=#ffff00>You want a car?
Get it the right way.</font>

34
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,614
<font color=#ffff00>- How?
- Race war.</font>

35
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,008
<font color=#ffff00>I already own it, bro.</font>

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,315
<font color=#ffff00>Not that car.</font>

37
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:52,955
<font color=#ffff00>Mine.</font>

38
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:57,143
<font color=#ffff00>Dom, his car is the
fastest car in the Island.</font>

39
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,059
<font color=#ffff00>Do you know what he
has under the hood?</font>

40
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,220
<font color=#ffff00>Do you know, it doesn't matter
what's under a hood?</font>

41
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:05,333
<font color=#ffff00>The only thing that matters is
who's behind the wheel.</font>

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,067
<font color=#ffff00>- You think so?
- I know so.</font>

43
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,147
<font color=#ffff00>Then race his car.</font>

44
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,771
<font color=#ffff00>We ain't racing a quarter mile here.</font>

45
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:16,799
<font color=#ffff00>We race the cuban mile.</font>

46
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,195
<font color=#ffff00>Done!</font>

47
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,695
<font color=#ffff00>I appreciate you what
you're trying to do.</font>

48
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:39,003
<font color=#ffff00>My car is the slowest
car on the Island.</font>

49
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,137
<font color=#ffff00>Was...!</font>

50
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:46,219
<font color=#ffff00>Pull the seats the doors
the battery..</font>

51
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,358
<font color=#ffff00>It ain't the motor, take it off.</font>

52
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,286
<font color=#ffff00>- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed. This is cuban NOS.</font>

53
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,237
<font color=#ffff00>You guys are crazy.</font>

54
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,801
<font color=#ffff00>- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.</font>

55
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,428
<font color=#ffff00>Pull that back in line..
Hold on!</font>

56
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,555
<font color=#ffff00>Old trick used to play.</font>

57
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,492
<font color=#ffff00>In case of emergencies.</font>

58
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,639
<font color=#ffff00>You know that's way too much
booze for that engine.</font>

59
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:11,331
<font color=#ffff00>- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.</font>

60
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,468
<font color=#ffff00>Only needs to go a mile.</font>

61
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,522
<font color=#ffff00><i>Are you ready for this, family?</i></font>

62
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,514
<font color=#ffff00><i>This is Havana!</i></font>

63
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:47,520
<font color=#ffff00><i>Be fast!</i></font>

64
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,042
<font color=#ffff00><i>Be safe!</i></font>

65
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:54,672
<font color=#ffff00><i>But don't be last.
Racers ready...?</i></font>

66
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,327
<font color=#ffff00><i>Go...!</i></font>

67
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,471
<font color=#ffff00><i>Stop.</i></font>

68
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,849
<font color=#ffff00>That car belongs in the trash bro.</font>

69
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,814
<font color=#ffff00>- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Let's go.</font>

70
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,941
<font color=#ffff00>- Go steer.
- Si.</font>

71
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,135
<font color=#ffff00>Adios, Toretto.</font>

72
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,819
<font color=#ffff00>Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.</font>

73
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,991
<font color=#ffff00>That's impossible..</font>

74
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,297
<font color=#ffff00>Look out.</font>

75
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,027
<font color=#ffff00>A deal's a deal.</font>

76
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,374
<font color=#ffff00>You own my car.</font>

77
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,285
<font color=#ffff00>And you earn my respect.</font>

78
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:01,993
<font color=#ffff00>Keep your car.</font>

79
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,024
<font color=#ffff00>Your respect is
good enough for me.</font>

80
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:11,914
<font color=#ffff00>Yo Cousin.</font>

81
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:14,409
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry 'bout your car,</font>

82
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,685
<font color=#ffff00>Your's was too slow
for a Torreto anyway.</font>

83
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,292
<font color=#ffff00>Your Impala.
Are you serious?</font>

84
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,463
<font color=#ffff00>Look at that smile</font>

85
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,250
<font color=#ffff00>I love it when you smile.</font>

86
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:17,090
<font color=#ffff00>Make me happy.</font>

87
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,947
<font color=#ffff00>I think this place makes you happy.</font>

88
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,326
<font color=#ffff00>It's like it speaks to you.</font>

89
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:31,208
<font color=#ffff00>You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.</font>

90
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,128
<font color=#ffff00>- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!</font>

91
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,248
<font color=#ffff00>- Yeah.
- Of course.</font>

92
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,106
<font color=#ffff00>I was looking at them, and I..</font>

93
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,292
<font color=#ffff00>And I couldn't help but too imagine
what you'd be like, if you were dad.</font>

94
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,287
<font color=#ffff00>No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.</font>

95
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,201
<font color=#ffff00>Is that what you want?</font>

96
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,965
<font color=#ffff00>It's not about what I want
or what you want..</font>

97
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,661
<font color=#ffff00>It's about why
we haven't asked the question.</font>

98
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,301
<font color=#ffff00><i>Can I help you with that?</i></font>

99
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,367
<font color=#ffff00>- What?
- You need a hand?</font>

100
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,234
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, I think I do.</font>

101
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,538
<font color=#ffff00>Sounds like you're
not getting any fuel.</font>

102
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:35,608
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

103
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,344
<font color=#ffff00>See if we can get
some power into it.</font>

104
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:43,220
<font color=#ffff00>What brings you to Cuba?</font>

105
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,041
<font color=#ffff00>The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.</font>

106
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,230
<font color=#ffff00>Culture. People. Beauty.</font>

107
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,325
<font color=#ffff00>What brings you to Cuba?</font>

108
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,365
<font color=#ffff00>- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.</font>

109
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,865
<font color=#ffff00>How is that honeymoon going Dom?</font>

110
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:06,182
<font color=#ffff00>Your fuel relay is missing.</font>

111
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,379
<font color=#ffff00>I know.</font>

112
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,917
<font color=#ffff00>I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.</font>

113
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,126
<font color=#ffff00>I'm kinda in a rush,
so if you got something to say...</font>

114
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,395
<font color=#ffff00>Oh this is a very different game
that I can assure you.</font>

115
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,387
<font color=#ffff00>This...?</font>

116
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:27,662
<font color=#ffff00>There is something much greater
at work here.</font>

117
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,308
<font color=#ffff00>This is fate.</font>

118
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,336
<font color=#ffff00>- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.</font>

119
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,887
<font color=#ffff00>This is the road you take
to your apartment every morning.</font>

120
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,367
<font color=#ffff00>What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?</font>

121
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,929
<font color=#ffff00>Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your cuban coffee?</font>

122
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,947
<font color=#ffff00>So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?</font>

123
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:50,160
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.. I've put a lot of work
into getting you here in today.</font>

124
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,399
<font color=#ffff00>Now that I'm here,
what do you want?</font>

125
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,199
<font color=#ffff00>I want you to work for me.</font>

126
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,004
<font color=#ffff00>Work for you?</font>

127
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,430
<font color=#ffff00>Well, I could have saved you
a lot of time then.</font>

128
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,562
<font color=#ffff00>See, I don't work for anyone.</font>

129
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,887
<font color=#ffff00>You can't walk away from this Dom.</font>

130
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,589
<font color=#ffff00>We're gonna have this
conversation one way or the other.</font>

131
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,217
<font color=#ffff00>See that's the funny
thing about fate.</font>

132
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:11,687
<font color=#ffff00>It's cunning.</font>

133
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:13,591
<font color=#ffff00>It can bring you beautiful things,</font>

134
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,672
<font color=#ffff00>and it can also bring you
moments like this.</font>

135
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,277
<font color=#ffff00>I will hear that you
want to work for me.</font>

136
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,944
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna betray your brothers,</font>

137
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,179
<font color=#ffff00>abandon your code,
shatter your family.</font>

138
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,393
<font color=#ffff00>See, your team..</font>

00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,556
<font color=#ffff00>Is about to go up against the
only thing they can't handle.</font>

140
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,237
<font color=#ffff00>What's that?</font>

141
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:46,837
<font color=#ffff00>You.</font>

142
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:52,133
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, and Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.</font>

143
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,338
<font color=#ffff00>They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they've got.</font>

144
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:06,272
<font color=#ffff00>So, we wanna engage
with maximum speed.</font>

145
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,291
<font color=#ffff00>Neutralize the shooters
and then move on to our objective.</font>

146
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,954
<font color=#ffff00>There are two things
I want you to keep in mind,</font>

147
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,043
<font color=#ffff00>Number one,</font>

148
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,558
<font color=#ffff00>I choose you for this squad</font>

149
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:18,174
<font color=#ffff00>because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.</font>

150
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,538
<font color=#ffff00>And number two,</font>

151
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,915
<font color=#ffff00>You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.</font>

152
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:25,585
<font color=#ffff00>Everyone...
And I mean everyone..</font>

153
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,230
<font color=#ffff00>Manice and pedice at the mall.</font>

154
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:29,607
<font color=#ffff00>Later on today.</font>

155
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,021
<font color=#ffff00>I don't wanna play anymore.</font>

156
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,851
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.</font>

157
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,100
<font color=#ffff00>- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.</font>

158
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:43,127
<font color=#ffff00>Oh yeah. That's moms
they come out to sport the kids.</font>

159
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,124
<font color=#ffff00>Except there seems to be more moms
than kids,</font>

160
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,420
<font color=#ffff00>Way more like moms and..</font>

161
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,294
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.</font>

162
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,267
<font color=#ffff00>So your intel was spot on...</font>

163
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:58,482
<font color=#ffff00>A democly 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the gulf.</font>

164
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,134
<font color=#ffff00>Arms dealer from the
Liberation front have it in Berlin.</font>

165
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:02,789
<font color=#ffff00>- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..</font>

166
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:04,953
<font color=#ffff00>An entire electrical grid
in a major city.</font>

167
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:07,344
<font color=#ffff00>No lights, no power,
instant stone age.</font>

168
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:08,952
<font color=#ffff00>Chloe, Maya...</font>

169
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,313
<font color=#ffff00>You can't let her run
by you like that.</font>

170
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,732
<font color=#ffff00>- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.</font>

171
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,396
<font color=#ffff00>This is a class 4 WMD.</font>

172
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,056
<font color=#ffff00>Do you have any idea what's
at stake here...?</font>

173
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,388
<font color=#ffff00>Yes...! I know exactly what is
at stake here, okay?</font>

174
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,548
<font color=#ffff00>If Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragon</font>

175
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,737
<font color=#ffff00>that means we lose the championship.</font>

176
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,471
<font color=#ffff00>Which means I have 20 little girls
who are crying..</font>

177
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:25,835
<font color=#ffff00>And that's not a good thing.</font>

178
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,626
<font color=#ffff00>Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice cream shops</font>

179
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,458
<font color=#ffff00>and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.</font>

180
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,213
<font color=#ffff00>- Tay-Tay?
- Yep? Taylor Swift.</font>

181
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,162
<font color=#ffff00>You gotta be shitting me
Get it together.</font>

182
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:37,554
<font color=#ffff00>Let's go girls.</font>

183
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,635
<font color=#ffff00>We need you to do this,</font>

184
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,761
<font color=#ffff00>Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.</font>

185
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:45,147
<font color=#ffff00>US Government can not sanction
this operation in anyway.</font>

186
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,217
<font color=#ffff00>You're on your own.</font>

187
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,602
<font color=#ffff00>This thing goes sideways
you don't just get burned,</font>

188
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:50,206
<font color=#ffff00>you go to prison.</font>

189
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,566
<font color=#ffff00>And there's nothing we can do
to get you out.</font>

190
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,167
<font color=#ffff00>Let me tell you something.</font>

191
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:58,340
<font color=#ffff00>The only thing that I love
more than saving lives..</font>

192
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,343
<font color=#ffff00>Is my daughter.</font>

193
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,302
<font color=#ffff00>So you don't shut up with this
government bullshit right now</font>

194
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:08,149
<font color=#ffff00>and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons.</font>

195
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:12,289
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined
up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.</font>

<font color=#ffff00>Go Dragons..

202
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,206
<font color=#ffff00>That is my daughter right there!

<font color=#ffff00>Ah, yes, come here.</font>

204
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,285
<font color=#ffff00>- Awesome.

205
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,220
<font color=#ffff00>Daddy's gotta go to work?</font>

206
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,384
<font color=#ffff00>Oh yeah,
daddy's gotta go to work.</font>

207
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,354
<font color=#ffff00>Now, you gonna need to get a team
that you can trust.</font>

208
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,694
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, I already got one.</font>

209
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,146
<font color=#ffff00>- Hey, Dom.

210
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,684
<font color=#ffff00>We got a job in Berlin,
and I need a favor, brother.</font>

211
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,096
<font color=#ffff00>No problem.</font>

212
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,826
<font color=#ffff00>I grab the team and
meet you in Berlin.</font>

213
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,657
<font color=#ffff00>Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.</font>

214
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,781
<font color=#ffff00>You were only to supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.</font>

215
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,095
<font color=#ffff00>That was a diversion.</font>

216
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,982
<font color=#ffff00>How many of the damn explosives
did you use?</font>

217
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,325
<font color=#ffff00>I do not know, Tez.
All of it?</font>

218
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,428
<font color=#ffff00>- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!</font>

219
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:03,362
<font color=#ffff00>- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.</font>

220
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,346
<font color=#ffff00>They're still on us.</font>

221
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,836
<font color=#ffff00>These guys are taking this personal.</font>

222
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,941
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, we just blown up their
facility and stole their EMP.</font>

223
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,794
<font color=#ffff00>Other than your doctor's cold fingers,</font>

224
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,070
<font color=#ffff00>I'd say it's about as
personal as it can get.</font>

225
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,318
<font color=#ffff00>- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?</font>

226
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:24,445
<font color=#ffff00>So you just gonna keep
that to yourself?</font>

227
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:25,709
<font color=#ffff00>What happen to Phase 1?</font>

228
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,909
<font color=#ffff00>What about that part?</font>

229
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,390
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, remember the airplane?</font>

230
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,375
<font color=#ffff00>Everyone drove their
cars out but you.</font>

231
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:32,214
<font color=#ffff00>I told you my engine seized up.</font>

232
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,352
<font color=#ffff00>It's your balls that seized up?</font>

233
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,656
<font color=#ffff00>Just follow my lead, okay?</font>

234
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,388
<font color=#ffff00>And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.</font>

235
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:40,389
<font color=#ffff00>Tez, drop it.</font>

236
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:41,889
<font color=#ffff00>Bomb's away.</font>

237
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,328
<font color=#ffff00>Split now!</font>

238
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,564
<font color=#ffff00>Holy shit!</font>

239
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:52,432
<font color=#ffff00><i>Look out...!</i></font>

240
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,707
<font color=#ffff00>- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.</font>

241
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:09,935
<font color=#ffff00>You miss some.</font>

242
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,312
<font color=#ffff00>I'll just wait for it.</font>

243
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,988
<font color=#ffff00>Oh... Shit!</font>

244
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,434
<font color=#ffff00>I hate you, Tez!</font>

245
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,775
<font color=#ffff00>Got your ass.</font>

246
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:39,978
<font color=#ffff00>You good?</font>

247
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:44,232
<font color=#ffff00>I'll see you when it's done.</font>

248
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,035
<font color=#ffff00>Alright. Great job, team.</font>

249
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,004
<font color=#ffff00>Let's break up and meet
me at the safe house.</font>

250
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,114
<font color=#ffff00>Hell of a job, brother.</font>

251
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,160
<font color=#ffff00>When we can get back
to the base. Beers on me.</font>

252
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:35,144
<font color=#ffff00>You lost your god damn mind,
Toretto!</font>

253
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,341
<font color=#ffff00>Toretto you put hands on that thing,</font>

254
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:43,157
<font color=#ffff00>you're gonna have the whole world
coming for you including me.</font>

255
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,366
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know what you're doing</font>

256
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,012
<font color=#ffff00>but you better think
about this, Toretto.</font>

257
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:54,245
<font color=#ffff00>It ain't too late to stop this.</font>

258
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,352
<font color=#ffff00>It is now.</font>

259
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:15,152
<font color=#ffff00>That some bitch just crossed us..</font>

260
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:15,714
<font color=#ffff00>What?</font>

261
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,247
<font color=#ffff00>Wait a second, what
are you talking about?</font>

262
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,599
<font color=#ffff00>- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.</font>

263
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:21,638
<font color=#ffff00>Where are you?</font>

264
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:23,258
<font color=#ffff00>It's too late for me.
Get out of here.</font>

265
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,157
<font color=#ffff00>Saw that look in his eyes.</font>

266
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:27,710
<font color=#ffff00>I've seen that look before.</font>

267
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,865
<font color=#ffff00>Dominic Toretto just went rogue.</font>

268
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,817
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.</font>

269
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,416
<font color=#ffff00>It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.</font>

270
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,783
<font color=#ffff00>Burner phone, right?</font>

271
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:38,874
<font color=#ffff00>Nah. Scrambled.</font>

272
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,484
<font color=#ffff00>Same number but they got
some sort of micro-router..</font>

273
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,959
<font color=#ffff00>To bury the signal path
which means Dom is clearly..</font>

274
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,374
<font color=#ffff00>Communicating with somebody
that is above our pay grade.</font>

275
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:48,498
<font color=#ffff00>Look,
I do not know Dom as well as you,</font>

276
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,393
<font color=#ffff00>but if we just look at the facts.</font>

277
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,125
<font color=#ffff00>Dom's been having highly encrypted</font>

278
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:55,935
<font color=#ffff00>conversation with some
mysterious person.</font>

279
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,597
<font color=#ffff00>He took out Hobbs.</font>

280
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:01,387
<font color=#ffff00>He stole the EMP,
now he's disappeared.</font>

281
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:02,575
<font color=#ffff00>So what're you saying?</font>

282
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,574
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe we should
consider the fact that..</font>

283
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:05,817
<font color=#ffff00>Hobb's right.</font>

284
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,323
<font color=#ffff00>Dom did go rogue.</font>

285
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,589
<font color=#ffff00>- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,</font>

286
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,930
<font color=#ffff00>Remember you're breathing
now because he saved your life.</font>

287
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,661
<font color=#ffff00>You just gonna let her
bump your shoulder like that</font>

288
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:29,830
<font color=#ffff00>I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.</font>

289
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,757
<font color=#ffff00>What're you gonna do.
Email her?</font>

290
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:37,658
<font color=#ffff00><i>Chick..</i></font>

291
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:49,852
<font color=#ffff00>No no, wait, fellas.</font>

292
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:52,238
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you.</font>

293
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,724
<font color=#ffff00>Well, this is an exciting new look.</font>

294
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,730
<font color=#ffff00>That's a little tight on
the crotch as always.</font>

295
00:26:58,164 --> 00:27:00,256
<font color=#ffff00>What boyband bus did she fallen off?</font>

296
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,269
<font color=#ffff00>My new junior associate.</font>

297
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,273
<font color=#ffff00>He's working with me on this.
All yours.</font>

298
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:04,945
<font color=#ffff00>Mr Nobody and I</font>

299
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:07,258
<font color=#ffff00>have been given the authority
to get you out of this.</font>

300
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:10,412
<font color=#ffff00>All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.</font>

301
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,460
<font color=#ffff00>Restraining wills, talking about,
what terms?</font>

302
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,968
<font color=#ffff00>Confess to your crimes in Berlin.</font>

303
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:17,863
<font color=#ffff00>Treason,
international espionage.</font>

304
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,949
<font color=#ffff00>Massive destruction
of civic property.</font>

305
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,849
<font color=#ffff00>You do that, we close the case.</font>

306
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:22,560
<font color=#ffff00>And?</font>

307
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,521
<font color=#ffff00>And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.</font>

308
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,467
<font color=#ffff00>Officially you'll be a criminal.</font>

309
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,368
<font color=#ffff00>Woah, woah, woah.</font>

310
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,166
<font color=#ffff00>You need to work on
your delivery alright.</font>

311
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:31,366
<font color=#ffff00>Unofficially.</font>

312
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,153
<font color=#ffff00>You're off the books.
Come work with me.</font>

313
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,930
<font color=#ffff00>- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on. Labels.</font>

314
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:42,465
<font color=#ffff00>There is no confession.</font>

315
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,106
<font color=#ffff00>There are no back room deals.</font>

316
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,435
<font color=#ffff00>Got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.</font>

317
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:47,146
<font color=#ffff00>You know that.</font>

318
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,123
<font color=#ffff00>I do and that's
what I told them.</font>

319
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,812
<font color=#ffff00>Well, there you have it.</font>

320
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,081
<font color=#ffff00>Good luck in the course, man!</font>

321
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,650
<font color=#ffff00>What about your daughter?</font>

322
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,606
<font color=#ffff00>You know, if you're not
gonna do it your country,</font>

323
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,462
<font color=#ffff00>at least do it for your kid.</font>

324
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,365
<font color=#ffff00>Big mistake kid.</font>

325
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:09,091
<font color=#ffff00>Hold on. Look, look.</font>

326
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,837
<font color=#ffff00>He's still working from the manual.</font>

327
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:13,121
<font color=#ffff00>I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.</font>

328
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:15,790
<font color=#ffff00>Oh come on.
Give him a break.</font>

329
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,090
<font color=#ffff00>Get a break.</font>

330
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,658
<font color=#ffff00>Luke?</font>

331
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:23,572
<font color=#ffff00>I appreciate that.</font>

332
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:26,863
<font color=#ffff00>- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.</font>

333
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,218
<font color=#ffff00>Rule No.1,</font>

334
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,156
<font color=#ffff00>know your audience.</font>

335
00:28:33,356 --> 00:28:35,479
<font color=#ffff00>I gave you your shot,
you shit the bed.</font>

336
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,724
<font color=#ffff00>Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.</font>

337
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,626
<font color=#ffff00>- You're dead cop!
- Dead!</font>

338
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,093
<font color=#ffff00>Well, well, well...</font>

339
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:57,772
<font color=#ffff00>Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?</font>

340
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:00,921
<font color=#ffff00>The band cop got it's day.</font>

341
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,785
<font color=#ffff00>You know,
that color looks good on you.</font>

342
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,316
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. Look a whole hell of a lot better
with your blood on it.</font>

343
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,345
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. Good luck with that, Hercules.</font>

344
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,490
<font color=#ffff00>Gone bad. Huh?</font>

345
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:24,403
<font color=#ffff00>Such a cliche.</font>

346
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,163
<font color=#ffff00>Ah well.
Welcome to the club.</font>

347
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,621
<font color=#ffff00>I wouldn't get that twisted son.</font>

348
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,857
<font color=#ffff00>We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.</font>

349
00:29:31,927 --> 00:29:33,791
<font color=#ffff00>And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.</font>

350
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,151
<font color=#ffff00>You bring the shovel did you?</font>

351
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:38,003
<font color=#ffff00>Cause it's 38 feet of
steel and concrete.</font>

352
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:40,322
<font color=#ffff00>What's up big dog?</font>

353
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,101
<font color=#ffff00>Better get to dig in.</font>

354
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:46,315
<font color=#ffff00>You wanker.</font>

355
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:08,687
<font color=#ffff00>Move..</font>

356
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:10,617
<font color=#ffff00>Say that again.</font>

357
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:15,611
<font color=#ffff00>If I say it again,
It will be to acorpse.</font>

358
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,972
<font color=#ffff00>I'm going to enjoy this.</font>

359
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:21,563
<font color=#ffff00>Welcome back, Dom.</font>

360
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,254
<font color=#ffff00>Nice job out there.</font>

361
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,122
<font color=#ffff00>Excited about tonight?</font>

362
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:28,963
<font color=#ffff00>You're going on this?</font>

363
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,068
<font color=#ffff00>You're with me Dom.</font>

364
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,137
<font color=#ffff00>- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.</font>

365
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,016
<font color=#ffff00>A pair for every occasion.</font>

366
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:56,148
<font color=#ffff00>There's enough guns here to
outfit a small army. Huh?</font>

367
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:58,617
<font color=#ffff00>Oh this is just the
tip of the iceberg.</font>

368
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,555
<font color=#ffff00>You know what I like about you, Dom.</font>

369
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:04,940
<font color=#ffff00>You're a genuine outlaw.</font>

370
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,524
<font color=#ffff00>I mean, you're a man who
lives by his own rules.</font>

371
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,559
<font color=#ffff00>Which was surprising because when I
saw you in Cuba, I heard about a</font>

372
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,315
<font color=#ffff00>guy who almost killed
you with a motorcycle and</font>

373
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:16,633
<font color=#ffff00>you.. let him keep his car?</font>

374
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,722
<font color=#ffff00>- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.</font>

375
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,658
<font color=#ffff00>Of course I could've
taken his car.</font>

376
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,503
<font color=#ffff00>But it's about something bigger.</font>

377
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:27,695
<font color=#ffff00>This way...</font>

378
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:31,167
<font color=#ffff00>I changed them.</font>

379
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:32,799
<font color=#ffff00>That's not your responsibility.</font>

380
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:34,264
<font color=#ffff00>- That's who I am.
- Is it?</font>

381
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:38,540
<font color=#ffff00>Let me ask you something Dom,
what's the best thing in your life?</font>

382
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,571
<font color=#ffff00>- Family.
- No, it's not.</font>

383
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:44,748
<font color=#ffff00>But if you're being honest?</font>

384
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,331
<font color=#ffff00>It's the 10 seconds between</font>

385
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,485
<font color=#ffff00>start and finish, when you're not
thinking about anything.</font>

386
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:54,543
<font color=#ffff00>No family,
not obligations, just you.</font>

387
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,749
<font color=#ffff00>Being free.</font>

388
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:04,683
<font color=#ffff00>I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...</font>

389
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:07,563
<font color=#ffff00>Robin Hood nonsense
you've been doing recently...</font>

390
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,530
<font color=#ffff00>It's bullshit. It's not you.</font>

391
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,569
<font color=#ffff00>Be who you are.</font>

392
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,096
<font color=#ffff00>Why live only a quarter
mile at a time,</font>

393
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,695
<font color=#ffff00>when you can live your
whole life that way?</font>

394
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:38,514
<font color=#ffff00>See all those blow that muscles
will give you.</font>

395
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,549
<font color=#ffff00>All show and no..</font>

396
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:55,987
<font color=#ffff00>Well I got plenty of goal.</font>

397
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,481
<font color=#ffff00>You must have misplaced that.</font>

398
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:00,113
<font color=#ffff00>When I kicked your ass up in
down that office of yours.</font>

399
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,555
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

400
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,015
<font color=#ffff00>Just like you Brits,
rewriting History, huh?</font>

401
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:07,500
<font color=#ffff00>All I know. It was not
me who was thrown out</font>

402
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
<font color=#ffff00>of a 4 storey window.</font>

403
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:11,669
<font color=#ffff00>Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.</font>

404
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:13,370
<font color=#ffff00>Saving my partner's life.</font>

405
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,717
<font color=#ffff00>Because where I'm from,</font>

406
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,732
<font color=#ffff00>we don't settle fight
by throwing bombs.</font>

407
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,612
<font color=#ffff00>Well, that's funny, because
where I'm from,</font>

408
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:21,276
<font color=#ffff00>we don't need women
to run to our rescue.</font>

409
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,534
<font color=#ffff00>I mean, do you really believe you
could stand in front of me?</font>

410
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,706
<font color=#ffff00>And beat me in a straight up
old fashioned fist fight?</font>

411
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,682
<font color=#ffff00>Let me tell you something.
Me and you...</font>

412
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:33,615
<font color=#ffff00>One on one, no one else around.</font>

413
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:38,647
<font color=#ffff00>I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.</font>

414
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,929
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe one day we will find that out.</font>

415
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,150
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.</font>

416
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,496
<font color=#ffff00>I said no, Mr. Nobody.</font>

417
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,529
<font color=#ffff00>I'm not leaving this cell.</font>

418
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,533
<font color=#ffff00>I'll get out my way.</font>

419
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:02,535
<font color=#ffff00>The right way.</font>

420
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,619
<font color=#ffff00>- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.</font>

421
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,541
<font color=#ffff00>- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.</font>

422
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:27,484
<font color=#ffff00>Don't let him get away.</font>

423
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,088
<font color=#ffff00><i>Hobbs!</i></font>

424
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:04,464
<font color=#ffff00>I've been waiting a
long time for this.</font>

425
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,668
<font color=#ffff00>Keep waiting bitch!</font>

426
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,512
<font color=#ffff00>Rubber bullets, big mistake.</font>

427
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,525
<font color=#ffff00>Ah, took longer than I expected.</font>

428
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:42,194
<font color=#ffff00>- 2 questions.
- Yeah.</font>

429
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,192
<font color=#ffff00>- My daughter?
- With your sister.</font>

430
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,162
<font color=#ffff00>- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.</font>

431
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,960
<font color=#ffff00>This is my new base,
welcome to Nowhere.</font>

432
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,311
<font color=#ffff00>Nice little stair for you.</font>

433
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:57,025
<font color=#ffff00>Listen, It's something I don't wanna
talk to you about...</font>

434
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,794
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, listen guys. Thanks..</font>

435
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:00,902
<font color=#ffff00>Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?</font>

436
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:02,488
<font color=#ffff00>It's called the abuse of power.</font>

437
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,269
<font color=#ffff00>You told me to round 'em up.</font>

438
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,850
<font color=#ffff00>I told you that...
hand..</font>

439
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,983
<font color=#ffff00>Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.</font>

440
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,051
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry guys, what do I have?</font>

441
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,121
<font color=#ffff00>This is how you treat old friends?</font>

442
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,820
<font color=#ffff00>Friend?</font>

443
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,386
<font color=#ffff00>We don't even really know
who the hell this guys is.</font>

444
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,987
<font color=#ffff00>It does not matter who I am,
Tez I'm like Nobody ok?</font>

445
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:19,883
<font color=#ffff00>Nobody, then who is he?</font>

446
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,826
<font color=#ffff00>He's nothing
he's like less than me.</font>

447
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,995
<font color=#ffff00>Clearly we're getting nowhere,
with nobody.</font>

448
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:28,011
<font color=#ffff00>I've been in here for 4 hours,
my ribs are sore.</font>

449
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:31,028
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know about y'all,
but I'm out.</font>

450
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,048
<font color=#ffff00>- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?</font>

451
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:35,995
<font color=#ffff00>Well,
thanks to your bust Berlin job.</font>

452
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,033
<font color=#ffff00>You all made interpol's
top 10 most wanted list.</font>

453
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:42,006
<font color=#ffff00>Top 10? Uh-huh.
That's alright.</font>

454
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,007
<font color=#ffff00>Well, not you.</font>

455
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:44,744
<font color=#ffff00>What do you mean?</font>

456
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,350
<font color=#ffff00>You just missed the cut,
you're number 11.</font>

457
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:48,773
<font color=#ffff00>- So.
- I missed it?</font>

458
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,972
<font color=#ffff00>- Yeah.
- That's impossible.</font>

459
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,170
<font color=#ffff00>What number did they come in at?</font>

460
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,181
<font color=#ffff00>Six, eight, nine...</font>

461
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:57,381
<font color=#ffff00>Ten.</font>

462
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,433
<font color=#ffff00>She's Ten? That's impossible,
there is no way she's at 10.</font>

463
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,085
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, She's definitely at 10.</font>

464
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,386
<font color=#ffff00>How about we focus
on someone who</font>

465
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,161
<font color=#ffff00>we're not gonna find out
in anybody's list?</font>

466
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,786
<font color=#ffff00>We are awaiting hard
confirmation, but...</font>

467
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:14,926
<font color=#ffff00>I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.</font>

468
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,187
<font color=#ffff00>Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.</font>

469
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:18,407
<font color=#ffff00>Not a person.</font>

470
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:19,796
<font color=#ffff00>Not according to our sources.</font>

471
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,379
<font color=#ffff00>- What does she want?
- I don't know.</font>

472
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,762
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher is like a digital active God.</font>

473
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:28,992
<font color=#ffff00>They, she, can manipulate
world systems under shadows.</font>

474
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:30,252
<font color=#ffff00>Anything that can be hacked..</font>

475
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:31,771
<font color=#ffff00>And here is the kicker.</font>

476
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,898
<font color=#ffff00>You will never find her
linked to any other.</font>

477
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:37,429
<font color=#ffff00>Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds worldwide.</font>

478
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,175
<font color=#ffff00>So basically, she
is the boogeyman.</font>

479
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:40,004
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, she is.</font>

480
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:43,024
<font color=#ffff00>One of the hottest boogeyman
I have ever seen, I mean...</font>

481
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:46,013
<font color=#ffff00>If y'all know her, tell her
to get extra boy.</font>

482
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:49,081
<font color=#ffff00>- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.</font>

483
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,717
<font color=#ffff00>Let's just say.</font>

484
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,797
<font color=#ffff00>People are scared of the
hacker group Anonymous.</font>

485
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,844
<font color=#ffff00>But even anonymous
won't mess with her.</font>

486
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,032
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?</font>

487
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:58,766
<font color=#ffff00>Probably nothing, Letty.
But...</font>

488
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,528
<font color=#ffff00>I do find it interesting,
apparently for some reason.</font>

489
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,760
<font color=#ffff00>She's now working with this guy.</font>

490
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:23,102
<font color=#ffff00>He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.</font>

491
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:24,086
<font color=#ffff00>Detonate that,</font>

492
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:27,368
<font color=#ffff00>they can turn any city in
the world into a war zone.</font>

493
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,987
<font color=#ffff00>So then what is it that
you're suggesting?</font>

494
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:31,377
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe we find Dom huh?</font>

495
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,619
<font color=#ffff00>Well, first let's catch him
and then figure out</font>

496
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:36,570
<font color=#ffff00>- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...</font>

497
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:37,703
<font color=#ffff00>To track Dom.</font>

498
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,792
<font color=#ffff00>And I know Roman,
it's kinda a big job.</font>

499
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,084
<font color=#ffff00>- It's impossible.
- Which is why...</font>

500
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:46,271
<font color=#ffff00>I'm bringing in an
extra pair of hands.</font>

501
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,814
<font color=#ffff00>Ah. My day just got a
whole hell of a lot better.</font>

502
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,001
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Nobody you want to tell me
why you just put me in a room</font>

503
00:39:57,025 --> 00:40:00,663
<font color=#ffff00>with this teen crumpeting criminal,
some bitch.</font>

504
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,854
<font color=#ffff00>You got a big mouth
on a small head.</font>

505
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,115
<font color=#ffff00>Coming from prisoner 6753.</font>

506
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,185
<font color=#ffff00>Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.</font>

507
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:09,878
<font color=#ffff00>We're not...
teaming up with this guy.</font>

508
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:10,909
<font color=#ffff00>Let's get one thing clear.</font>

509
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:14,903
<font color=#ffff00>I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...</font>

510
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:17,618
<font color=#ffff00>Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.</font>

511
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:19,667
<font color=#ffff00>You gonna do apply for a job,
Head-asshole?</font>

512
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,053
<font color=#ffff00>You don't think that tight t-shirt</font>

513
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:22,703
<font color=#ffff00>is cutting off the
circulation to your brain.</font>

514
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,967
<font color=#ffff00>You should get bigger size.</font>

515
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,802
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher came to me first.</font>

516
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,223
<font color=#ffff00>Wanted me to steal
Nightshade for her.</font>

517
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:29,899
<font color=#ffff00>When I said no,
she went off to my brother.</font>

518
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:30,886
<font color=#ffff00>Oh Yes.</font>

519
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,276
<font color=#ffff00>Brother Owen who
could forget him?</font>

520
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,805
<font color=#ffff00>Former hell-raiser
and current guest,</font>

521
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:39,133
<font color=#ffff00>at a nasty little black site prison.</font>

522
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:41,216
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher corrupted him
left him for dead.</font>

523
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,686
<font color=#ffff00>So if I get a shot to take her down,</font>

524
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,151
<font color=#ffff00>believe me, flicks
I'm taking it.</font>

525
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,515
<font color=#ffff00>You're taking my boot
right up your ass.</font>

526
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,700
<font color=#ffff00>Guys, guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.</font>

527
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:51,043
<font color=#ffff00>Now aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world,</font>

528
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:52,690
<font color=#ffff00>that have ever managed
to actually track him..</font>

529
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,666
<font color=#ffff00>Down with any success.
And guess what.</font>

530
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:57,719
<font color=#ffff00>They're both standing in front
of me right now. So like it or not,</font>

531
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,881
<font color=#ffff00>you two are gonna work together.</font>

532
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,844
<font color=#ffff00>You got that?</font>

533
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,088
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna take that as a yes.</font>

534
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,941
<font color=#ffff00>Am I the only one seeing this?</font>

535
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:10,775
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, this oughtta be good.</font>

536
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,400
<font color=#ffff00>Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..</font>

537
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:20,301
<font color=#ffff00>Running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.</font>

538
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,879
<font color=#ffff00>It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.</font>

539
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:26,931
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, that is a great idea.</font>

540
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,039
<font color=#ffff00>Did you hear that? Great idea.</font>

541
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:33,909
<font color=#ffff00>- And no, no! No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.</font>

542
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:35,112
<font color=#ffff00>Let's fire it up.. huh?</font>

543
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:47,154
<font color=#ffff00>Got him.
He's in London.</font>

544
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:56,964
<font color=#ffff00>Wait, we have got a
2nd match in Hong Kong.</font>

545
00:41:57,301 --> 00:42:00,935
<font color=#ffff00>- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.</font>

546
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,872
<font color=#ffff00>And just about every other
major city on the planet.</font>

547
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,799
<font color=#ffff00>And so...
God's eye was where we start.</font>

548
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,708
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher's already created an evasion
that masked her location by..</font>

549
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:15,052
<font color=#ffff00>Pinging random spots
all over the globe.</font>

550
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:16,936
<font color=#ffff00>But it was a good thought Roman.</font>

551
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,840
<font color=#ffff00>So she's made my
programme obsolete.</font>

552
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,037
<font color=#ffff00>And that Ramsey..</font>

553
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,948
<font color=#ffff00>- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions...</font>

554
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:25,388
<font color=#ffff00>aren't gonna cut it here slick.</font>

555
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,513
<font color=#ffff00>Why are you looking at me
when you're saying that?</font>

556
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,652
<font color=#ffff00>Wait a second, wait, wait.</font>

557
00:42:30,752 --> 00:42:32,550
<font color=#ffff00>Simple solutions might just cut it.</font>

558
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:35,727
<font color=#ffff00>In order for God's eyes to
give up all this false pings,</font>

559
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:37,960
<font color=#ffff00>Means they have to
be using a free relay.</font>

560
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,030
<font color=#ffff00>Watch these two.</font>

561
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,111
<font color=#ffff00>Which means it has a decaying
sync quantanizer.</font>

562
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,692
<font color=#ffff00>Which we can reverse.</font>

563
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:45,203
<font color=#ffff00>And track it back to
the originating source</font>

564
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,922
<font color=#ffff00>and find Dom's true location.</font>

565
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,705
<font color=#ffff00>Telling you, they got skills.</font>

566
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:50,905
<font color=#ffff00>That was my idea.</font>

567
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,113
<font color=#ffff00>That's what I was saying,
remember in there?</font>

568
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,662
<font color=#ffff00>Alright.
Let's try this.</font>

569
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:06,612
<font color=#ffff00>It's working..</font>

570
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,936
<font color=#ffff00>Time you wanna take your manual
and start organizing first response...</font>

571
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:12,148
<font color=#ffff00>Let's get a hold of
our internatio...</font>

572
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,679
<font color=#ffff00>He's still..</font>

573
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,649
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, like first baby shit.</font>

574
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:17,186
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, we've tried those location...</font>

575
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,041
<font color=#ffff00>wanna mobilize.</font>

576
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,912
<font color=#ffff00>Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.</font>

577
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:27,012
<font color=#ffff00>Get away from me.</font>

578
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,858
<font color=#ffff00>Alright they are not in China..</font>

579
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:31,927
<font color=#ffff00>Or Russia.</font>

580
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,265
<font color=#ffff00>Europe's clear.</font>

581
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,954
<font color=#ffff00>But this one's not going away.</font>

582
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:40,898
<font color=#ffff00>This is interesting.</font>

583
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,333
<font color=#ffff00>Why?</font>

584
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,068
<font color=#ffff00>Because that's here.</font>

585
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:30,262
<font color=#ffff00>Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.</font>

586
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:32,421
<font color=#ffff00>It scrambles your senses.</font>

587
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:35,329
<font color=#ffff00>Don't worry,
It'll wear off in an hour.</font>

588
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,528
<font color=#ffff00>Probably.</font>

589
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:41,428
<font color=#ffff00>Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.</font>

590
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,238
<font color=#ffff00>Look at this,
bodies not even cold Dom.</font>

591
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:49,306
<font color=#ffff00>Your family's already replacing you.</font>

592
00:44:50,476 --> 00:44:53,244
<font color=#ffff00>You chose the loosing team.</font>

593
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:56,479
<font color=#ffff00>I guess your brother
is smarter than you.</font>

594
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:33,301
<font color=#ffff00>Smart move embedding God's eye
into the mainframe.</font>

595
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:34,451
<font color=#ffff00>Irritating to make me have to come</font>

596
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:36,590
<font color=#ffff00>all the way down here to get it, but.</font>

597
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:40,807
<font color=#ffff00>Let's go.</font>

598
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:48,938
<font color=#ffff00>Dom!</font>

599
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:00,556
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna turn
your back on family?</font>

600
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:01,810
<font color=#ffff00>Just like that?</font>

601
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,003
<font color=#ffff00>Let's go.</font>

602
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:13,431
<font color=#ffff00>You okay?</font>

603
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,368
<font color=#ffff00>That wasn't him.</font>

604
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,497
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know what she's got on him.</font>

605
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,397
<font color=#ffff00>But that wasn't Dom.</font>

606
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:30,307
<font color=#ffff00>- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.</font>

607
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,507
<font color=#ffff00>We can't bring Bryan
and Mia into this.</font>

608
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,305
<font color=#ffff00>We agreed on that.</font>

609
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,444
<font color=#ffff00>I know.</font>

610
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:51,727
<font color=#ffff00>Back there was that for her,</font>

611
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:54,522
<font color=#ffff00>for me, or you?</font>

612
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:58,176
<font color=#ffff00>Or was it either necessary?</font>

613
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:00,309
<font color=#ffff00>Necessary?</font>

614
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:04,315
<font color=#ffff00>Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.</font>

615
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:07,197
<font color=#ffff00>I simply made one but so did you.</font>

616
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:09,974
<font color=#ffff00>You could have stopped me,
but you chose not to do.</font>

617
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:12,260
<font color=#ffff00>I wonder what Letty
thought about that.</font>

618
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:17,336
<font color=#ffff00>The problem of putting your foot
on a Tiger's neck...</font>

619
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:18,986
<font color=#ffff00>is you can never let it up.</font>

620
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:22,944
<font color=#ffff00>I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.</font>

621
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,171
<font color=#ffff00>Dom.</font>

622
00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:09,179
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry.</font>

623
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:13,186
<font color=#ffff00>You shoudn't have come.</font>

624
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:15,161
<font color=#ffff00>Nothing's gonna get me away.</font>

625
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:17,231
<font color=#ffff00>Now she has the three of us.</font>

626
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:25,347
<font color=#ffff00>You wanna see him?</font>

627
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:30,805
<font color=#ffff00>See papa.</font>

628
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:40,336
<font color=#ffff00>Papa.</font>

629
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,212
<font color=#ffff00>When I realized I was pregnant.</font>

630
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,383
<font color=#ffff00>You had just find out
Letty was alive.</font>

631
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:59,256
<font color=#ffff00>So I decided when Letty and you
go back from your honeymoon.</font>

632
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,359
<font color=#ffff00>I was going to tell you.</font>

633
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:06,142
<font color=#ffff00>And then she took us
before I had the chance.</font>

634
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,427
<font color=#ffff00>I call him Michaels.</font>

635
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:21,324
<font color=#ffff00>That his middle name.</font>

636
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:25,296
<font color=#ffff00>I thought his father should
give him first name.</font>

637
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,580
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry, Dom.</font>

638
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,562
<font color=#ffff00>There is nothing to be sorry for.</font>

639
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:44,727
<font color=#ffff00>Whatever happens...</font>

640
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,665
<font color=#ffff00>Just save our son.</font>

641
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,776
<font color=#ffff00>Your son.</font>

642
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:11,141
<font color=#ffff00>P s a g m e n o</font>

643
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:15,716
<font color=#ffff00>Good visit?</font>

644
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:20,849
<font color=#ffff00>I know. I know what
you're thinking.</font>

645
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:24,741
<font color=#ffff00>I just let the guards go,</font>

646
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:27,171
<font color=#ffff00>so there is only two opponents
in the room.</font>

647
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:30,862
<font color=#ffff00>Rhodes has the gun, so you'll
take him out first, I know you.</font>

648
00:51:31,808 --> 00:51:33,835
<font color=#ffff00>And then you're thinking.</font>

649
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:36,384
<font color=#ffff00>Elena is a cop,
maybe the two of you</font>

650
00:51:36,454 --> 00:51:38,613
<font color=#ffff00>can fight your way out of here.</font>

651
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,814
<font color=#ffff00>So much to think about.</font>

652
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,725
<font color=#ffff00>Let me make it easier for you.</font>

653
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,836
<font color=#ffff00>Do with it as you wish.</font>

654
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:07,660
<font color=#ffff00>Have you heard of choice theory Dom?</font>

655
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:09,043
<font color=#ffff00>There's a bunch of axiems</font>

656
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:11,726
<font color=#ffff00>but only two you really need
to concern yourself with,</font>

657
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:12,769
<font color=#ffff00>One.</font>

658
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:16,284
<font color=#ffff00>The only person's behavior
we can control is our own.</font>

659
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:20,246
<font color=#ffff00>And two, the only thing we
can truly give another person</font>

660
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:22,819
<font color=#ffff00>is information, so let me
give you some.</font>

661
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:26,374
<font color=#ffff00>You see this cameras in here?</font>

662
00:52:27,193 --> 00:52:28,461
<font color=#ffff00>The moment you make a move,</font>

663
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,475
<font color=#ffff00>highly paid men with weapons,</font>

664
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:32,075
<font color=#ffff00>will make there way into this room.</font>

665
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:35,662
<font color=#ffff00>With one very...
specific instruction.</font>

666
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,708
<font color=#ffff00>It's not to save me.</font>

667
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:41,813
<font color=#ffff00>It's to kill your son.</font>

668
00:52:42,683 --> 00:52:44,158
<font color=#ffff00>And that's a lot of bullets.</font>

669
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,656
<font color=#ffff00>And it only takes one
for you to loose everything.</font>

670
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,529
<font color=#ffff00>So, I have to ask you, because...</font>

671
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:53,889
<font color=#ffff00>I know family is so
important to you.</font>

672
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:59,642
<font color=#ffff00>Is that really a choice
you wanna make?</font>

673
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,875
<font color=#ffff00>Because I'm ready as you are.</font>

674
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,694
<font color=#ffff00>I pull this trigger, and
God knows I wanna..</font>

675
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:14,926
<font color=#ffff00>I'll kill everyone on this plane...</font>

676
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,693
<font color=#ffff00>I still couldn't get in there.</font>

677
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:21,676
<font color=#ffff00>Cause you here
manipulate this system.</font>

678
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:23,900
<font color=#ffff00>Since I'm alone!</font>

679
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:28,846
<font color=#ffff00>I got no choice!</font>

680
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:39,761
<font color=#ffff00>I don't think so.</font>

681
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,846
<font color=#ffff00>You want to see the old Dom?</font>

682
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:16,790
<font color=#ffff00>Watch.</font>

683
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,870
<font color=#ffff00>Damn it..</font>

684
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:39,572
<font color=#ffff00>She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.</font>

685
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:43,603
<font color=#ffff00>That was the one thing
we could use to find him.</font>

686
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:44,777
<font color=#ffff00>We lost everything.</font>

687
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:51,405
<font color=#ffff00>- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.</font>

688
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:53,166
<font color=#ffff00>But I've got
couple of minutes to spare.</font>

689
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,758
<font color=#ffff00>If you want me to send
you to the hospital again.</font>

690
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,496
<font color=#ffff00>- Yo Rules!
- First off,</font>

691
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:01,504
<font color=#ffff00>- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.</font>

692
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:03,432
<font color=#ffff00>- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.</font>

693
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:05,799
<font color=#ffff00>Great do me a favor, and tell
your majesty over there,</font>

694
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:08,622
<font color=#ffff00>that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.</font>

695
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:10,340
<font color=#ffff00>When this is all over,
you have me to</font>

696
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,425
<font color=#ffff00>slap that whickest biscuit
right off his face.</font>

697
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:14,852
<font color=#ffff00>Wait a minute, guys. I think
Decker's actually onto something.</font>

698
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,338
<font color=#ffff00>How do you think
Dom and Cipher got</font>

699
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,228
<font color=#ffff00>into the country
without us knowing?</font>

700
00:55:19,257 --> 00:55:21,255
<font color=#ffff00>- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft</font>

701
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:23,324
<font color=#ffff00>it was all internet
conspiracy stuff.</font>

702
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:24,393
<font color=#ffff00>It's not.</font>

703
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,955
<font color=#ffff00>Satellites and radar grids...</font>

704
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:28,991
<font color=#ffff00>All across the globe shift.</font>

705
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:32,917
<font color=#ffff00>Like an ocean. And they've got
channels that open and close.</font>

706
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:35,051
<font color=#ffff00>And theoretically, if you
know the right people who...</font>

707
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:36,069
<font color=#ffff00>Know the right patterns.</font>

708
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,332
<font color=#ffff00>You can fly right through
the blind's box...</font>

709
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,499
<font color=#ffff00>can't be intercepted.</font>

710
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:41,768
<font color=#ffff00>So you know where Dom is headed?</font>

711
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:44,759
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, New York.</font>

712
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,470
<font color=#ffff00>You see there Luke..</font>

713
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,758
<font color=#ffff00>You guys...
are gonna get along just great.</font>

714
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:53,846
<font color=#ffff00>Which proves, rule number two,
you never lose everything.</font>

715
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:55,837
<font color=#ffff00>Fire up the chopper.</font>

716
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:58,551
<font color=#ffff00>Guys, have a bowl
and a Big Apple.</font>

717
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:24,644
<font color=#ffff00>Are we travelling like this again?</font>

718
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:27,741
<font color=#ffff00>Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.</font>

719
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,665
<font color=#ffff00>But like this?</font>

720
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:36,533
<font color=#ffff00>Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...</font>

721
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:38,988
<font color=#ffff00>Let me ask you
what are we doing here?</font>

722
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:40,764
<font color=#ffff00>That's a good question, Roman.</font>

723
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,693
<font color=#ffff00>Let me show you.</font>

724
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:50,088
<font color=#ffff00>Welcome to our new
base of operations.</font>

725
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:53,212
<font color=#ffff00>Now seriously,
what is this place?</font>

726
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:56,117
<font color=#ffff00>This... is heaven.</font>

727
00:57:01,946 --> 00:57:05,105
<font color=#ffff00>The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.</font>

728
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:14,191
<font color=#ffff00>This is where we house every vehicles</font>

729
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:16,163
<font color=#ffff00>seized from drug
dealers of East coast.</font>

730
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,326
<font color=#ffff00>Now. Mr nobody said..</font>

731
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,352
<font color=#ffff00>If we're gonna have a chance
of catching Dom..</font>

732
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,146
<font color=#ffff00>We're gonna have to
be damn fast.</font>

733
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,773
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe this could help.</font>

734
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,432
<font color=#ffff00>We got a tank.
750 horsepower.</font>

735
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:38,371
<font color=#ffff00>6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.</font>

736
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:42,491
<font color=#ffff00>With the M153 probe remotely
operated weapon station on top.</font>

737
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:44,590
<font color=#ffff00>You didn't get this
from drug dealers.</font>

738
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,001
<font color=#ffff00>No. No that...</font>

739
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:48,921
<font color=#ffff00>United State's army weaponry.</font>

740
00:57:48,991 --> 00:57:50,439
<font color=#ffff00>See the army developing
machines like this</font>

741
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:53,368
<font color=#ffff00>the soldiers could drive from a
mile way so they can stay safe.</font>

742
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:56,350
<font color=#ffff00>And alive. But luckily..</font>

743
00:57:56,453 --> 00:58:00,013
<font color=#ffff00>There is a back up driver seat for
those of us who like to get more..</font>

744
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,510
<font color=#ffff00>Hands on.</font>

745
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,540
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sitting there wondering this whole time
when this thing feeling badly</font>

746
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:05,768
<font color=#ffff00>and she's getting fact.</font>

747
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:10,563
<font color=#ffff00>No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.</font>

748
00:58:15,566 --> 00:58:17,462
<font color=#ffff00>I'm in love.</font>

749
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:23,479
<font color=#ffff00>Again? No. No...
That's a million dollar show car.</font>

750
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,432
<font color=#ffff00>The point is to not draw attention.</font>

751
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,410
<font color=#ffff00>It's reverse psychology.</font>

752
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,347
<font color=#ffff00>Dom will never see it coming.</font>

753
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,541
<font color=#ffff00>It's neon orange,</font>

754
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,512
<font color=#ffff00>The international space station
would see it coming.</font>

755
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:36,994
<font color=#ffff00>Go choose anything less inspeculous.</font>

756
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,064
<font color=#ffff00>No no.</font>

757
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:41,360
<font color=#ffff00>This is ridiculous. Hey my man,
you can put that down right there.</font>

758
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,459
<font color=#ffff00>This is a gift. A real gift.</font>

759
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:44,967
<font color=#ffff00>I know what you're doing.</font>

760
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:48,258
<font color=#ffff00>I like your beard.
You're blanta.</font>

761
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:50,260
<font color=#ffff00>Black santa?</font>

762
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,315
<font color=#ffff00>No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..</font>

763
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,860
<font color=#ffff00>What are you doing?</font>

764
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:24,328
<font color=#ffff00>Engine's mis-firing,
I gotta check it out.</font>

765
00:59:24,372 --> 00:59:26,401
<font color=#ffff00>No. That's not part
of the plan, Dom.</font>

766
00:59:26,445 --> 00:59:27,345
<font color=#ffff00>Clearly..</font>

767
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:30,381
<font color=#ffff00>But unless you want the engine
to cease on the job,</font>

768
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:33,332
<font color=#ffff00>You have five minutes.</font>

769
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:46,818
<font color=#ffff00>I want another visual.</font>

770
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,825
<font color=#ffff00>I got an ATM</font>

771
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:09,186
<font color=#ffff00>I don't like this.</font>

772
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,207
<font color=#ffff00>I want to see Toretto.</font>

773
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:25,317
<font color=#ffff00>There are no more cameras.</font>

774
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:26,334
<font color=#ffff00>Then find something.</font>

775
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:29,431
<font color=#ffff00>Punch in on something reflective
A car mirror, anything..</font>

776
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:43,443
<font color=#ffff00>- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.</font>

777
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:46,425
<font color=#ffff00>You know what I'm capable of.</font>

778
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:49,597
<font color=#ffff00>It's why I'm here.</font>

779
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,608
<font color=#ffff00>I'll give you until
I finish my cup up.</font>

780
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:54,345
<font color=#ffff00>And I'm fucking thirsty.</font>

781
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:58,592
<font color=#ffff00>I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.</font>

782
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:00,701
<font color=#ffff00>Oh no.</font>

783
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:04,381
<font color=#ffff00>No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto,</font>

784
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:06,251
<font color=#ffff00>What more could you possibly want?</font>

785
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,327
<font color=#ffff00>To give you something back.</font>

786
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,984
<font color=#ffff00>Talk to me.</font>

787
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:25,311
<font color=#ffff00>Something's not right here.</font>

788
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:28,289
<font color=#ffff00>First time I saw my son...</font>

789
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,135
<font color=#ffff00>was behind a bulletproof glass.</font>

790
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:35,318
<font color=#ffff00>When he reached me,
I couldn't hold on.</font>

791
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:39,262
<font color=#ffff00>It's the worst pain
I ever felt..</font>

792
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:42,436
<font color=#ffff00>I know you know
exactly how that feels.</font>

793
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:47,184
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe we could change that..</font>

794
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:49,304
<font color=#ffff00>I think..</font>

795
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:53,361
<font color=#ffff00>You are about to suggest
something really dodgy Mr Toretto.</font>

796
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,325
<font color=#ffff00>It's why I'm here.</font>

797
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:05,245
<font color=#ffff00>Just punch in on something,
I'm not liking this.</font>

798
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,843
<font color=#ffff00>Something is not right.</font>

799
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:09,330
<font color=#ffff00>- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.</font>

800
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,667
<font color=#ffff00>- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.</font>

801
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,292
<font color=#ffff00>Captain Deckard Shaw,</font>

802
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:50,263
<font color=#ffff00>distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry</font>

803
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:53,200
<font color=#ffff00>of the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.</font>

804
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:57,362
<font color=#ffff00>His bold actions saved the lives of
hostages and his team mates.</font>

805
01:02:58,173 --> 01:03:01,204
<font color=#ffff00>Recommendation: Victoria Cross.</font>

806
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,246
<font color=#ffff00>Highest honor the British Government
has ever given.</font>

807
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:06,947
<font color=#ffff00>To a traitor.</font>

808
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,374
<font color=#ffff00>Some about this old thing just
doesn't add up to me.</font>

809
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:13,378
<font color=#ffff00>Well then don't do the same
kind of funny math,</font>

810
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:18,258
<font color=#ffff00>It says a DSS agent who has a
soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.</font>

811
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,252
<font color=#ffff00>Sound familiar huh?</font>

812
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,655
<font color=#ffff00>Wanna give me a hand?</font>

813
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,143
<font color=#ffff00>- On three?
- Yeah.</font>

814
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:34,323
<font color=#ffff00>One two..</font>

815
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:40,306
<font color=#ffff00>You know, you can tell this in
another letter..</font>

816
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,415
<font color=#ffff00>But maybe we could've caused
some serious damage.</font>

817
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:45,246
<font color=#ffff00>- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.</font>

818
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,540
<font color=#ffff00>Shame I'll have to punch you,</font>

819
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,351
<font color=#ffff00>head of defend,
when this is all over.</font>

820
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:54,164
<font color=#ffff00>Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,</font>

821
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:56,244
<font color=#ffff00>When this whole thing is over
we're gonna find a location</font>

822
01:03:56,268 --> 01:03:58,327
<font color=#ffff00>and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat.</font>

823
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:01,204
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up in your ass to brush up.</font>

824
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,007
<font color=#ffff00>Give me God's eyes.</font>

825
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:12,943
<font color=#ffff00>- God's eye active.
- Thanks.</font>

826
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:15,687
<font color=#ffff00>Let's find us some Russian.</font>

827
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:18,622
<font color=#ffff00>That spy with my little lie...</font>

<font color=#ffff00><i>Here's the latest defense report,
All the items in yesterday's meet.</i></font>

831
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:48,974
<font color=#ffff00>Upload this coordinates
to Dom's nav.</font>

832
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:49,998
<font color=#ffff00>Copy that.</font>

833
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:15,650
<font color=#ffff00>He's in the third car.</font>

834
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,713
<font color=#ffff00>It's a guard class limousine.</font>

835
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:33,727
<font color=#ffff00>Where's my team?</font>

836
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:36,024
<font color=#ffff00>- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.</font>

837
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,564
<font color=#ffff00>They are off the grid.</font>

838
01:05:37,574 --> 01:05:39,565
<font color=#ffff00>Probably just bunker down somewhere.</font>

839
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,543
<font color=#ffff00>Closing in on him.</font>

840
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:43,713
<font color=#ffff00>You guys ready?</font>

841
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,738
<font color=#ffff00>One thing I can guarantee you Dom.</font>

842
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:48,108
<font color=#ffff00>No one's ready for this.</font>

843
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,183
<font color=#ffff00>I want every with
chip with the GEODIE exploits</font>

around that motorcade now.</font>

845
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,145
<font color=#ffff00>There's over a thousands of them.</font>

846
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,890
<font color=#ffff00>Hack 'em all.</font>

847
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:14,243
<font color=#ffff00>It's zombie time.</font>

848
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:24,413
<font color=#ffff00>I'd buckle up if I were you.</font>

849
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,019
<font color=#ffff00><i>AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.</i></font>

853
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,110
<font color=#ffff00><i>What is going on?</i></font>

854
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,951
<font color=#ffff00>Ouch.</font>

<font color=#ffff00>Police escort down..</font>

857
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:12,061
<font color=#ffff00>Take out the lead and follow cars.</font>

858

Shoot their engines.</i></font>

923
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:37,682
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know why you're doing this,

926
01:19:57,644 --> 01:20:01,306

<font color=#ffff00>Okay.</font>

928

935
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:04,509
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know what it is,</font>

936
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:06,985
<font color=#ffff00>but they're building
towards something.</font>

937
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,895
<font color=#ffff00>Deckard?</font>

938
01:21:09,967 --> 01:21:10,967
<font color=#ffff00>He didn't make it.</font>

939
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,128
<font color=#ffff00>I'm disappointed in you, Dom.</font>

940
01:21:36,052 --> 01:21:38,913
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna Letty just walk
away with the codes.</font>

941
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:41,894
<font color=#ffff00>- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.</font>

942
01:21:41,928 --> 01:21:44,954
<font color=#ffff00>You made the choice
to let her go.</font>

943
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:48,090
<font color=#ffff00>And now I have to make
one on my own.</font>

944
01:22:00,044 --> 01:22:04,312
<font color=#ffff00>They are adorable little things,
aren't they?</font>

945
01:22:04,748 --> 01:22:06,407
<font color=#ffff00>I hope I don't hurt him.</font>

946
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,320
<font color=#ffff00>Look, Cipher, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.</font>

947
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,003
<font color=#ffff00>Don't do this.</font>

948
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:19,425
<font color=#ffff00>- This is your doing.
- My doing?</font>

949
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,427
<font color=#ffff00>Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.</font>

950
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:33,236
<font color=#ffff00>I don't want you to beg.</font>

951
01:22:35,642 --> 01:22:38,839
<font color=#ffff00>- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?</font>

952
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:44,738
<font color=#ffff00>I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.</font>

953
01:22:50,255 --> 01:22:51,822
<font color=#ffff00>But it was the wrong choice.</font>

954
01:22:53,123 --> 01:22:55,792
<font color=#ffff00>This is a consequence, Dom.</font>

955
01:22:57,194 --> 01:22:59,728
<font color=#ffff00>No! No! No...</font>

956
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:02,690
<font color=#ffff00>Wait. Wait.</font>

957
01:23:04,701 --> 01:23:06,692
<font color=#ffff00>No!</font>

958
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:36,591
<font color=#ffff00>Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the ally.</font>

959
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:38,824
<font color=#ffff00>- Traffic cams.
- I got you.</font>

960
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:46,703
<font color=#ffff00>I knew it.
I recognize that guy.</font>

961
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,235
<font color=#ffff00>That's Connor Rhodes.</font>

962
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:50,500
<font color=#ffff00>I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.</font>

963
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,442
<font color=#ffff00>He wanted us to get the
Nightshade device him.</font>

964
01:23:54,177 --> 01:23:55,308
<font color=#ffff00>Connor Rhodes.</font>

965
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:58,945
<font color=#ffff00>He's also linked to somebody
who I like to forget.</font>

966
01:23:58,981 --> 01:24:00,141
<font color=#ffff00>Mose Jakande.</font>

967
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:03,008
<font color=#ffff00>Warlord who tried to get God's eye.</font>

968
01:24:03,019 --> 01:24:06,352
<font color=#ffff00>Which means that's twice that
Dom has messed up Cipher's business.</font>

969
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:20,987
<font color=#ffff00>Everything you're feeling right now,</font>

970
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,002
<font color=#ffff00>that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.</font>

971
01:24:25,272 --> 01:24:29,163
<font color=#ffff00>It's a survival instinct wired
deep into our brains.</font>

972
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:32,968
<font color=#ffff00>To ensure continuation of species.</font>

973
01:24:33,078 --> 01:24:35,905
<font color=#ffff00>When early men went visit
a watering hole...</font>

974
01:24:36,914 --> 01:24:42,045
<font color=#ffff00>If they didn't watch their child,
they got snatched by a crocodile.</font>

975
01:24:42,186 --> 01:24:48,991
<font color=#ffff00>Their brains would create a painful
but a structural memory.</font>

976
01:24:49,726 --> 01:24:52,053
<font color=#ffff00>So it will never happen again.</font>

977
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:57,024
<font color=#ffff00>This idea of family
that is so core with you,</font>

978
01:24:57,032 --> 01:24:59,057
<font color=#ffff00>that rules your world...</font>

979
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:02,969
<font color=#ffff00>It's a biological lie.</font>

980
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,064
<font color=#ffff00>You don't have to accept it.</font>

981
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:09,267
<font color=#ffff00>I don't!</font>

982
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,167
<font color=#ffff00>Did you really could think
you could destroy two of my teams.</font>

983
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:17,110
<font color=#ffff00>Without any repercussions?</font>

984
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:20,263
<font color=#ffff00>I wouldn't have even
looked your way..</font>

985
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:21,851
<font color=#ffff00>If you hadn't done that.</font>

986
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:24,048
<font color=#ffff00>You didn't even know you had a kid.</font>

987
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:26,414
<font color=#ffff00>You can thank me for that.</font>

988
01:25:26,484 --> 01:25:28,891
<font color=#ffff00>And start doing the job
I'm asking you to do.</font>

989
01:25:28,893 --> 01:25:30,087
<font color=#ffff00>Help you start a war.</font>

990
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:32,096
<font color=#ffff00>Is that what you think I want.</font>

991
01:25:34,932 --> 01:25:36,991
<font color=#ffff00>That's so limited.</font>

992
01:25:37,968 --> 01:25:40,061
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't take that
football to start a war..</font>

993
01:25:40,104 --> 01:25:43,038
<font color=#ffff00>Anymore than I took your son
to start a family.</font>

994
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,932
<font color=#ffff00>Taking your son got me the codes..</font>

995
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,886
<font color=#ffff00>The codes will get me the nukes,</font>

996
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:50,343
<font color=#ffff00>and the nukes will
get me what I want...</font>

997
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:55,111
<font color=#ffff00>Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.</font>

998
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,015
<font color=#ffff00>What's that?</font>

999
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,853
<font color=#ffff00>Accountability.</font>

1000
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,018
<font color=#ffff00>The second I fire off
one of those nukes..</font>

1001
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:07,993
<font color=#ffff00>I put the superpowers of this world
on notice that...</font>

1002
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:10,052
<font color=#ffff00>when they cross the line,</font>

1003
01:26:12,432 --> 01:26:15,931
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna be there
to hold the responsible..</font>

1004
01:26:16,869 --> 01:26:18,996
<font color=#ffff00>Because the truth is, Dom...</font>

1005
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:21,096
<font color=#ffff00>To the world out there...</font>

1006
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,935
<font color=#ffff00>I'm the crocodile
at the watering hole.</font>

1007
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,366
<font color=#ffff00>You've got one last job to do.</font>

1008
01:26:36,052 --> 01:26:37,952
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher..</font>

1009
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:49,997
<font color=#ffff00>If I were you,
I would kiss my son.</font>

1010
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:55,685
<font color=#ffff00>Because whether you value it or not,
all of this...</font>

1011
01:26:56,937 --> 01:26:59,797
<font color=#ffff00>Your plane, your security and you...</font>

1012
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:03,574
<font color=#ffff00>are still on this
earth because of him.</font>

1013
01:27:09,115 --> 01:27:10,676
<font color=#ffff00>The problem we have
with tracking Cipher</font>

1014
01:27:10,716 --> 01:27:12,049
<font color=#ffff00>is there's nothing to trace then.</font>

1015
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:13,487
<font color=#ffff00>Now we have Rhodes' information.</font>

1016
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:15,514
<font color=#ffff00>And we're getting
snapshots of this data</font>

1017
01:27:15,584 --> 01:27:17,080
<font color=#ffff00>before it's scrubbed off the net.</font>

1018
01:27:17,322 --> 01:27:19,693
<font color=#ffff00>That looks like somebody's
bank accounts? Always just...</font>

1019
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,819
<font color=#ffff00>The Longitude.</font>

1020
01:27:21,926 --> 01:27:24,087
<font color=#ffff00>Given the fact that Dom
hit the Russian Motorcade</font>

1021
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:27,063
<font color=#ffff00>safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.</font>

1022
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:29,749
<font color=#ffff00>Great, let's start here
run the possibilities.</font>

1023
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:32,974
<font color=#ffff00>Yalta, Poltava.</font>

1024
01:27:33,174 --> 01:27:34,894
<font color=#ffff00>Looks like they just threw
letters together.</font>

1025
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:37,181
<font color=#ffff00>- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.</font>

1026
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:38,381
<font color=#ffff00>What are you doing here?</font>

1027
01:27:39,207 --> 01:27:41,294
<font color=#ffff00>Thought I was gonna check in on you
from time to time,</font>

1028
01:27:41,318 --> 01:27:42,379
<font color=#ffff00>To see you how you're doing.</font>

1029
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:44,076
<font color=#ffff00>By the way, not so hot.</font>

1030
01:27:44,275 --> 01:27:46,841
<font color=#ffff00>But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..</font>

1031
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:47,962
<font color=#ffff00>That funny...</font>

1032
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,447
<font color=#ffff00>Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base</font>

1033
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:52,280
<font color=#ffff00>with the retrophilic
cold war Submarines.</font>

1034
01:27:52,853 --> 01:27:55,014
<font color=#ffff00>Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.</font>

1035
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,000
<font color=#ffff00>Base was take by a terror grope
of military separatists</font>

1036
01:27:58,049 --> 01:28:00,489
<font color=#ffff00>about a month ago. And the
Russians haven't taken it back yet.</font>

1037
01:28:00,494 --> 01:28:03,020
<font color=#ffff00>So there is a little
window of opportunity here.</font>

1038
01:28:03,062 --> 01:28:05,224
<font color=#ffff00>Russian submarines,
nuclear football,</font>

1039
01:28:05,498 --> 01:28:09,023
<font color=#ffff00>it sounds like everything we do
our legs gonna be bombed off.</font>

1040
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,093
<font color=#ffff00>Sounds like you're still
a No. 11 on the list.</font>

1041
01:28:12,904 --> 01:28:15,119
<font color=#ffff00>It sounds like you've changed
since you look punk ass.</font>

1042
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:16,661
<font color=#ffff00>Facial hairs and camen.</font>

1043
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:18,612
<font color=#ffff00>Guys... guys. Hey.</font>

1044
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,288
<font color=#ffff00>We gotta call this in
all the way up the chain.</font>

1045
01:28:20,312 --> 01:28:21,412
<font color=#ffff00>That's good thinking champ.</font>

1046
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:25,274
<font color=#ffff00>Except... unfortunately the
Russian Minister of Defense.</font>

1047
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:28,170
<font color=#ffff00>Got himself involved in little
incident on US territory</font>

1048
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:30,438
<font color=#ffff00>and two governments
aren't talking to each other for a while.</font>

1049
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:32,133
<font color=#ffff00>By the time they do...
It will be too late.</font>

1050
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:33,655
<font color=#ffff00>So, any other suggestions?</font>

1051
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:36,651
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, I got one.</font>

1052
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,461
<font color=#ffff00>How about we just
stop them ourselves?</font>

1053
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,586
<font color=#ffff00>You're talking about a
Russian Military Base.</font>

1054
01:28:41,629 --> 01:28:42,561
<font color=#ffff00>Separatists.</font>

1055
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:43,935
<font color=#ffff00>Whatever. It's suicide.</font>

1056
01:28:44,035 --> 01:28:45,665
<font color=#ffff00>It's stopping world war 3.</font>

1057
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:48,899
<font color=#ffff00>What's it gonna be rook?</font>

1058
01:28:48,936 --> 01:28:50,994
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna close your eyes
on this one too?</font>

1059
01:28:51,537 --> 01:28:52,821
<font color=#ffff00>Pray that the apocalypse</font>

1060
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:55,405
<font color=#ffff00>doesn't come knocking on
your mama's front door?</font>

1061
01:28:55,408 --> 01:28:57,216
<font color=#ffff00>Or are you're gonna saddle up,</font>

1062
01:28:57,285 --> 01:29:00,228
<font color=#ffff00>be a man and save the
entire goddamn world.</font>

1063
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:09,352
<font color=#ffff00>You know, thank god
they read it out.</font>

1064
01:29:09,453 --> 01:29:10,420
<font color=#ffff00>What's that?</font>

1065
01:29:10,454 --> 01:29:12,414
<font color=#ffff00>- Rule number three.
- Which is?</font>

1066
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:14,815
<font color=#ffff00>There are no rules.</font>

1067
01:29:17,327 --> 01:29:18,727
<font color=#ffff00>What did I told you, Luke?</font>

1068
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:20,329
<font color=#ffff00>I knew he'd get in three.</font>

1069
01:29:20,829 --> 01:29:22,141
<font color=#ffff00>Areal transport leaves in an hour.</font>

1070
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:23,764
<font color=#ffff00>Take whatever vehicle you want.</font>

1071
01:29:23,766 --> 01:29:26,445
<font color=#ffff00>- All bets are off.
- All bets are off. Bets are off?</font>

1072
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:27,833
<font color=#ffff00><i>See you later...</i></font>

1073
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:55,961
<font color=#ffff00>Letty I don't like telling
you this one thing,</font>

1074
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:57,713
<font color=#ffff00>The game's changed.</font>

1075
01:29:58,074 --> 01:29:59,749
<font color=#ffff00>Before we were trying
just to catch Dom,</font>

1076
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,226
<font color=#ffff00>but now after all of this...</font>

1077
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:03,901
<font color=#ffff00>I want you to know,
if I have to...</font>

1078
01:30:04,545 --> 01:30:06,878
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna put him down..</font>

1079
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:11,847
<font color=#ffff00>Then you might have to
take us both down.</font>

1080
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:14,753
<font color=#ffff00>I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.</font>

1081
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,681
<font color=#ffff00>I come from a different
kind of lifestyle brah.</font>

1082
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:24,012
<font color=#ffff00>Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.</font>

1083
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:28,957
<font color=#ffff00>I try to take a piss,
I ain't even recognize myself.</font>

1084
01:30:29,192 --> 01:30:31,490
<font color=#ffff00>Now that's entirely too
much information.</font>

1085
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,017
<font color=#ffff00>I'm just saying.</font>

1086
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:34,643
<font color=#ffff00>Well, one thing is for sure.</font>

1087
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,785
<font color=#ffff00>Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a train</font>

1088
01:30:37,884 --> 01:30:41,389
<font color=#ffff00>cause no one will be this insane
to hit this place without a damn army.</font>

1089
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,654
<font color=#ffff00>I wouldn't be so sure about that.</font>

1090
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:46,935
<font color=#ffff00>Speak of the Devil.</font>

1091
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,336
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.</font>

1092
01:30:58,536 --> 01:30:59,536
<font color=#ffff00>400 meters to base.</font>

1093
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:02,568
<font color=#ffff00>Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.</font>

1094
01:31:14,063 --> 01:31:15,914
<font color=#ffff00><i>We have a possible
threat incoming.</i></font>

1095
01:31:15,952 --> 01:31:18,697
<font color=#ffff00><i>Raise the barricade,
As soon as possible.</i></font>

1096
01:31:36,053 --> 01:31:38,465
<font color=#ffff00><i>We've lost power,
get to your positions now.</i></font>

1097
01:31:40,065 --> 01:31:42,658
<font color=#ffff00>Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.</font>

1098
01:31:58,475 --> 01:32:00,075
<font color=#ffff00>- EMP's are charging.
- How long?</font>

1099
01:32:00,378 --> 01:32:01,378
<font color=#ffff00>60 seconds.</font>

1100
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:04,770
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, Dom,
You've one pulse left in that EMP.</font>

1101
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:07,540
<font color=#ffff00>That sub is heavily insulated.</font>

1102
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:10,421
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna need to be right
underneath it, for this thing to work.</font>

1103
01:32:34,457 --> 01:32:35,457
<font color=#ffff00>Come on.</font>

1104
01:32:35,489 --> 01:32:37,821
<font color=#ffff00><i>Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.</i></font>

1105
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:46,775
<font color=#ffff00><i>I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.</i></font>

1106
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:55,379
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, two birds with one stone.</font>

1107
01:32:55,579 --> 01:32:56,739
<font color=#ffff00>We've got control of the sub.</font>

1108
01:32:56,908 --> 01:32:58,038
<font color=#ffff00>Dom, we are good.</font>

1109
01:32:58,776 --> 01:33:00,573
<font color=#ffff00>Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...</font>

1110
01:33:00,911 --> 01:33:02,635
<font color=#ffff00>Let's take this baby for a spin.</font>

1111
01:33:08,663 --> 01:33:09,663
<font color=#ffff00>Damn!</font>

1112
01:33:09,712 --> 01:33:12,980
<font color=#ffff00>I think Cipher just rebooted
that Sub's command system.</font>

1113
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,555
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell is he talking about?</font>

1114
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,982
<font color=#ffff00>In Leyman's terms...</font>

1115
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:18,211
<font color=#ffff00>She just carjacked a submarine.</font>

1116
01:33:19,588 --> 01:33:23,181
<font color=#ffff00>We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.</font>

1117
01:33:23,823 --> 01:33:25,263
<font color=#ffff00>If you can get me
into that warehouse</font>

1118
01:33:25,592 --> 01:33:27,767
<font color=#ffff00>I can tap with network
and counter hack Cipher.</font>

1119
01:33:27,826 --> 01:33:29,185
<font color=#ffff00>Keep it from flowing into water.</font>

1120
01:33:29,226 --> 01:33:31,553
<font color=#ffff00>No, what we need to do is
get me on that sub.</font>

1121
01:33:31,728 --> 01:33:33,633
<font color=#ffff00>I find the weapon's room
and I can pull the lunch chip</font>

1122
01:33:33,657 --> 01:33:35,177
<font color=#ffff00>before she can fire
any of those nukes.</font>

1123
01:33:35,196 --> 01:33:36,196
<font color=#ffff00>That is too crazy.</font>

1124
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,760
<font color=#ffff00>- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.</font>

1125
01:34:03,612 --> 01:34:04,612
<font color=#ffff00>Knock, knock!</font>

1126
01:34:09,515 --> 01:34:11,228
<font color=#ffff00>Five vehicles just reached the base.</font>

1127
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:13,528
<font color=#ffff00>They just don't give up, do they..</font>

1128
01:34:22,656 --> 01:34:25,146
<font color=#ffff00>A'right. Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.</font>

1129
01:34:32,996 --> 01:34:34,227
<font color=#ffff00>Letty, let's roll.</font>

1130
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:37,990
<font color=#ffff00>Go, go, go, go.</font>

1131
01:35:14,485 --> 01:35:15,485
<font color=#ffff00>Change of plans, Dom.</font>

1132
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:17,882
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sending you the co-ordinates,
head there immediately.</font>

1133
01:35:18,082 --> 01:35:21,113
<font color=#ffff00>- I'm done. I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.</font>

1134
01:35:21,123 --> 01:35:25,023
<font color=#ffff00>Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes
and follow my instruction.</font>

1135
01:35:31,395 --> 01:35:32,754
<font color=#ffff00>I got you covered, go.</font>

1136
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:39,054
<font color=#ffff00>Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!</font>

1137
01:35:46,402 --> 01:35:49,184
<font color=#ffff00>Ok, how do you like this?</font>

1138
01:35:51,272 --> 01:35:54,052
<font color=#ffff00>- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.</font>

1139
01:35:58,109 --> 01:35:59,602
<font color=#ffff00>Hi Ramsey.</font>

1140
01:36:03,246 --> 01:36:04,547
<font color=#ffff00>She's regaining control.</font>

1141
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:06,034
<font color=#ffff00>Damn it, she's good.</font>

1142
01:36:47,338 --> 01:36:49,192
<font color=#ffff00>They are entering
the Weapon's room.</font>

1143
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:50,263
<font color=#ffff00>Oh that's cute.</font>

1144
01:36:56,175 --> 01:36:59,950
<font color=#ffff00>Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.</font>

1145
01:37:03,746 --> 01:37:06,789
<font color=#ffff00>Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.</font>

1146
01:37:08,869 --> 01:37:10,790
<font color=#ffff00>Ok,
now you're starting to piss me off.</font>

1147
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:28,226
<font color=#ffff00>Ramsey,
how much time we talking to you?</font>

1148
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,190
<font color=#ffff00>You're smart,
but no smart enough.</font>

1149
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:36,272
<font color=#ffff00>She's locked me out.</font>

1150
01:37:39,966 --> 01:37:42,678
<font color=#ffff00>Tez, I can't stop. Now
you're gonna have to pull that chip.</font>

1151
01:37:42,735 --> 01:37:44,496
<font color=#ffff00>I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.</font>

1152
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:46,815
<font color=#ffff00>The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip.</font>

1153
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,163
<font color=#ffff00>Tez we got no idea what the hell
we are looking for.</font>

1154
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,240
<font color=#ffff00>I got it.</font>

1155
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:59,043
<font color=#ffff00>What in the hell are you guys doing?</font>

1156
01:37:59,177 --> 01:38:01,414
<font color=#ffff00>It wasn't me, okay?</font>

1157
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:03,291
<font color=#ffff00>It will be labeled
"Guidance Go".</font>

1158
01:38:04,213 --> 01:38:06,146
<font color=#ffff00>- Ok. I got something.
- What?</font>

1159
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:09,538
<font color=#ffff00>It says haha.. slack
slack back</font>

1160
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:12,609
<font color=#ffff00>smoke, dear jack n jack.</font>

1161
01:38:12,785 --> 01:38:14,082
<font color=#ffff00>Do you understand that?</font>

1162
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,445
<font color=#ffff00>Well, nasty.</font>

1163
01:38:54,108 --> 01:38:55,972
<font color=#ffff00>Quite a show.</font>

1164
01:38:58,743 --> 01:39:00,076
<font color=#ffff00>Arming the nuke..</font>

1165
01:39:05,082 --> 01:39:07,263
<font color=#ffff00>Nuke's going hot,
she's trying to fire this thing.</font>

1166
01:39:07,463 --> 01:39:09,703
<font color=#ffff00>- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.</font>

1167
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:10,481
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, what are you seeing?</font>

1168
01:39:10,517 --> 01:39:12,798
<font color=#ffff00>- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit. I'm holding on.</font>

1169
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:15,646
<font color=#ffff00>Now we have a countdown.</font>

1170
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:21,292
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell is going on man?</font>

1171
01:39:21,524 --> 01:39:24,457
<font color=#ffff00>We are about to launch a nuclear
missile, what the hell is going on.</font>

1172
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:25,584
<font color=#ffff00>Pull the damn chip.</font>

1173
01:39:28,894 --> 01:39:31,394
<font color=#ffff00>Countdown. Countdown.
Look for a countdown.</font>

1174
01:39:31,429 --> 01:39:32,418
<font color=#ffff00>What countdown?</font>

1175
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:34,397
<font color=#ffff00>The missile needs to
activate for launch.</font>

1176
01:39:34,464 --> 01:39:36,647
<font color=#ffff00>The countdown timer
won't be in Russian.</font>

1177
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:37,557
<font color=#ffff00>The countdown.</font>

1178
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,107
<font color=#ffff00>Let's show the world
what we've got.</font>

1179
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,594
<font color=#ffff00>No. No. No.
Don't press that.</font>

1180
01:39:45,704 --> 01:39:46,704
<font color=#ffff00>I got it.</font>

1181
01:39:48,472 --> 01:39:50,530
<font color=#ffff00>Something is wrong.
It won't launch.</font>

1182
01:39:51,807 --> 01:39:53,531
<font color=#ffff00>Get that sub out of there.</font>

1183
01:39:54,074 --> 01:39:55,405
<font color=#ffff00>Now!</font>

1184
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:58,543
<font color=#ffff00>Move your ass Roman.</font>

1185
01:40:06,649 --> 01:40:07,472
<font color=#ffff00>You alright?</font>

1186
01:40:07,516 --> 01:40:10,409
<font color=#ffff00>There's nothing alright
about any of this. Let's go.</font>

1187
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:11,609
<font color=#ffff00>What about the missiles?</font>

1188
01:40:12,785 --> 01:40:14,611
<font color=#ffff00>We got the chip,
no nukes for her.</font>

1189
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,417
<font color=#ffff00>Hell yeah. Let's roll.</font>

1190
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:24,143
<font color=#ffff00>Guys we got company.
A lot of company.</font>

1191
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,067
<font color=#ffff00>Alright team, here is the plan.</font>

1192
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:32,173
<font color=#ffff00>There is a Sea lock
at the opening of the bay,</font>

1193
01:40:32,373 --> 01:40:33,554
<font color=#ffff00>We get there first, and close it,</font>

1194
01:40:33,578 --> 01:40:36,133
<font color=#ffff00>we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water.</font>

1195
01:40:36,348 --> 01:40:37,671
<font color=#ffff00>And disappearing forever.</font>

1196
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,204
<font color=#ffff00>I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.</font>

1197
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:45,043
<font color=#ffff00>10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.</font>

1198
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,382
<font color=#ffff00>What's the matter Roman,
you forgot the snow tyre?</font>

1199
01:41:00,419 --> 01:41:01,887
<font color=#ffff00>Loving that Lambo now?</font>

1200
01:41:12,287 --> 01:41:14,571
<font color=#ffff00>Alright everyone, hold you
with that launch trip later.</font>

1201
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:15,699
<font color=#ffff00>Right now I want that sub,</font>

1202
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:17,330
<font color=#ffff00>in deep water,
where no one can find it.</font>

1203
01:41:17,354 --> 01:41:19,208
<font color=#ffff00>Find me the fastest
route out of that bay.</font>

1204
01:41:19,278 --> 01:41:20,278
<font color=#ffff00>Copy that.</font>

1205
01:41:29,865 --> 01:41:31,357
<font color=#ffff00>Why are they shooting at me?</font>

1206
01:41:31,557 --> 01:41:33,549
<font color=#ffff00>I think off you're in that
orange Lamborghini I don't know.</font>

1207
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,338
<font color=#ffff00>Shut up Tez.</font>

1208
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:41,409
<font color=#ffff00>Dom.</font>

1209
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,427
<font color=#ffff00>Do you really wanna
put that car in gear?</font>

1210
01:41:45,696 --> 01:41:46,696
<font color=#ffff00>Do you?</font>

1211
01:41:50,552 --> 01:41:51,840
<font color=#ffff00>I don't think so.</font>

1212
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,124
<font color=#ffff00>They're heading for the sea lock.</font>

1213
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:54,582
<font color=#ffff00>They're trying to trap
the sub in the bay.</font>

1214
01:41:54,606 --> 01:41:56,951
<font color=#ffff00>I should have taken care of this
a long time ago.</font>

1215
01:41:57,651 --> 01:42:00,430
<font color=#ffff00>Rhodes, check his team out.</font>

1216
01:42:00,929 --> 01:42:01,934
<font color=#ffff00>I'm on it.</font>

1217
01:42:07,783 --> 01:42:09,243
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, get in front of me.</font>

1218
01:42:16,057 --> 01:42:17,393
<font color=#ffff00>Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?</font>

1219
01:42:18,926 --> 01:42:19,926
<font color=#ffff00>Now it's my turn.</font>

1220
01:42:34,141 --> 01:42:35,556
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, baby!</font>

1221
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:47,318
<font color=#ffff00>Guys,
we got snow mobile on the right.</font>

1222
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:50,915
<font color=#ffff00>They're going to flank us.</font>

1223
01:42:55,093 --> 01:42:56,958
<font color=#ffff00>No they ain't!</font>

1224
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,900
<font color=#ffff00>Oh shit!</font>

1225
01:43:17,481 --> 01:43:18,481
<font color=#ffff00>Tez!</font>

1226
01:43:18,749 --> 01:43:20,115
<font color=#ffff00>Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.</font>

1227
01:43:24,755 --> 01:43:28,185
<font color=#ffff00>I don't wanna go swimming. No!</font>

1228
01:43:32,996 --> 01:43:34,930
<font color=#ffff00>Really Tez?</font>

1229
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,833
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, No. No. No.</font>

1230
01:43:43,538 --> 01:43:44,538
<font color=#ffff00>Oh shit.</font>

1231
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:48,251
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, grab your door.</font>

1232
01:43:48,469 --> 01:43:49,469
<font color=#ffff00>Tez!</font>

1233
01:43:49,563 --> 01:43:50,811
<font color=#ffff00>Grab the door Roman.</font>

1234
01:43:51,093 --> 01:43:53,715
<font color=#ffff00>It's all gone.
Oh Shit.</font>

1235
01:44:05,769 --> 01:44:06,769
<font color=#ffff00>Roman, hang on.</font>

1236
01:44:08,234 --> 01:44:09,234
<font color=#ffff00>Tej!</font>

1237
01:44:13,069 --> 01:44:14,333
<font color=#ffff00>Get me off this thing.</font>

1238
01:44:14,806 --> 01:44:15,860
<font color=#ffff00>Tez.</font>

1239
01:44:20,306 --> 01:44:21,306
<font color=#ffff00>Come on!</font>

1240
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:38,258
<font color=#ffff00>Alright,
I've had enough of this shit!</font>

1241
01:44:52,389 --> 01:44:54,174
<font color=#ffff00>Number 11 my Ass.</font>

1242
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:59,100
<font color=#ffff00>Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.</font>

1243
01:45:13,161 --> 01:45:13,407
<font color=#ffff00>What?</font>

1244
01:45:13,477 --> 01:45:15,593
<font color=#ffff00>The pressure is on alert
in the cargo hold.</font>

1245
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:16,863
<font color=#ffff00>Drop it to 10 thousand feet.</font>

1246
01:45:18,029 --> 01:45:20,057
<font color=#ffff00>I know how much these people
mean to you.</font>

1247
01:45:20,464 --> 01:45:22,476
<font color=#ffff00>So I'll let you pick
the first target.</font>

1248
01:45:22,776 --> 01:45:24,576
<font color=#ffff00>I'm not picking target
from a mile away.</font>

1249
01:45:26,293 --> 01:45:29,158
<font color=#ffff00>I'd stand face to face,
and look 'em dead in the eye.</font>

1250
01:45:30,772 --> 01:45:31,853
<font color=#ffff00>Ok.</font>

1251
01:45:32,374 --> 01:45:34,141
<font color=#ffff00>The wife it is.</font>

1252
01:45:52,327 --> 01:45:55,579
<font color=#ffff00>Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.</font>

1253
01:45:55,996 --> 01:45:57,151
<font color=#ffff00>You don't go get any ideas.</font>

1254
01:45:57,221 --> 01:45:58,889
<font color=#ffff00>You and planes don't have a good history.</font>

1255
01:46:01,703 --> 01:46:02,703
<font color=#ffff00>No shit.</font>

1256
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:07,981
<font color=#ffff00>Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.</font>

1257
01:46:11,544 --> 01:46:13,535
<font color=#ffff00>Pull up surveillance, right now.</font>

1258
01:46:18,517 --> 01:46:19,643
<font color=#ffff00>Surprise.</font>

1259
01:46:21,553 --> 01:46:23,521
<font color=#ffff00>Pierce must be dead.</font>

1260
01:46:34,072 --> 01:46:36,619
<font color=#ffff00><i>You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.</i></font>

1261
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:38,406
<font color=#ffff00><i>No way, I'm not driving.</i></font>

1262
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:43,572
<font color=#ffff00>We have a security breach in the
cargo hold. Take care of it now.</font>

1263
01:46:48,645 --> 01:46:51,794
<font color=#ffff00>Jesus Mum, you should
pose to avoid the nerves.</font>

1264
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:53,272
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.</font>

1265
01:46:59,857 --> 01:47:01,592
<font color=#ffff00>Get to the pilot,
he's got the second key.</font>

1266
01:47:01,662 --> 01:47:02,662
<font color=#ffff00>Wait for my signal.</font>

1267
01:47:02,839 --> 01:47:04,216
<font color=#ffff00>Give Cipher my regards.</font>

1268
01:47:05,584 --> 01:47:07,363
<font color=#ffff00>Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?</font>

1269
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:21,542
<font color=#ffff00>He gave us this little thing here.</font>

1270
01:47:21,742 --> 01:47:23,476
<font color=#ffff00>No, don't touch.</font>

1271
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:25,000
<font color=#ffff00>You can track Cipher with this,</font>

1272
01:47:25,099 --> 01:47:28,324
<font color=#ffff00>but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.</font>

1273
01:47:28,426 --> 01:47:30,432
<font color=#ffff00>Fine, I got contacts.</font>

1274
01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:32,986
<font color=#ffff00>Now you're gonna take your brother.</font>

1275
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,321
<font color=#ffff00>- No.
- Yes.</font>

1276
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:39,585
<font color=#ffff00>Torretto knows where he is...</font>

1277
01:47:40,393 --> 01:47:41,249
<font color=#ffff00>He's got this thing.</font>

1278
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:44,530
<font color=#ffff00>He can see everything it's like it's
called the devil's bumhole or something?</font>

1279
01:47:44,531 --> 01:47:47,625
<font color=#ffff00>- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well. Whatever.</font>

1280
01:47:49,068 --> 01:47:51,595
<font color=#ffff00>There's no way
I'm using Owen, alright?</font>

1281
01:47:51,704 --> 01:47:53,462
<font color=#ffff00>He's a lost cause.</font>

1282
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,566
<font color=#ffff00>He's your brother, Deck.</font>

1283
01:47:55,608 --> 01:47:59,476
<font color=#ffff00>He's my son.
He's our family.</font>

1284
01:47:59,612 --> 01:48:01,480
<font color=#ffff00>And our family that died...</font>

1285
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,241
<font color=#ffff00>Bloody shit happening.</font>

1286
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:06,492
<font color=#ffff00>You lied about, I mean,
I can't believe you.</font>

1287
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:09,392
<font color=#ffff00>You've gotten upset,
you really upset your mother.</font>

1288
01:48:09,654 --> 01:48:11,045
<font color=#ffff00>Call yourself a brother?</font>

1289
01:48:11,122 --> 01:48:13,490
<font color=#ffff00>Look, I'm in, mum. Ok.</font>

1290
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:16,660
<font color=#ffff00>Every time!</font>

1291
01:48:21,665 --> 01:48:23,190
<font color=#ffff00>- Owen.
- In position.</font>

1292
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:26,850
<font color=#ffff00>Go.</font>

1293
01:48:28,038 --> 01:48:29,130
<font color=#ffff00>I'm in.</font>

1294
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:49,590
<font color=#ffff00>I've got the package to lay on.</font>

1295
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:51,758
<font color=#ffff00>Whole pounds of him..</font>

1296
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:13,588
<font color=#ffff00>You made me miss my son?</font>

1297
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:15,841
<font color=#ffff00>What do you think you're doing?</font>

1298
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:20,776
<font color=#ffff00>Looking at you dead in the eye.</font>

1299
01:49:43,308 --> 01:49:44,358
<font color=#ffff00>That was for Letty.</font>

1300
01:49:49,114 --> 01:49:51,726
<font color=#ffff00>- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.</font>

1301
01:49:52,551 --> 01:49:54,741
<font color=#ffff00>Rhodes picked the wrong target.</font>

1302
01:49:55,853 --> 01:49:56,856
<font color=#ffff00>Congratulations Dom.</font>

1303
01:49:58,332 --> 01:49:59,332
<font color=#ffff00>You just killed your son.</font>

1304
01:49:59,823 --> 01:50:00,823
<font color=#ffff00>You are wrong.</font>

1305
01:50:00,858 --> 01:50:02,108
<font color=#ffff00>I just saved him.</font>

1306
01:50:03,361 --> 01:50:05,820
<font color=#ffff00>And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.</font>

1307
01:50:13,803 --> 01:50:16,795
<font color=#ffff00>You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.</font>

1308
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,705
<font color=#ffff00>This is for your relief.</font>

1309
01:50:24,814 --> 01:50:25,814
<font color=#ffff00>Good?</font>

1310
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:29,743
<font color=#ffff00>Let's go.</font>

1311
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:35,722
<font color=#ffff00>Go stop him, do not let him
get off this plane.</font>

1312
01:50:39,323 --> 01:50:41,363
<font color=#ffff00>That truck's got enough munition
to take us all out.</font>

1313
01:50:41,829 --> 01:50:42,849
<font color=#ffff00>We don't give 'em a target.</font>

1314
01:50:42,873 --> 01:50:44,313
<font color=#ffff00>Everybody get in
front of us, line up</font>

1315
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,799
<font color=#ffff00>- we will take the hit.
- What?</font>

1316
01:50:46,233 --> 01:50:47,861
<font color=#ffff00>I need to switch cars, right now.</font>

1317
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:06,437
<font color=#ffff00>- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?</font>

1318
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:15,153
<font color=#ffff00>Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.</font>

1319
01:51:15,661 --> 01:51:18,218
<font color=#ffff00>It's easy for you to say,
when your ass ain't on fire.</font>

1320
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:25,208
<font color=#ffff00>Alright little mate.</font>

1321
01:51:25,637 --> 01:51:26,797
<font color=#ffff00>It's might be a little scary,</font>

1322
01:51:27,799 --> 01:51:29,265
<font color=#ffff00>It's gonna be a lot of fun.</font>

1323
01:51:40,685 --> 01:51:42,550
<font color=#ffff00>The music good?</font>

1324
01:51:55,699 --> 01:51:56,723
<font color=#ffff00>They're locking on.</font>

1325
01:51:56,767 --> 01:51:58,128
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry guys,
I got no trick for us..</font>

1326
01:51:58,368 --> 01:52:00,364
<font color=#ffff00>- What do we do now?
- We start praying.</font>

1327
01:52:23,692 --> 01:52:24,692
<font color=#ffff00>Hell yeah!</font>

1328
01:52:37,138 --> 01:52:38,138
<font color=#ffff00>That's Dom!</font>

1329
01:52:42,243 --> 01:52:44,627
<font color=#ffff00>- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?</font>

1330
01:52:44,697 --> 01:52:45,996
<font color=#ffff00>He just saved our asses.</font>

1331
01:52:49,449 --> 01:52:51,710
<font color=#ffff00>Good to be riding
with you again man.</font>

1332
01:53:04,663 --> 01:53:06,183
<font color=#ffff00>Torretto just cleared the way
for them.</font>

1333
01:53:06,323 --> 01:53:07,672
<font color=#ffff00>Someone give me something.</font>

1334
01:53:07,872 --> 01:53:09,758
<font color=#ffff00>- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.</font>

1335
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:29,880
<font color=#ffff00>- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.</font>

1336
01:53:29,902 --> 01:53:33,110
<font color=#ffff00>- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?</font>

1337
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,716
<font color=#ffff00>- This is crazy!
- Speed up,</font>

1338
01:53:39,997 --> 01:53:42,022
<font color=#ffff00>- Left and back!
- What?</font>

1339
01:53:42,032 --> 01:53:45,001
<font color=#ffff00>Turn the goddamn wheel to the left,
really quickly.</font>

1340
01:53:51,007 --> 01:53:52,133
<font color=#ffff00>Boom, baby!</font>

1341
01:53:59,248 --> 01:54:00,248
<font color=#ffff00>That's alright!</font>

1342
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:07,153
<font color=#ffff00>Back in the sink.</font>

1343
01:54:22,036 --> 01:54:23,099
<font color=#ffff00>Where is that smile?</font>

1344
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,096
<font color=#ffff00>There it is!</font>

1345
01:54:30,678 --> 01:54:34,600
<font color=#ffff00>You're gonna shoot a baby
You shoud bust it...</font>

1346
01:54:36,015 --> 01:54:37,336
<font color=#ffff00>You aren't gonna wanna see this?</font>

1347
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:51,629
<font color=#ffff00>Is that you or him?</font>

1348
01:54:54,866 --> 01:54:55,963
<font color=#ffff00>Him.
Good.</font>

1349
01:54:56,701 --> 01:54:57,701
<font color=#ffff00>The torpedo's missed,</font>

1350
01:54:57,767 --> 01:54:59,853
<font color=#ffff00>they are gonna reach lock
before the sub does.</font>

1351
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:01,698
<font color=#ffff00>The hell they are.</font>

1352
01:55:04,042 --> 01:55:05,736
<font color=#ffff00>Get ready for this.</font>

1353
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:26,593
<font color=#ffff00>Oh shit!</font>

1354
01:55:26,596 --> 01:55:28,587
<font color=#ffff00>We're going to
need a bigger truck.</font>

1355
01:55:53,456 --> 01:55:56,349
<font color=#ffff00>- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?</font>

1356
01:56:00,127 --> 01:56:02,662
<font color=#ffff00>- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!</font>

1357
01:56:08,736 --> 01:56:10,600
<font color=#ffff00>That's not good.</font>

1358
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:13,539
<font color=#ffff00>That's not good.</font>

1359
01:56:19,145 --> 01:56:20,508
<font color=#ffff00>We got this.</font>

1360
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:34,625
<font color=#ffff00>That's my girl.</font>

1361
01:56:40,632 --> 01:56:41,474
<font color=#ffff00>The sub's too close.</font>

1362
01:56:41,544 --> 01:56:43,600
<font color=#ffff00>We ain't making it
to the gate in time.</font>

1363
01:56:43,601 --> 01:56:44,801
<font color=#ffff00>We just gonna let it get away?</font>

1364
01:56:45,036 --> 01:56:46,331
<font color=#ffff00>Not if I know Dom.</font>

1365
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:52,702
<font color=#ffff00>You loose. Dom.</font>

1366
01:56:53,044 --> 01:56:54,738
<font color=#ffff00>I destroyed two of your teams</font>

1367
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:57,570
<font color=#ffff00>I killed your red headed boyfriend.</font>

1368
01:56:57,747 --> 01:57:00,974
<font color=#ffff00>And I put two killers on you
untraceable plane.</font>

1369
01:57:02,419 --> 01:57:04,991
<font color=#ffff00>You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.</font>

1370
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:10,549
<font color=#ffff00>Put a heat-seeker on him now.</font>

1371
01:57:12,528 --> 01:57:13,688
<font color=#ffff00>Now!</font>

1372
01:57:24,606 --> 01:57:27,097
<font color=#ffff00>That's a goddamn heat seeker
coming at us.</font>

1373
01:57:38,118 --> 01:57:41,080
<font color=#ffff00>Oh my...
come and get it.</font>

1374
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:04,117
<font color=#ffff00>Guys!
Dive..</font>

1375
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:08,074
<font color=#ffff00>This... This is for my son!</font>

1376
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:27,875
<font color=#ffff00>Dom!</font>

1377
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:31,668
<font color=#ffff00>You are out of bullets Deckard.</font>

1378
01:59:31,825 --> 01:59:35,093
<font color=#ffff00>Like I'm need a gun
to take care of you,</font>

1379
01:59:36,195 --> 01:59:37,219
<font color=#ffff00>How did you find me?</font>

1380
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:42,822
<font color=#ffff00>You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!</font>

1381
01:59:46,305 --> 01:59:47,956
<font color=#ffff00>Resourceful.</font>

1382
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:50,043
<font color=#ffff00>You have a lot to answer Cipher.</font>

1383
01:59:51,249 --> 01:59:52,649
<font color=#ffff00>You pulled my family through.</font>

1384
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:54,669
<font color=#ffff00>A mother.</font>

1385
01:59:56,548 --> 01:59:58,539
<font color=#ffff00>I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.</font>

1386
01:59:58,784 --> 02:00:00,547
<font color=#ffff00>To anyone.</font>

1387
02:00:00,852 --> 02:00:03,292
<font color=#ffff00>There is only one
flaw in your plan.</font>

1388
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:04,645
<font color=#ffff00>What's that?</font>

1389
02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,646
<font color=#ffff00>Only one of us has a parachute!</font>

1390
02:00:29,812 --> 02:00:31,346
<font color=#ffff00>Told you this would be fun!</font>

1391
02:00:35,251 --> 02:00:37,115
<font color=#ffff00>Time to land, Boys!</font>

1392
02:00:47,128 --> 02:00:48,544
<font color=#ffff00>You know I've never left you, Letty?</font>

1393
02:00:48,568 --> 02:00:49,568
<font color=#ffff00>I know.</font>

1394
02:00:50,398 --> 02:00:52,297
<font color=#ffff00>And you know I never will..</font>

1395
02:00:54,301 --> 02:00:55,393
<font color=#ffff00>I know.</font>

1396
02:01:04,879 --> 02:01:07,304
<font color=#ffff00>I've so much to tell you.</font>

1397
02:01:07,948 --> 02:01:11,025
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah you do,
and you can start with that bitch!</font>

1398
02:01:16,122 --> 02:01:20,258
<font color=#ffff00>Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.</font>

1399
02:01:21,427 --> 02:01:25,192
<font color=#ffff00>Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?</font>

1400
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,535
<font color=#ffff00>We need to get up out of here.</font>

1401
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:30,108
<font color=#ffff00>Cause this all kinda neuclearism
happening under this ice.</font>

1402
02:01:30,369 --> 02:01:33,391
<font color=#ffff00>Relax! Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.</font>

1403
02:01:34,106 --> 02:01:35,364
<font color=#ffff00>Ok. So we good then.</font>

1404
02:01:35,841 --> 02:01:38,368
<font color=#ffff00>Lemme go and get my
young selfie levels up.</font>

1405
02:01:39,377 --> 02:01:41,368
<font color=#ffff00>You realize this is classified, right?</font>

1406
02:01:41,412 --> 02:01:43,209
<font color=#ffff00>Not today.</font>

1407
02:01:46,217 --> 02:01:48,254
<font color=#ffff00>We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.</font>

1408
02:02:16,412 --> 02:02:17,541
<font color=#ffff00>It's Okay.</font>

1409
02:02:18,314 --> 02:02:19,754
<font color=#ffff00>Don't worry,
he's gonna be here soon.</font>

1410
02:02:20,617 --> 02:02:22,551
<font color=#ffff00>I get it, y'all got a lot in common.</font>

1411
02:02:22,552 --> 02:02:25,035
<font color=#ffff00>Computer hacks,
god's eyes, geeks, nerd.</font>

1412
02:02:25,212 --> 02:02:27,798
<font color=#ffff00>You know, but we got a
lot in common too! Alright?</font>

1413
02:02:27,898 --> 02:02:29,628
<font color=#ffff00>- Like what?
- We walk in the room,</font>

1414
02:02:30,024 --> 02:02:31,951
<font color=#ffff00>and we are oozing sex appeal.</font>

1415
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:34,245
<font color=#ffff00>Me and you?
There's a problem.</font>

1416
02:02:34,445 --> 02:02:36,523
<font color=#ffff00>I am asking the real
question right now.</font>

1417
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:38,408
<font color=#ffff00>Is it gonna be...</font>

1418
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:43,484
<font color=#ffff00>the Nerd or...
the dark knight?</font>

1419
02:02:44,672 --> 02:02:46,537
<font color=#ffff00>To be honest I like both of you.</font>

1420
02:02:46,674 --> 02:02:49,666
<font color=#ffff00>A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!</font>

1421
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:52,433
<font color=#ffff00>But just before we
get into all of that,</font>

1422
02:02:52,852 --> 02:02:54,951
<font color=#ffff00>Let me ask you one question.</font>

1423
02:02:55,151 --> 02:02:57,674
<font color=#ffff00>- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.</font>

1424
02:02:57,984 --> 02:02:59,451
<font color=#ffff00>What's my last name?</font>

1425
02:03:01,721 --> 02:03:05,602
<font color=#ffff00>When you guys pick around with then
I guess you can let me know.</font>

1426
02:03:05,802 --> 02:03:08,780
<font color=#ffff00>It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.</font>

1427
02:03:08,803 --> 02:03:09,886
<font color=#ffff00>Jones, Miss Parker.</font>

1428
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:12,001
<font color=#ffff00>Hey Miss Parker.</font>

1429
02:03:12,954 --> 02:03:14,418
<font color=#ffff00>- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

1430
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:16,634
<font color=#ffff00>I wanted to thank you.</font>

1431
02:03:17,402 --> 02:03:18,402
<font color=#ffff00>No need.</font>

1432
02:03:21,156 --> 02:03:22,042
<font color=#ffff00>Cipher's still on the loose.</font>

1433
02:03:22,112 --> 02:03:23,631
<font color=#ffff00>There's been some
reports she's in Athens.</font>

1434
02:03:23,655 --> 02:03:26,144
<font color=#ffff00>But she won't be
nuking any city anytime soon.</font>

1435
02:03:26,344 --> 02:03:27,319
<font color=#ffff00>Thanks to you guys.</font>

1436
02:03:27,362 --> 02:03:30,673
<font color=#ffff00>- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...</font>

1437
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:35,261
<font color=#ffff00>Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement. You got you job back.</font>

1438
02:03:35,302 --> 02:03:36,775
<font color=#ffff00>That is if you want it.</font>

1439
02:03:40,274 --> 02:03:41,397
<font color=#ffff00>If I want?</font>

1440
02:03:49,249 --> 02:03:51,240
<font color=#ffff00>You know after 16 years.</font>

1441
02:03:52,218 --> 02:03:53,880
<font color=#ffff00>I figured it's time
for a little break.</font>

1442
02:03:53,950 --> 02:03:54,950
<font color=#ffff00>Wow.</font>

1443
02:03:56,322 --> 02:03:58,290
<font color=#ffff00>Daddy's stayin' home.</font>

1444
02:04:05,197 --> 02:04:07,290
<font color=#ffff00>- Nobody.
- Get in touch!</font>

1445
02:04:07,533 --> 02:04:09,293
<font color=#ffff00>Ah, hang on a second.</font>

1446
02:04:09,635 --> 02:04:11,295
<font color=#ffff00>This could be interesting.</font>

1447
02:04:16,408 --> 02:04:18,327
<font color=#ffff00>What made you think
I would do it?</font>

1448
02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:22,445
<font color=#ffff00>Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.</font>

1449
02:04:22,545 --> 02:04:24,246
<font color=#ffff00>I knew you wanted revenge.</font>

1450
02:04:24,315 --> 02:04:25,503
<font color=#ffff00>Glad I did it.</font>

1451
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,134
<font color=#ffff00>Can't believe you
went to see my Mother.</font>

1452
02:04:41,231 --> 02:04:42,290
<font color=#ffff00>Come on.</font>

1453
02:04:47,236 --> 02:04:48,760
<font color=#ffff00>All this fuss of you.</font>

1454
02:04:55,077 --> 02:04:56,237
<font color=#ffff00>Yes.</font>

1455
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:04,287
<font color=#ffff00>Alena,
I promise to keep our son safe.</font>

1456
02:05:06,826 --> 02:05:08,435
<font color=#ffff00>And now.. he always will be.</font>

1457
02:05:17,231 --> 02:05:19,222
<font color=#ffff00>I want to introduce
you to the most</font>

1458
02:05:19,292 --> 02:05:21,114
<font color=#ffff00>important person in my universe.</font>

1459
02:05:22,736 --> 02:05:25,203
<font color=#ffff00>Who will never give up on me.</font>

1460
02:05:33,981 --> 02:05:35,140
<font color=#ffff00>You've heard me say.</font>

1461
02:05:35,902 --> 02:05:38,210
<font color=#ffff00>"That you never turn
your back on family."</font>
