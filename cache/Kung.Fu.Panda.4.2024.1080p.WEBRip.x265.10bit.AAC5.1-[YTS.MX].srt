the "skadoosh"?

180
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,159
You know what I mean?
The "shasha-booie"?

181
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,831
I don't want to seem ungrateful,
but I don't know

182

anything about passing on wisdom
or inspiring hope.

183
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,396
All I know are two things:

184
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:30,674
kicking butt and taking names.

185
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,137
And if I'm being
completely honest,

186
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,875
I'm not even that good
at the name-taking.

187
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,042

fire-breathing crocodile?

You were chosen to bring peace
to the valley.

190
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,751
And there are other ways
to bring peace

191
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:44,215
than simply kicking butt.

192
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,558

00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,841
But I never forget.

534
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,239
You might say
I have the memory...

535
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:05,449
Oh, don't say it.

536
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,583
...of an elephant.

537
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,247
(grunting)

538
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,462
(deep grunting)

539
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,761
(trumpets)

540
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,093
(bosses gasping)

541
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:26,602
(deep voice): You think
I've pushed you too far?

542
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,297
Then you, my friend, can't begin

543
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:30,606
-to fathom...
-(grunts)

544
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:34,610
...just how far I can push.

545
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,777
(exclaims, grunting)

546
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:40,308
(bosses whimpering, muttering)

547
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:43,784
(normal voice): I'll expect
your tributes by dawn.

548
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,315
(birds chirping)

549
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,790
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

550
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,759
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

551
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:54,630
But it does take the occasional
time-out for snackage.

552
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,258
Want to split my almond cookie?

553
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:58,392
You're just gonna give me
half of your cookie

554
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,504
-out of the goodness
of your heart?
-Mm-hmm.

555
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,330
What's the catch,
the rub, the bamboozle?

556
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,002
-The "bam-what-le"?
-You know, the fleece,

557
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:05,399
the rook, the flimflam.

558
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,940
Do you want the cookie or not?

559
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,777
(chewing noisily)

560
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:13,176
(mouth full):
I got my eye on you.

561
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,850
How much farther is it
to this The Chameleon?

562
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:18,687
Just a little farther.

563
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,953
♪ ♪

564
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:26,794
(crickets chirping)

565
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,031
(both screaming)

566
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:36,606
Li, what are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

567
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,939
Well, I... I-I didn't want
to miss the blood moon rising.

568
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,006
Oh, pooh.

569
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,041
You are just as worried as I am.

570
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:44,647
All right, all right.

571
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,375
I know pandas come across
as calm, gentle and chill,

572
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,619
but (chuckles) the truth is

573
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,149
-I'm kind of freaking out!
-So am I.

574
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,788
Po is just too calm,
gentle and chill

575
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:56,527
to face
a shape-shifting sorceress.

576
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,453
-What if he's captured?
-What if he's tortured? (gasps)

577
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:01,532
BOTH:
Our baby!

578
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:03,666
Okay, okay.

579
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,899
Maybe Po has
finally met his match,

580
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,462
but there is still something
that he has

581
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:10,904
-that The Chameleon does not.
-What's that?

582
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,235
Us.

583
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,172
Now, let's go find our son.

584
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,470
I hope Po's okay.

585
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:19,341
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

586
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:22,476
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

587
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,016
LI:
Who was that idiot?

588
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:26,348
PING: Me, of course.
I was the wise goose.

589
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:27,690
LI:
Oh, yeah.

590
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,022
PO:
Whoa!

591
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,222
That's the biggest village
I've ever seen.

592
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:33,927
ZHEN:
That's no village.

593
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:35,995
That's Juniper City.

594
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,898
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

595
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,427
Just a boat ride away.

596
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:41,902
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

597
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:43,871
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

598
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,334
For the right price,
those cutthroats

599
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,742
will take us anywhere
we want to go.

600
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:48,777
Of course,
we could always opt for

601
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:50,614
the four-finger discount.

602
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,044
No stealing.

603
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:54,343
"The Happy Bunny Tavern."

604
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,246
Well, that sounds inviting.

605
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,215
(screams, grunts)

606
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,923
Anybody lose a rabbit?

607
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,024
(whimpers)

608
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,762
(patrons murmuring)

609
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,632
(groaning)

610
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:11,129
-Stir faster!
-(gasps)

611
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:16,101
Welcome to
the Happy Bunny Tavern.

612
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:19,302
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

613
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,304
And stay out of trouble.

614
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,077
Hey, what you guys playing?

615
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:26,276
Mah-jongg.

616
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,948
And the stakes are high.

617
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:29,653
Can I play?
Surely you'll go easy

618
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,447
on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

619
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:34,119
(snickers)

620
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:35,659
Hey there.

621
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,090
-What can I get you?
-A boat ride to Juniper City.

622
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,454
Ask this guy.

623
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,832
-Who's he?
-He's the captain.

624
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,460
Thanks.

625
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:48,903
(sighs)

626
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,301
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

627
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:52,775
Never played before, huh?

628
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,074
I'm sorry, are you
accusing me of cheating?

629
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,472
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

630
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,947
I am the manager.

631
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:01,575
I'll give you a boat ride
to Juniper City,

632
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,182
but I won't carry
anything illegal.

633
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,579
I don't want any trouble.

634
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:07,515
(chuckles) Trouble runs from me.

635
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,253
-(squawks)
-Then it'll cost you double.

636
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:11,519
I'm confused. Should I have
said that I like trouble?

637
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:13,356
In that case,
it'll cost you triple.

638
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:16,029
Oh, uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price.

639
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:20,462
You got a deal.

640
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:23,432
Great. Do I shake his hand
or your hand?

641
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,808
Can I get anything else
for you, ma'am?

642
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,304
Yes. Everything, again.

643
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:29,339
Except for the broth.
It was very bland.

644
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:31,176
-Keep stirring!
-(screams)

645
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:32,540
(whimpers)

646
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:35,686
Whoa! One of everything
is my go-to order.

647
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,149
But how did you pay for this?

648
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,019
Legally, lawfully,
fair and square.

649
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:40,823
-I'm proud of you.
-(grunts)

650
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:44,387
-(gasping)
-(snorts)

651
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,225
(Zhen gasps)

652
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:50,162
(growling)

653
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,230
Oh, wow. Look at the time.

654
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,704
Remember we have to do
that thing

655
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,563
-down by the place
with that guy?
-(grunts)

656
00:27:55,598 --> 00:28:00,073
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

657
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:01,371
(gulps) There's got to be

658
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:03,208
some sort of
misunderstanding here.

659
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,748
(growling)

660
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,410
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

661
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:10,677
Please allow us to pay
for our meal and yours, too.

662
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:12,679
I'm only hungry for...

663
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,153
-Dumplings?
-...vengeance.

664
00:28:14,188 --> 00:28:16,056
Well, then, come and get it.

665
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:18,091
No! No, no, no, no!
Don't come and get it!

666
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:20,863
-Destroy them!
-(shouting)

667
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:22,590
(grunting)

668
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:32,776
(screaming)

669
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,876
I got it!

670
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,540
(grunts) Hi-yah!

671
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:45,085
-Whoa!
-There you go.

672
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,186
(grunts, exclaims)

673
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:48,792
-All better.
-(screams)

674
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,057
Come on.

675
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,421
Gotcha.

676
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,720
-Keep stirring!
-(whimpers)

677
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:56,063
(grunting)

678
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,066
(high-pitched scream)

679
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:03,004
Hi-yah!

680
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,907
(shouts)

681
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:07,943
(henchman groans)

682
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:10,176
(exclaims)

683
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,673
Whoa! (screams)

684
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,787
(clamoring)

685
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,156
I'll take that.

686
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,589
Think this belongs to you.

687
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:31,428
(growling)

688
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:32,660
Hi-yah!

689
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,972
(coins clinking)

690
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:41,911
No stealing. (exclaims)

691
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,847
(grunts, screams)

692
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,444
(sighs)

693
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,083
Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

694
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:51,349
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

695
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:52,988
-(groans)
-Get them!

696
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:54,891
-(gasps) Watch out!
-Whoa!

697
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,454
HENCHMEN:
Huh?

698
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,227
(exclaiming)

699
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:03,966
-Skadoosh!
-(roaring)

700
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,660
(henchmen shouting)

701
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,843
-(henchmen groaning)
-ZHEN: Whoa. Nice move.

702
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,174
You got to teach me that.

703
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,374
GRANNY BOAR:
You die, panda!

704
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,145

(yelling)

706
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,481
(grunts)

707
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:27,187
(screaming)

708
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,651
(screams)

709
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,191
(grunts)

710

Why, she could be anywhere.
Anyone.

727

Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

728
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:15,829
I'm sorry, but bravery was
never really my specialty.

(quacks)
You don't have to be brave.

730
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:20,537
You just have to act brave.

731
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:22,704
Act brave. Got it.

-It's all been for nothing!
-Please, no!

Does your family
live there, too?

744
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:55,638
They would if I had a family.

745

Well, I mean, I was.

752
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,498
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later,

753

put a roof over my head,

00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:33,841
gave me clothes to wear,
food to eat.

759
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:36,250

I was never alone again.

00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,992
Wait, what's your way?
(screaming)

888
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:53,831
(grunts) Sorry.

889
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,131
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

890
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,770
You can't run away from the law.

891
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:00,343
You're a wanted criminal.

892
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,642
Yeah, well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

893
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:05,007
Wow, city life
really is fast-paced.

894
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,976
We got to get out of here
before they call for...

895
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,649
(rumbling)

896
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:10,650

(growling)

898
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:16,689
That's a lot of bull.

899
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,493
-Run!
-(exclaims)

900
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:22,288

00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:26,501

00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:48,952
-Whoa!

00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:16,012
I'm falling... very slowly.

right off ya,

959
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,627
So you're friends
with all these people?

960
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:07,629
They're practically family.

961
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:08,993
Zhen.

962
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:15,670
Oh! Is that really you?

963
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:18,134
Han, my old mentor.

964
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:20,202
I always knew someday
you'll find your way home

965
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:22,545
back to the den.
And when you did...

966
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,140
(thieves growling)

967
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:27,176
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

968
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:29,310
-Family, huh?
-More like distant cousins.

969
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,686
All right,
how should we do this?

970
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,953
Quick and painless
or slow and painful?

971
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:38,121
(cheerily): Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

972
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,124
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

973
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,631
-Yay!
-Hooray!

974
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,325
You really don't want
to do this.

975
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,195
-And why is that?
-Because if you so much as

976
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,737
lay one claw on me, you're
gonna have to answer to...

977
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:51,299
the Dragon Warrior.

978
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:53,675
(imitating echo):
Warrior. Warrior. Warrior.

979
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,743
Warrior. Warrior.

980
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:56,975
Who?

981
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,647
(confused chatter)

982
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,585
Oh, man, are my adventures
really that regional?

983
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,752
Introduce them, Po.

984
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:07,084
To your fists.

985
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,921
(thieves growling)

986
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,058
Remember, Po,
there are other ways

987
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:16,258
to bring peace
than by kicking butt.

988
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:17,732
Ah, come on. Really?

989
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:20,031
-Now?
-Yes, now.

990
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:23,573
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner
Shifus have differing opinions?

991
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,937
We are in total agreement.

992
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,939
With our mutual disappointment.

993
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:28,644
BOTH:
In you.

994
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,009
Wait.

995
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,208
(murmuring)

996
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:36,718
He who resorts
to violence now...

997
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:40,183
will only find
more violence later.

998
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:42,350
(confused murmuring)

999
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:45,221
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen

1000
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:46,629
a little now...

1001
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,631
We can hurt her a lot later.

1002
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,457
What?
No, that's not what I said.

1003
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:52,459
Yes! And more violence later

1004
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:55,033
is better than
less violence now.

1005
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:57,398
No, no,
I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of what...

1006
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:58,872
-More violence!
-Hooray!

1007
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:00,709
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

1008
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,810
You know, that panda makes
a lot of good points.

1009
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:04,372
I like it.

1010
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:06,649
BUNNIES (chanting):
Violence! Violence! Violence!

1011
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,948
No, no, no, wait! Come back!

1012
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:11,478
I'll come up with better wisdom.

1013
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:14,316
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

1014
00:43:15,352 --> 00:43:17,660
-PO: Uh, the kung fu panda?
-Nope.

1015
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,629
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

1016
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,664
Those are both
very common names.

1017
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,633
-Mentored by Oogway?
-Sorry.

1018
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,129
Trained by Master Shifu?

1019
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,329
-Oh, Master Shifu.
-Aha!

1020
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:29,771
Yes. Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

1021
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:30,838
But not you.

1022
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:33,500
Did someone say "legendary"?

1023
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:34,974
Bring it in.

1024
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:39,143
Look, Han, I know
we've had our differences,

1025
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:40,683
but I'm really in a jam here,

1026
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,344
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

1027
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:44,247
-Thank you.
-Don't drink that.

1028
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:46,183
(sizzling)

1029
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:47,514
BUNNIES:
Ooh.

1030
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:49,483
(giggling)

1031
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,320
We just need someplace
to lie low

1032
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:52,827
for a while
until the heat cools off.

1033
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,488
And why should I help you?

1034
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:55,863
Because deep down, beneath that

1035
00:43:55,898 --> 00:43:58,129
iron-scaled exterior
is a good-hearted soul

1036
00:43:58,164 --> 00:44:00,461
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

1037
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,333
Fine. But if you're still here
by nightfall,

1038
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:06,170
I'm calling the bulls myself.

1039
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:09,745
Sleep tight. (laughing)

1040
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,539
(laughter fades)

1041
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:14,178
So tonight, we take down
The Chameleon.

1042
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:16,543
-After you get your pants back.
-(hooting)

1043
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:18,380
Not cool! You guys...

1044
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:21,515
Come on! Give them back.
Those are custom.

1045
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,550
(hooting)

1046
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:31,558
Yeah, this place doesn't look
very friendly.

1047
00:44:31,593 --> 00:44:35,661
Oh, my tail. (groans)

1048
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:38,906
I'm sure everything is fine.
This is a restaurant.

1049
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:42,008
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

1050
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:43,207
You wait here.

1051
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,243
-(door opens)
-Salutations!

1052
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:49,510
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
(chuckles)

1053
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:51,545
I know you're having
a good time, but I was

1054
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,857
wondering if a panda happened
to be passing by these parts?

1055
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:58,354
There was a panda here.

1056
00:44:58,389 --> 00:44:59,586
You know him?

1057
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:02,391
Know him? Why, I'm his dad.

1058
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,393
(quacking)

1059
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:05,933
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1060
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,528
Hmm?

1061
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:10,905
You need to pay for
what your son did to my tavern.

1062
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:15,008
(glass shatters)

1063
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:18,077
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

1064
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,178
Is it possible
your broth was bland?

he made a mess of this place,

what I'm capable of.

Mercy.

1079
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,022
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

1080
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:06,422
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

1081
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:10,800
The easy way, in which
you tell me where he is,

1082
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,661

you tell me where he is,

And so I chose a different path:

1242
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:35,095
(deeper voice):
sorcery.

1243
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,998
I grew.

1244
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:38,604
I excelled.

1245
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,443
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1246
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:44,313
Everything except kung fu.

1247
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:45,413
-(roars)
-(yelps)

1248
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,975
Just because I can look

1249
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,682
like Tai Lung doesn't mean
I can fight like him.

1250
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:52,079
(normal voice):
You see, Po,

1251
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:54,818
kung fu may be performed
by the body,

1252
00:54:54,853 --> 00:54:57,821
but its secrets are housed
in the spirit.

1253
00:54:57,856 --> 00:55:00,593
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm...

1254
00:55:00,628 --> 00:55:02,793
You're gonna steal
Tai Lung's kung fu.

1255
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:06,192
His and those of every master
villain that came before me.

1256
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:11,296
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

1257
00:55:11,331 --> 00:55:13,342
You forgot about me.

1258
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,839
(grunting fiercely)

1259
00:55:15,874 --> 00:55:17,973
(laughs) Don't bother, Po.

1260
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:21,009
Those bars are enchanted
with some very old

1261
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:23,044
and very powerful magic.

1262
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:27,180
You'd need at least ten Dragon
Warriors to get through them.

1263
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:28,819
Then I won't go through them.

1264
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:30,953
I'll go under them.

1265
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:33,054
(yelling)

1266
00:55:34,354 --> 00:55:36,024
(screams, groans)

1267
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,927
(grunts)

1268
00:55:39,898 --> 00:55:42,195
(weapons clanging)

1269
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,374
(low growling)

1270
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,871
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

1271
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:50,203
(muffled, distorted grunting)

1272
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:58,079
(grunting)

1273
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:04,184
(panting)

1274
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:05,559
Ah!

1275
00:56:06,694 --> 00:56:09,090
(door creaking)

1276
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,630
(guards yelling)

1277
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:13,364
(grunts)

1278
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,803
-(guards yelling)
-(panting)

1279
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:22,103
(grunting)

1280
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:23,709
(screeches)

1281
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:25,205
(both screaming)

1282
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,580
-ZHEN: Po!
-Zhen?

1283
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,551
-My staff. Hand it over.
-I'm so sorry I lied to you.

1284
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:32,278
I-I was just doing
what I was told.

1285
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:34,786
Apologize later. Right now
I have to stop The Chameleon.

1286
00:56:34,821 --> 00:56:36,381
Po!

1287
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,723
Zhen?

1288
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:39,890
(laughing)

1289
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,023
(panting)

1290
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:42,860
-(growls)
-(screaming)

1291
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:44,730
No!

1292
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:46,292
(screaming fades)

1293
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,100
Well done, Zhen.

1294
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:54,267
You never said
you were gonna hurt him.

1295
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:56,610
What's the second rule
of the streets?

1296
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:58,975
Someone always gets hurt.

1297
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,945
And make sure it's never you.

1298
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,981
I just wish there had been
another way.

1299
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:08,380
-Third rule of the streets?
-Third rule?

1300
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:11,119
Some would say
it's the most important.

1301
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:14,991
No one is interested
in your feelings.

1302
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,763
Chop-chop.

1303
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:20,161
We have a Spirit Realm
to plunder.

1304
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:21,998
And smile.

1305
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,165
Nobody likes a grouch.

1306
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,606
Honestly, Zhen,
I don't know where

1307
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:27,971
you pick up such bad habits.

1308
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,405
(grunting)

1309
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
(whimpers)

1310
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:36,749
Oh, if I could...

1311
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,520
(snarling)

1312
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:41,347
Hey there.

1313
00:57:41,382 --> 00:57:43,690
(shouts) Whoa!

1314
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:45,692
-(branch cracks)
-(straining)

1315
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,727
Get off me. Ow. Ow. Ah!

1316
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:51,467
-(screams, whimpers)
-(snarling)

1317
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:55,130
-(gasps)
-PING: Son!

1318
00:57:55,165 --> 00:57:56,505
(yells)

1319
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:59,332
(grunting rhythmically)

1320
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:00,707
(screaming)

1321
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:03,941
-Now save me.
-(grunts)

1322
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:05,305
Ah!

1323
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,143
-Hi, son.
-(branch snapping)

1324
00:58:08,178 --> 00:58:09,551
(both scream)

1325
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,312
It's okay. We've got you, Po.

1326
00:58:12,347 --> 00:58:13,852
We've got you.

1327
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,656
(wind whistling)

1328
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:16,855
PO:
So you followed me?

1329
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,560
-It was his idea.
-(grumbles)

1330
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,221
Okay, okay.
It was both our ideas.

1331
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:22,289
We only follow because we love.

1332
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:25,534
No, you followed because
you didn't believe in me.

1333
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,460
And because we love?

1334
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:31,397
Well, you're right.

1335
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:34,070
I screwed up big-time.

1336
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:35,874
I trusted the wrong person.

1337
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:39,207
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

1338
00:58:39,913 --> 00:58:42,177
Oh.

1339
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,915
Po...

1340
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,413
that was
a very big-time screwup.

1341
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,417
If only I'd listened
to Master Shifu

1342
00:58:51,452 --> 00:58:52,891
and stayed in
the Valley of Peace,

1343
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:54,662
The Chameleon
wouldn't have my staff

1344
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,422
and none of this
would be happening.

1345
00:58:56,457 --> 00:58:59,491
I was just so determined to
keep things the way they were.

1346
00:58:59,526 --> 00:59:02,868
Everyone is afraid
of change, Po.

1347
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:04,529
Even me.

1348
00:59:04,564 --> 00:59:07,708
There was a time,
not so long ago,

1349
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:09,171
when all I wanted to be

1350
00:59:09,206 --> 00:59:12,339
was the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

1351
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,846
So what happened?

1352
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:16,882
I became the greatest
noodle chef in the valley.

1353
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:20,050
-It's true.
-But I also became a father.

1354
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:23,889
And nothing... nothing's
ever been the same since.

1355
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,354
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

1356
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:29,730
Why do you think
I always change the menu

1357
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:30,929
at the restaurant?

1358
00:59:32,493 --> 00:59:35,032
Because if things stayed
the same forever,

1359
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:38,332
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

1360
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:41,775
He's right, Po.

1361
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,909
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

1362
00:59:43,944 --> 00:59:45,438
Strong. Brave.

1363
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:47,374
-(whip cracks)
-(whimpers)

1364
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:50,883
-GUARD: Move it. This way.
-(whip cracks)

1365
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:53,952
Get those cages up there.
Come on.

1366
00:59:53,987 --> 00:59:56,482
Mm. This looks bad.

1367
00:59:56,517 --> 00:59:58,759
-Really bad.
-GUARD: Move it!

1368
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:01,289
-(whip cracks)
-Come on.

1369
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,296
Don't tell me
you were actually starting

1370
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:10,232
to become friends
with that panda.

1371
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:12,740
What? No. I-It's just...

1372
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,236
When we want something,
we must use

1373
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:16,436
whatever is at our disposal
to get it.

1374
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:20,011
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

1375
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:23,509
Is that why you took me in?

1376
01:00:23,544 --> 01:00:26,083
So I could help you get
what you wanted?

1377
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:29,251
Zhen, I took you in
because you were clever

1378
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,990
and ruthless and unsentimental.

1379
01:00:32,025 --> 01:00:33,288
Like me.

1380
01:00:33,323 --> 01:00:35,455
And the day you stop being
those things

1381
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,866
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

1382
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:43,969
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

1383
01:00:44,004 --> 01:00:46,334
(latches clacking)

1384
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,780
Tonight,
when the blood moon rises

1385
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,541
to its highest point
in the night sky,

1386
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:58,687
I will open the door
to the Spirit Realm,

1387
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:02,053
and all of its secrets
will be mine!

1388
01:01:02,088 --> 01:01:03,824
(breathes heavily)

1389
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:10,028
Does a blood moon always rise
this slowly?

1390
01:01:12,065 --> 01:01:15,231
I seem to remember it
rising faster.

1391
01:01:16,168 --> 01:01:18,872
No? Just me?

1392
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,369
Hmm.

1393
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,141
Ugh.

1394
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:26,209
It's just for
dramatic effect anyway.

1395
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:29,718
(scoffs) I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1396
01:01:31,678 --> 01:01:33,579
(whooshing)

1397
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:35,350
♪ ♪

1398
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:43,094
Bring me Tai Lung!

1399
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,033
(roaring)

1400
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:51,905
(panting, growling)

1401
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:54,567
Tai Lung.

1402
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:56,206
Big fan.

1403
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,077
Who are you, and what are you
doing with that staff?

1404
01:01:59,112 --> 01:02:02,212
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1405
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:03,851
The puffy panda? (scoffs)

1406
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,018
Po might be an idiot,
but he'd never willingly

1407
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:09,120
hand over Oogway's staff
to the likes of you.

1408
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,518
Who said anything
about willingly?

1409
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:13,586
(mechanical rumbling)

1410
01:02:20,331 --> 01:02:21,561
Hmm.

1411
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:24,729
Apparently,
I misjudged you, lizard.

1412
01:02:24,764 --> 01:02:27,270
Now, why have you
brought me back?

1413
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:29,437
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1414
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:31,538
your most legendary
kung fu moves.

1415
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:34,640
I don't share my skills

01:11:37,624 --> 01:11:38,821
Run away!

1593
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:43,826
(grunting)

1594
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:46,697
Cannonball!

1595
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:48,028
(guard grunts)

1596
01:11:48,063 --> 01:11:51,570
-(laughing)
-(guards grunting)

1597
01:11:53,299 --> 01:11:55,200
-(slurps)
-Oh. Is it too spicy?

1598
01:11:55,235 --> 01:11:57,939
Mm-mm. No.
It's got the perfect kick.

1599
01:11:57,974 --> 01:11:59,347
Ginseng.

1600
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,712
That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1601
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,352
(clamoring)

1602
01:12:08,248 --> 01:12:09,852
That panda was right.

1603
01:12:09,887 --> 01:12:11,524
More violence later is better.

1604
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:15,088
BUNNIES:
Yay!

1605
01:12:19,226 --> 01:12:22,260
PO: I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1606
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,639
Can't you even die right?

1607
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:29,410
Can't you even kill wrong?

1608
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,808
No. (chuckles)
Wordplay didn't come together.

1609
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:33,513
Now, about that staff...

1610
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:36,912
Take it.

1611
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:39,750
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

1612
01:12:39,785 --> 01:12:41,983
I think this was destiny.

1613
01:12:42,018 --> 01:12:46,559
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

1614
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,397
alike in so many ways.

1615
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:51,025
If only I had a dumpling
for every time

1616
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,324
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

1617
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,096
It's true. We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1618
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:59,506
It's a shame only one of us
can come out on top.

1619
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,771
It is a shame.

1620
01:13:00,806 --> 01:13:02,102
For you.

1621
01:13:02,137 --> 01:13:03,840
THE CHAMELEON:
My combined powers

1622
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,942
of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1623
01:13:06,977 --> 01:13:08,515
And once I dispense with you,

1624
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,551
I'll expand my rule
from Juniper City to...

1625
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:13,014
Every other city
and town and village

1626
01:13:13,049 --> 01:13:15,049
from here to
the Valley of Peace and beyond.

1627
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:16,347
Yeah, I know.

1628
01:13:16,382 --> 01:13:18,382
But how did you know?

1629
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:20,186
I saw it in a vision.

1630
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:22,320
'Cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

1631
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:25,730
For now, at least.

1632
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:29,965
But I've realized that it's
probably time I made a change.

1633
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,901
And so should you.

1634
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:34,805
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

1635
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,543
Only on the outside.

1636
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,974
Real change happens from within.

1637
01:13:39,009 --> 01:13:41,405
And if we're really as alike
as you say,

1638
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,946
then maybe we could both
let go of who we were

1639
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:47,114
and become something better
than we already are.

1640
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:48,489
What do you say?

1641
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,721
I say...

1642
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:51,052
(screeches)

1643
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:52,152
(grunts)

1644
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:53,692
Well, I saw that coming.

1645
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,729
We're very proud of you.

1646
01:13:57,764 --> 01:13:58,928
You tried it our way.

1647
01:13:58,963 --> 01:14:00,930
Now try it yours.

1648
01:14:00,965 --> 01:14:03,229
BOTH:
Kick her butt.

1649
01:14:03,264 --> 01:14:05,297
I'm way ahead of you.

1650
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:06,837
(grunting)

1651
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:13,173
(grunts) Hmm?

1652
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,208
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist?

1653
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,049
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror!

1654
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,250
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury!

1655
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,449
(screams)

1656
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:26,923
(barks)

1657
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,188
(bellows)

1658
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,059
Ooh. Master Bull's
Horns of Doom!

1659
01:14:32,062 --> 01:14:33,160
(growling)

1660
01:14:33,195 --> 01:14:34,458
What?

1661
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:35,932
(distorted):
Recognize this move?

1662
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,296
(screams)

1663
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:38,363
(panting)

1664
01:14:38,398 --> 01:14:39,606
Is that how I sound?

1665
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,135
I don't sound like that, do I?

1666
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,840
PO:
You didn't earn those skills!

1667
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,204
You just stole 'em!

1668
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,436
(grunting)

1669
01:14:45,471 --> 01:14:47,009
Give him a left.
A right. Uppercut.

1670
01:14:47,044 --> 01:14:48,978
-Which one are you rooting for?
-I'm not sure.

1671
01:14:49,013 --> 01:14:50,683
This is all very confusing.

1672
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,345
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

1673
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,821
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

1674
01:14:56,856 --> 01:14:59,054
Po! (yelling)

1675
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:01,023
(yell fading)

1676
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:02,090
(growls)

1677
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:04,664
(chuckles nervously)

1678
01:15:04,699 --> 01:15:06,193
(clangs)

1679
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,197
(grunts)

1680
01:15:10,232 --> 01:15:13,167
Whoa. I got to workshop
those heroic entrances.

1681
01:15:13,202 --> 01:15:15,037
Nah. It was just right.

1682
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:16,676
(grunting)

1683
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:18,579
(distorted):
I knew I should've left you

1684
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,647
to rot in the gutter
where you belong.

1685
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,814
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1686
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:24,717
(grunts, blows)

1687
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:25,949
(grunts)

1688
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:32,252
BOTH:
Hi-yah!

1689
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:33,561
Two against one?

1690
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:35,519
Well, now,
that doesn't seem fair.

1691
01:15:35,554 --> 01:15:38,423
I'll have to even the odds.

1692
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,601
(distorted):
Master Cobra.

1693
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,263
Master Osprey.

1694
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:45,430
(echoing):
Master Scorpion.

1695
01:15:45,465 --> 01:15:47,366
Master Wolf.

1696
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:49,907
General Kai.

1697
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,403
Lord Shen.

1698
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,407
(deep, distorted laugh)

1699
01:15:55,442 --> 01:15:59,378
That is awesome!

1700
01:15:59,413 --> 01:16:02,117
I mean, it's disturbing,
but it's awesome.

1701
01:16:02,152 --> 01:16:04,152
(roaring)

1702
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:10,895
(shouts)

1703
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,765
Whoa!

1704
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,459
(screams)

1705
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:17,264
(roaring)

1706
01:16:18,168 --> 01:16:19,871
Whoa!

1707
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:22,434
Zhen!

1708
01:16:29,245 --> 01:16:30,684
(yelling)

1709
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,317
(pained roaring)

1710
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:44,522
Whoa, whoa!

1711
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:49,230
(roaring)

1712
01:16:49,265 --> 01:16:51,969
(yelling)

1713
01:16:52,004 --> 01:16:54,433
(grunting)

1714
01:16:54,468 --> 01:16:55,940
(groans)

1715
01:16:55,975 --> 01:16:58,338
Po!

1716
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:04,685
(distorted cackling)

1717
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,610
(distorted):
I thought we were friends.

1718
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:08,348
(gasps)

1719
01:17:08,383 --> 01:17:09,514
Stand back.

1720
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:11,857
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1721
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:17,731
(explosive booming)

1722
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,734
(grunts)

1723
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,806
Yah!

1724
01:17:34,211 --> 01:17:36,178
(grunting)

1725
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,095
Whoa!

1726
01:17:55,562 --> 01:17:57,067
(yelling)

1727
01:17:57,102 --> 01:17:58,332
(distorted laughing)

1728
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:00,598
(yelling)

1729
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:14,920
(feet screech)

1730
01:18:14,955 --> 01:18:16,218
(sizzling)

1731
01:18:16,253 --> 01:18:17,351
(screams)

1732
01:18:17,386 --> 01:18:18,418
(blowing)

1733
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:27,130
(grunting)

1734
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:31,464
(grunting fiercely)

1735
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:36,876
-Come on, Po. Get out of there.
-You have to do this.

1736
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:38,273
I can't beat The Chameleon.

1737
01:18:38,308 --> 01:18:39,879
A wise old tortoise once told me

1738
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:42,178
that you never know
what you can do until you do it.

1739
01:18:42,213 --> 01:18:44,213
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1740
01:18:44,248 --> 01:18:47,018
and you're here giving me
life advice from a tortoise?

1741
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:48,580
Be the pit, Zhen.

1742
01:18:48,615 --> 01:18:50,956
Be the pit.

1743
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,092
♪ ♪

1744
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,363
And what do you think
you're doing?

1745
01:19:02,398 --> 01:19:04,101
Finishing what Po started.

1746
01:19:04,136 --> 01:19:06,972
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1747
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,237
(grunts)

1748
01:19:08,272 --> 01:19:10,877
Don't slouch.

1749
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,076
(grunts)

1750
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:13,638
(gasping)

1751
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,081
(grunting)

1752
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,449
You ungrateful little urchin!

1753
01:19:22,484 --> 01:19:26,860
After all I've done for you,
you betray me for the panda?

1754
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:29,654
First rule of the streets:

1755
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,623
never trust anyone.

1756
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:33,328
Ha! You can't defeat me.

1757
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:35,099
I know all your moves.

1758
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:36,727
Not this one.

1759
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:39,466
Roll, stir,

1760
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:41,809
serve and ska-blam!

1761
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:42,876
(roaring)

1762
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:45,879
(screams)

1763
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:49,982
-(cheering)
-(laughing) Yes!

1764
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:53,744
Second rule:
someone always gets hurt.

1765
01:19:53,779 --> 01:19:55,581
Now, that's a cool move.

1766
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:58,419
Po. You could've gotten out of
that cage anytime you wanted?

1767
01:19:58,454 --> 01:19:59,827
You faker.

1768
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:01,620
It's not faking. It's Method.

1769
01:20:01,655 --> 01:20:04,832
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

1770
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:07,659
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

1771
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,840
And, hey, you stirred faster
