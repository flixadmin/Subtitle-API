00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,260
We've managed to stabilize
the God Particle

2
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,918
and consequently the resulting mass.

3
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,335
In a stable state it seems
to create a kind of portal,

4
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:19,172
which possibly allows for time travel.

5
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:23,007
Supplied with sufficient
voltage the matter can be kept

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,378
in a stable state in the long term.

7
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:29,592
Sending objects through
the stabilized matter

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,212
has proven possible.

9
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:45,047
A generator has to supply
sufficient AC current for that.

10
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:48,667
Despite lengthy observation,
we have yet to determine

11
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,665
the matter's energy source.

12
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:53,335
It would appear to be
running entirely on its own.

13
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,962
The readings indicate that
there is no loss of energy.

14
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:02,262
It seems to be a recursive,
self-sustainable system.

15
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:16,377
Radiation emanating from the
matter is above control values.

16
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:20,423
Yet there are no signs of deterioration.

17
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:24,165
This is consistent with the
principle of conservation of energy,

18
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,045
yet contradicts the second
law of thermodynamics.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,130
The matter seems to exist independent
of external temperatures...

20
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:36,297
in solid, liquid and gaseous
states simultaneously.

21
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,547
Its molecules are continually rearranged

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,420
in a cyclical process.

23
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:14,587
June 22, 1987

24
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:18,092
Five days until the Apocalypse

25
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,048
Hey, sleepyhead. We're
running a little late today.

26
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:16,302
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

27
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,592
Just one week, then you're on vacation.

28
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,958
But it's my mom's birthday.

29
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,585
You know what we said, hmm?

30
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:46,382
The past is the past, you know.

31
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,587
And now is now.

32
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,047
Shall we?

33
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,630
Let's go.

34
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,875
Regina, you'll be late!

35
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,633
The French delegation
is visiting the plant.

36
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:14,343
- I can't make it today.
- No problem.

37
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:16,422
I'm not doing anything at all.

38
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,705
- Regina!
- I can do this more often.

39
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,087
Regina!

40
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:29,052
Where did you find this little one?

41
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,883
- She looks like Gretchen.
- For God's sake.

42
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,627
Regina, where are you?

43
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,213
Listen.

44
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:45,343
I want to talk while I'm here.

45
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,302
There's something I really
need to tell you about.

46
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,090
Hi, Grandpa. We going?

47
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:58,923
Don't say goodbye, no problem!

48
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,295
Tell me what?

49
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:05,592
It's nothing.

50
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,923
All right. Goodbye, then.

51
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,383
Police

52
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:36,705
January 8, 1921 sic mundus creatus est

53
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:49,255
"Sic mundus creatus
est. Thus the world was created."

54
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:56,418
The Tiedemann interview.

55
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,005
You forget?

56
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:01,548
No. I thought you wanted to do it alone.

57
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,955
What's wrong? Have
something better to do?

58
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:08,798
No. It's just, I'm wondering
why Mrs. Tiedemann is first.

59
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,593
There's no link to the missing persons.

60
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,418
The missing all disappeared near
the caves or the nuclear power plant.

61
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:20,672
It's also true

62
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:24,197
of your colleague Ulrich
Nielsen's brother in 1986.

63
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,172
And then...

64
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:31,133
there's also that door we found
to the nuclear plant, underground.

65
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,090
How long have Aleksander Tiedemann
and his wife been married?

66
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:39,132
I really don't know.

67
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,340
Regina was...

68
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,417
mid-20s.

69
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:45,545
How come?

70
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,340
It's not unusual?

71
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:50,512
What?

72
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:54,128
That Aleksander Tiedemann took the
name of his wife when he married?

73
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,840
No.

74
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,127
We going?

75
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,337
- Coming?
- Yup.

76
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,132
Hey, where have you been?

77
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:44,962
Why didn't you call back? I've
been trying to reach you all day.

78
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,093
Last year.

79
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,132
I know where you got the cash.

80
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,713
Blow job 40 euros, anal 45?

81
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:56,278
Kinky games extra? Who'd you do it with?

82
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:59,433
Who've you been sucking
off in this fucking town?

83
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,960
Nothing's changed! All
the lying, everybody.

84
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,343
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- I followed you.

85
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,342
I know where you got the cash.

86
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:15,128
- Your first thought is I'm a prostitute?
- What else could I think?

87
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,545
I don't sell my tits or my ass.

88
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,280
I fucking sell hormone
therapy prescriptions.

89
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,302
My father used to pay
for his visits with them.

90
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:27,708
Since he hasn't been able
to, I'm the new source.

91
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,710
Why do you do it?

92
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,507
I help her, she helps
me. That's all it is.

93
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,431
The secrets are never the problem,

94
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,321
it's what everyone in
this town projects.

95
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:45,463
Besides, I said it doesn't
concern you and it doesn't.

96
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:49,087
I can't believe you've been spying
on me. How fucked up is that?

97
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,343
What is that?

98
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:39,915
A time machine.

99
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,255
You can travel 33 years into the past

100
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:49,458
or 33 years into the future.

101
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:02,093
You're serious, huh?

102
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,210
I did it all wrong.

103
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,378
I meant to keep it secret.

104
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,668
But you see, that's
exactly what's behind this.

105
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,588
The secrets.

106
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:23,093
Mom, I know it seems insane.

107
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,458
I want you to see for yourself,

108
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,047
with your own eyes.

109
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:31,883
Meaning?

110
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,670
Dad's secret, I mean.

111
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:01,878
Out of my way, douchebag!

112
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,837
Hey, Hannah, come on.

113
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:14,457
What are you staring at?

114
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:33,298
Thank God you're here. There's
someone's waiting in your office.

115
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,380
I didn't know...

116
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,713
It... It's the dog.

117
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,133
She says it belongs to her.

118
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,422
Is she yours?

119
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm so sorry.

120
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,955
She ran to me.

121
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,915
The animal shelter said no
one had reported her missing.

122
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:20,455
And she looks like the
dog I had as a little girl.

123
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:21,547
Gretchen.

124
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,550
How did you know that?

125
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,257
Because it's my dog.

126
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,840
Just like it is yours.

127
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:48,553
Excuse me?

128
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,547
And the blood levels?

129
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:55,923
So it's already spread.

130
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,053
The hospital?

131
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,375
Friday already?

132
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,457
Oh, no.

133
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,803
Yeah, okay. That'll work.

134
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:15,915
Don't worry. I have someone.

135
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:17,665
Yeah.

136
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:51,627
No trace of Mads Nielsen almost
a year after his disappearance

137
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,300
Police diary 1986

138
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:05,045
10:30 A.M. interview: Helge Doppler
Why not through the forest?

139
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,513
Why not through the forest?

140
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:12,045
I know it's hard to believe.

141
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,625
But I remember.

142
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,423
What?

143
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,302
This exact moment.

144
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,378
Go to the window.

145
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,298
Trust me.

146
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:38,263
There are two people at their
desks, Hermann und Kowaltschik.

147
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:42,016
Our secretary will approach the desk.

148
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,116
She'll fan her face on the way.

149
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,545
Watch Kowaltschik.

150
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,760
He's about to drop his pen.

151
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,552
You should be more careful.
Someone could trip.

152
00:16:57,547 --> 00:16:58,917
What's this all about?

153
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,380
It happened to me.

154
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,627
All you have experienced,
all you've ever been.

155
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,710
I am you.

156
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:11,627
And I was told by me that
you and I are the same person.

157
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,343
This can't be real.

158
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:24,883
This is Gretchen.

159
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:30,263
The day she ran into the caves
I was there waiting for her.

160
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,838
Knew me as if I hadn't aged a day.

161
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,797
I made sure she would
find you on the other side.

162
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Some things have to happen
exactly the way they always have.

163
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,592
The cave.

164
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,383
Everything last summer.

165
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,505
There was something else!

166
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,422
♪ We're caught in a trap ♪

167
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,763

184
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:21,335
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- What do you mean?

185
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:25,047
This book we're
reading in school right now.

186
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,050
It's about the ghosts and demons

187
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,260
we inherit from our parents.

188
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
And the ones we pass on.

189
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:37,212
Dark stuff.

190
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:41,303
From generation to generation.

191
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:45,962
I guess.

192
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:51,713
But you only got your mom's
best features, if you ask me.

193
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:55,923
- I didn't even know she had any.
- No?

194
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,423
You have no idea.

195
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,633
She's never there.

196
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,460
And when she is, all she
does is complain about me.

197
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,628
She's never said, "I love you, Regina."

198
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,173
Let me, then.

199
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:31,511
How would you describe

200
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:33,657
your relationship with Ulrich Nielsen?

201
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:37,263
We don't have a relationship
with any of the Nielsens at all.

202
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:43,763
Mm-hmm. The day before he
disappeared he was at your hotel.

203
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,672
What did he want?

204
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,710
He wanted to know
what really happened in 1986.

205
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:55,917
Because I was the last person to
see his brother before he died.

206
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:03,668
Your husband.

207
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:06,548
He came to Winden...

208
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:10,838
Since 1986.

209
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:14,587
- Why do you ask?
- Why did he take your last name?

210
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:19,457
I don't understand. What does
my name have to do with this?

211
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:22,207
- I think we're done here.
- Sh! Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

212
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,713
There's still something else.

213
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,130
No?

214
00:23:36,255 --> 00:23:38,795
Last year a man came to the hotel.

215
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,075
Those are his things.

216
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:51,048
He wanted a room.

217
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,803
He looked like a homeless person.

218
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:57,545
He paid cash.

219
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,632
He left after a few days. He
wanted to keep the room, though.

220
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,507
He never came back.

221
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:10,052
These were covering the walls.

222
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:17,302
When he left, he asked me
to deliver a package for him.

223
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,255
To whom?

224
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,382
Jonas Kahnwald.

225
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,802
You kept this secret?

226
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:41,012
I have to go. Elisabeth has swim class.

227
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,128
I totally forgot.

228
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,423
I'm sorry. You can take a taxi home.

229
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,128
Well...

230
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,380
This strange man...

231
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,633
What did he look like?

232
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:51,713
What is this?

233
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,258
Why are we here?

234
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:01,553
It's safer to travel from here.

235
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,510
I meant it when I said it'd
be easier once you've seen it.

236
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,420
Don't be scared.

237
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:43,005
Shouldn't you be at school?

238
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,207
I know you.

239
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,133
You were at the hospital.

240
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:02,955
I come here a lot.

241
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:05,423
It's special here.

242
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,625
So...

243
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,760
Why aren't you at school?

244
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,457
Mm!

245
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:23,665
I get it. Sometimes we don't
really know where we should be.

246
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:30,627
I wouldn't be going in there.

247
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,843
It's like a maze in there.

248
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,705
Some don't come back out.

249
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,958
At the hospital,

250
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,877
something you said...

251
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:48,758
about God

252
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:52,048
and how he has a plan for everyone.

253
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,710
What if God doesn't
know what he's doing?

254
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:59,342
If the plan is wrong? If God is wrong?

255
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:02,795
God is never wrong.

256
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:10,588
Sometimes we need faith that
things will get better for us again.

257
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,883
I've been meaning to for a long time.

258
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:38,343
To come by here.

259
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:43,008
Now that I'm retired,
I mean, it's easy to do.

260
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,915
I...

261
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,133
Mads' disappearance.

262
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:03,262
It still haunts me.

263
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:06,092
That day...

264
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,213
You were working at the plant that day.

265
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:14,593
You said you took the country lane home,

266
00:30:14,672 --> 00:30:16,592
but that's the long way.

267
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:21,628
Tell me why you wouldn't
take the forest road?

268
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,048
He said...

269
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,800
he could change it.

270
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:33,423
That he could change
everything, the future and past.

271
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:35,588
Who told you that?

272
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:38,302
The man with the stone.

273
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,007
But that was 30 years ago.

274
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,755
What's this to do with Mads at all?

275
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:46,338
Nobody can change it. Nobody!

276
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,297
Not even the white devil!

277
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,918
The white devil?

278
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:56,375
You've talked about all this
before. You were just a child.

279
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,883
Tick, tock.

280
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:08,173
Tick, tock.

281
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,050
Tick, tock.

282
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,383
I want you to believe

283
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,074
in an idea that is bigger than you,

284
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,170
bigger than any of us.

285
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,712
What is that?

286
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:27,012
This is mankind's greatest discovery,

287
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,208
and also its doom.

288
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,338
It lets you travel through time.

289
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:35,797
Thirty-three years backwards.

290
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,208
Thirty-three years forwards.

291
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:44,383
And it will take exactly 33 years
till the cycle is complete again.

292
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,633
You will stand here where I am standing.

293
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:50,963
And you will accept
your part in all of this,

294
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:54,457
and what it means you'll be losing.

295
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,263
In five days everything starts over.

296
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:00,165
You must stop Adam.

297
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,420
Who is Adam?

298
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,920
You don't understand it yet.

299
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,762
But you will soon.

300
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,758
But until then everything will
happen the way it always has.

301
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:25,627
The way it has to.

302
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,840
In the end, life is just a
collection of missed opportunities.

303
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:39,262
You don't have much time with Regina.

304
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,342
But if everything works out...

305
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,380
she will live.

306
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:03,627
A journey through time

307
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,463
Charlotte?

308
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:14,707
Charlotte?

309
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,172
Are you okay?

310
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,045
Last year, when the kids went missing...

311
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,665
a man was at Regina's hotel.

312
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:26,955
He had some drawing with him, copies.

313
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,713
What kind of drawings?

314
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:31,417
They're from the book.

315
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:35,877
The book my grandfather wrote,
Peter. A Journey through Time.

316
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:39,713
- They all said he was crazy.
- Where are you now?

317
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,167
But he knew that it was all true.

318
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,128
Why did he have that photo?

319
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,165
And why didn't he ever say
who my parents really were?

320
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,798
"You... You know the rules."

321
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:31,625
"Do you think they don't apply to you?"

322
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:36,036
Why are you lying?

323
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:39,258
About what's really in the dead zone!

324
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,048
Ah! Ah!

325
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,585
Ah!

326
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:51,412
In five days, in my time,
everybody is going to die.

327
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:52,727
I have to stop that!

328
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,625
There is no prophecy!

329
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,512
The passage will never open!

330
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:03,013
Your paradise is nothing but lies!

331
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:04,877
But behind the wall...

332
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,340
Winden boy missing

333
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:45,132
Hello. This is Egon.

334
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:47,303
Missing person report: Mads Nielsen

335
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,300
Listen, back in 1953, we arrested a man.

336
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,010
Mads Nielsen case: Police in dark

337
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:53,615
What happened to him after 1953?

338
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,050
He killed two children and
kidnapped Helge Doppler.

339
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:57,147
No result

340
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,172
Yes.

341
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,342
I was wondering, what
ever happened to the guy?

342
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,838
Yes, I'll wait.

343
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:11,883
Is this man a child killer?

344
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:13,295
Yes?

345
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,383
Okay, you have the file.

346
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,875
But he can't still be here!

347
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:23,838
Where?

348
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,630
Yes?

349
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:51,553
Chief Inspector Tiedemann.

350
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,545
I'm here to speak with a patient.

351
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,417
Was anyone told I was coming?

352
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,303
Not that I know of.

353
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:05,878
Well, well.

354
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:09,213
File number...

355
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,047
K-5-3.

356
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:16,165
Must've been here for 34 years.

357
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,668
The Inspector?

358
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,710
That's what we call him here.

359
00:38:23,797 --> 00:38:26,672
Nice guy. I wasn't even
born when he came.

360
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,139
He's like a permanent fixture.

361
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:33,262
- He'll be happy to finally have a visitor.
- Does he...

362
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:36,548
- get day release?
- No.

363
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,590
That ward is closed.

364
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,545
That one, with the long gray hair.

365
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,800
Thank you.

366
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,343
Excuse me, please.

367
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:24,457
I don't know if you
recognize me, but, uh...

368
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,590
my name is Egon Tiedemann.

369
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:31,957
I arrested you 34 years ago.

370
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:40,508
Egon Tiedemann.

371
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:49,335
Of course I remember you.

372
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,422
I...

373
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:57,088
I wanted...

374
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,547
some of your time.

375
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,130
"My only aim is to take many
lives. The more, the better I feel."

376
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,093
I've heard that.

377
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,090
You've said those words before.

378
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,130
What the hell does it mean?

379
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:28,712
It means you're still an
idiot who doesn't understand.

380
00:40:31,172 --> 00:40:33,382
You have to hurry now.

381
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:35,383
You don't have much time.

382
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,838
Until you're dead and buried.

383
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:40,375
It was in the papers.

384
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:47,762
- I'm not following you.
- No, of course you aren't.

385
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:51,455
Maybe that's your fate.

386
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:55,047
To die as clueless as
you were born, you know?

387
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:01,508
Everybody gets what they deserve.

388
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,548
Where were you?

389
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,133
I've been so worried, Mikkel.

390
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,093
I called the school. They
said you weren't there.

391
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,760
Something happen?

392
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,378
You know what?

393
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:54,963
There are some days you
just have to forget about.

394
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,587
But...

395
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,050
there's no better comfort food
I know than "Toast Hawaii".

396
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,673
Way back when I was little we'd
have this, with two cherries on top.

397
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:13,665
And my dad used to dance, like Elvis.

398
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,840
Pineapples

399
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:17,842
Do you believe in God?

400
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,210
Mm-hmm.

401
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:27,054
Do you think he has a plan?

402
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:35,625
I believe that.

403
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:36,713
Yeah.

404
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:42,262
I believe, for example,
that God made sure

405
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:44,208
you came to me.

406
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,843
And that his plan for me is to...

407
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,207
to take care of you.

408
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,758
So, let's make this
"Toast Hawaii", yeah?

409
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,088
Give me a hand?

410
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,008
Why didn't she kill you?

411
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:25,423
Who are you, really?

412
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:29,548
Tell me now!

413
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,628
So show me, then.

414
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:01,457
What's really in the dead zone?

415
00:48:58,297 --> 00:49:01,957
Building your family's happiness

416
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,262
What is that?

417
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:40,802
She said that it's a portal.

418
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:42,588
Who?

419
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,625
Tapes of a woman talking.

420
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:49,133
Her name is Claudia Tiedemann.
I know it sounds crazy.

421
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,828
But that could very well
be our way to get home.

422
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:55,835
I don't know if it works.

423
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:22,165
You're going in?

424
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:29,128
Whether I die out here or
in there doesn't matter.

425
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:57,955
Jonas!
